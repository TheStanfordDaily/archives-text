April 14, 1969
I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

Council and some staff of
Stanford University.)

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21

Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21

Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20

National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and

Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21

with BMD in a Direct
Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21

with Ballistic Missile
Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is

2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the

In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making

and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21
Civil Defense Interactions
with BMD in a Direct
Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21
Civil Defense Interactions
with Ballistic Missile
Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000

Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.

2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military

Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21
Civil Defense Interactions
with BMD in a Direct
Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21
Civil Defense Interactions
with Ballistic Missile
Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21

Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21

Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20

National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and

Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21

with BMD in a Direct
Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21
Civil Defense Interactions
with Ballistic Missile
Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before
;ale to ensure that in the opinion
:>f counsel the restrictions on sale
.hat are proposed are legally
?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda
ions, favoring closer ties.
In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:
SRI-TR-5205-20
A Methodology For
National Deployment of
Local Ballistic Missile
Defense Batteries.
AD-390 520 L 68-15 F
LD. 16/4
SED-RM-5 205-46
National Effectiveness
Evaluation Methods for
BMD
AD-389 770 L 68-13
FLD 15/3.1
In addition the Institute is
studying a series of civil defense
projects related to missile defense,
as follows:
SRI-RM-5205-18
A Metholodology for
Estimating Fallout
Casualties.
SRI-RM-5205-19
Light Attack Shelter
Requirements and Defense
Avoidance Fallout Tactics.
SRI-RM-5205-21

with BMD in a Direct
Attack.
SRI-RM-5205-22
Computer Implementation
of the Miller Fallout Model.
SRI-TR-5250-21

Defense.
PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.

The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
trustees, as SRl's general
members, have the sole voice in
selecting SRl's board of directors.
2) SRl's board of directors in
turn has full authority over its
operations: "... the powers of
the corporation shall be exercised,
its property controlled and its
affairs conducted by the
directors."
3) Although "ownership" is a
more tangled concept in the case
of a non-profit corporation, in an
ultimate sense it can be said that
Stanford University owns SRI:
"Upon the dissolution or winding
up of the corporation, all funds
and property remaining after
paying or adequately providing
for the debets and obligations of
the corporation shall be
distributed to the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." It is, in short,
reasonably accurate to express the
Stanford-SRI affiliation as
essentially a parent-subsidi; ry
relationship.
The Bylaws spell out the
procedural rules of operation for
the members and directors as well
as delineating the power of the
board:
1) Concerning election of
directors: "the president of the
Leland Stanford Junior University
and the president of the Board of
Trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University, by virture of
their offices, shall be members of
the board of directors. Other
directors shall be elected by the
general members who may, at
their discretion, elect not more
than four (4) directors who are
members of the administrative or
teaching staff of the Leland
Stanford Junior University." The
number of directors has been
increased over the years, from the
original 11 to 42 today; in 1968,
9 of the 42 were trustees of
Stanford, and one was a member
of its administrative or teaching
staff.
2) Concerning powers of
directors: The directors are
endowed with the usual power
over finances, budgets and
property accorded most corporate
boards. This includes the power to
"appoint and remove at pleasure
the officers of the
corporation ..." The board also
"shall appoint a president" who
"shall have the power to employ
and discharge all employees." The
board is specifically empowered
to review and determine "The
amounts which from time to time
shall be devoted to, given or
turned over to the board of
trustees of the Leland Stanford
Junior University in furtherance
of its general educational
purposes ..."
Despite the University's
unquestioned power of legal
control over the Institute, it has in
practice largely allowed the
Institute's management to chart
its own course. This was not true
In the early years, when SRI was
losing money and the University
had to make advances to it of over
$600,000 (repaid by 1965), nor
was it entirely true in 1965 when
the fund-raising activities of SRI
came into conflict with those of
the University. But apart from
such episodes of concern over the
financial losses SRI might cause
the University, the Stanford
Board of Trustees appears to have
made no formal exercise of its
power to establish the direction of
SRI activities or implement the
purposes that underlay SRl's
formation by the University. The
result, predictably enough, was to
leave SRl's management and
directors free to a considerable
degree to pursue the Institute's
own interests as an independent
entity. How this has worked out is
depicted in the next section.
D. Aspects of Growth
and Development
1. Growth and Size
of the Institute
The story of SRI in the over

twenty years of its existence has
been one of rapid expansion in
staff and contracts and, more
recently, in financial strength. The
table below shows the growth of
SRl's employment over the years:
Year SRI Staff
1947 43
1952 535
1957 1,340
1962 1,980
1968 3,068
Located originally in a few
buildings in the old Stanford
Village in Menlo Park, permanent
SRI personnel are now working in
offices in five different states in
the U.S. and in at least eleven
foreign countries, occupying over
a million square feet of building
space.
As of December 1968 the
breakdown of SRI staff by
personnel classification was as
follows:
Administrative 180
Professional 1,512
Technical 524
Non-technical 232
Clerical 620
Total 3,068
These persons are distributed
throughout the organization in
four major research divisions:
Physical and Life Sciences,
Engineering, Economics, and
Management and Systems
Sciences. The organization chart
of SRI is set forth on the next
page.
The growth of annual research
volume achieved by the Institute
has also been dramatic:
Annual Project Revenue
Year Dollars
(in thousands)
1947 81
1950 2,000
1955 9,900
1960 26,000
1968 64,210
Finally, the expansion in number
of new projects undertaken is
another index of the Institute's
steady growth.
New Projects
1950 124
1955 309
1960 397
1965 503
1968 681
2. Evolution in Sources
of Support and
Composition of Research
One of the most striking
developments in the growth of
SRI is the shift in its research
from private industry to
government sponsorship.
Originally dedicated to "industrial
research" yet leaving open the
possibility of government
contracts so as not to limit its
scope, it soon found itself
expanding rapidly in the area of
government research.
In its 1948 Annual Report, the
Institute reaffirmed its dedication
to private industry:
"The Institute was established
to make applied research
available to industry,
particularly industry of the
eleven Western states.
Although a major portion of its
projects are carried on in the
field of industrial research, it
has undertaken a number of
government contracts of
importance to national
prosperity and
defensense. ... Its facilities are
available to large and small
enterprises alike."
By the 1949 Annual Report
government work seemed to be a
more integral part of SRl's
purpose. "The Institute's major
purpose —the primary service it
can perform—is to apply
fundamental scientific knowledge
to the technologic and economic
problems of industry and
government."
A year later the importance of
government sponsored research
(in dollar terms) had grown to
substantial proportions (40%) and
by 1960 it had become dominant
in the Institute (63%).

Sponsorship
of SRI Research
Government Commercial
1950 40% 60%
1955 43 57
1960 63 37
1965 82 18
1968 71 29
The expansion of government
sponsored research was stimulated
in the period of the early fifties
by the Korean war, and military
research seems always to have
constituted the major portion of
government contracts.
Data available for recent years
indicates a moderate reversal of
this trend:
Government Military
as % of Total as % of
Gov. (approx.)
1965 82% 78%
1966 78% 73%
1967 78% 74%
1968 71% 73%
3. Military Research
In the beginning there was no
perceived cause for concern over a
growing incidence of military
work. Indeed industrial research
and military work were seen in
the 1951 Annual Report as quite
compatible:
" . ..military demands for
research closely parallel
industrial needs. The Institute
therefore, found its skills and
facilities immediately
applicable to military
programs, whether technical or
logistic, and could actually
participate in the national
defense programs.'"
In recent years, however,
concern has been evidenced at
SRI about undue dependence on
government work in general and
military work in particular in the
Institute's research contracts.
1965 was the peak year for both
in percentage terms and the
Institute has been engaged since in
a conscious effort to expand other
sectors and reduce its dependence
on this kind of work. The figures in
the previous table reflect the
success achieved to date, but SRI
military research activity is still
large and diversified and
constitutes about 50% of its total
work. It is mostly classified, and a
substantial part of the research
results and knowledge thereby
acquired is not generally available.
The Committee could not
undertake, therefore, any sort of
project review procedure, since
the necessary information could
not have been made available to
all its members.
Research on chemical and
biological warfare (CBW) and
counter-insurgency measures has
been a source of particular
controversy. In 1968, CBW
research at SRI amounted to
about $400,000 or .6% of total
research revenue; of a February
28, 1969, total contract backlog
of approximately $25 million,
roughly $50,000 or 2/10 of 1%
was in the CBW field. Past activity
of SRI in this area is greater than
these current figures would
suggest, and has involved
substantial studies of aerosol
behavior and dissemination of
chemical agents. A statement to
the Committee on this subject by
SRI is as follows:
The Institute has conducted
and is conducting research for
agencies of the Government
which have a preparedness
mission in the field of chemical
and biological warfare. The
current level of work at the
Institute in support of those
agencies and their missions is
minimal, the current backlog
being approximately $50,000,
which is roughly equivalent to
a one-man-year effort. The
general thrust of the work in
this program concerns the
detection, dissemination and
defensive aspects of such
activity.
In connection with both CW
and BW research, it has been
the policy of the Institute not
to have weapons or materials at
our facilities which, through

accident or inadvertence, could
possibly create a danger or
health hazard for the local
community. Because of its
special sensitivity, I think it is
important to emphasize that
there are no biological agents
at Institute facilities.
"Counterinsurgency" research
is less easily defined, since as the
term is sometimes used it can
range from military techniques
especially adapted for use against
armed guerrillas to any social or
economic study or project which
might strengthen the existing
order in an Asian, African or
Latin American country.
Approaching this subject from a
slightly different angle, the
amount of military research
directly related to Southeast Asia
performed by SRI in 1968
amounted to $6Vi million or
about 10% of SRl's total work.
Counterinsurgency projects have
included research on such matters
as "strategic hamlets" in Vietnam,
jungle communications and
intrusion sensors in Thailand, and
the advisability of operational
assistance to Government forces
in Peru.
4. Development of
SRI International Operations
The growth of SRl's
international operations is one of
the more important long term
trends of Institute development.
In the early fifties the Institute
considered its specific aims in
international operations to be to
"widen SRl's sphere of knowledge
and capabilities so as to serve
industry and government (at
home and abroad), more
effectively assist in solving some
of the world's economic
development problems, strengthen
the security of the free world,
enhance professional development
of the staff, contribute to
international exchange of
scientific information, and
increase prestige and influence of
the Institute."*
Already in 1949 the Institute
had been urged by its directors to
move abroad. One of its first
projects in 1950 was an economic
survey of Cuba, undertaken for
the Cuban Government under the
auspices of the World Bank. From
1950 to 1955 over one hundred
members of the SRI staff travelled
abroad to work on 67 projects,
which ranged from assisting in
planning the industrialization of
Israel to an economic feasibility
study on the reopening of Pacific
purveyor service for Matson
Navigation Co.
SRI also began to move into
the two areas of the world which
have been the center of its efforts
ever since: the Pacific Basin and
Western Europe. About this time
an SRI director put the basis for
Institute expansion in these
terms: "the next decade will
surely bring many opportunities
for the advancement of free
enterprise around the
world . . . the move to further
internationalization of business is
unmistakable .... in its own
interests and in keeping with the
times, SRI should extend its
operations in a major way into the
international field."2
The growth in SRI
international activities culminated
in 1966 in the formation of a new
internal management entity.
"SRI-International," as part of a
plan to increase the Institute's
international operations from 15%
to 30% of the total. At present,
international activities account for
about one fifth of SRI'S total
business, divided among private
business (35%), public
development (20%) and military
projects (45%).
In a recent SRI-International
publication, its director made
clear his view of the Institute's
international purposes:
''SRI is dedicated to
these . . . two objectives:
economic progress, and the
strengthening of private
business on an international

scale. These are good and noble
causes and we are proud to
stand with international
companies the world over in
the pursuit of the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop
the private sector as the basic
factor in economic strength
and progress. "3
5. Financial History
The foregoing story of SRl's
growth and development is
reflected in and summarized by
the record of its financial
statements.
As the following table shows,
SRI achieved the transition from
substantial operating losses to
profitable operation in the early
1950'5, and its rate of growth
since then has been remarkable.
Project revenues have climbed
sharply, and so has accumulated
capital. The balance sheets and
operating statements for 1967 and
1968 (without accompanying
notes) follow the table, and give
the most current data.

111. THE
PRESENT
RELATIONSHIP
In evaluating the present
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI, it is necessary
to draw a clear distinction
between two sets of identifiable
data:
The first consists of the real or
perceived benefits (advantages)
and costs (disadvantages) flowing
from the existence of SRI.
The second consists of that
portion of the flow of benefits
and costs specifically attributable
to the present relationships and
existing arrangements between
SRI and the University.
A. The University's
Point of View
1. Benefits
The benefits which the
University enjoys from SRl's
existence fall into the following
categories:
a) The satisfaction and
prestige which the University
derives from having sponsored the
creation and growth of one of the
world's leading centers for applied
research.
b) The presence in the local
community of a large mass of
professional and technical talent
over and above that in the
Univesrity itself.
c) The availability of a broad
and well-organized outlet for
applied research interests of
faculty and graduate students.
d) Consulting opportunities for
individual faculty members who
desire to engage in such work.
e) Internship/Fellowship
opportunities for graduate
students.
112) The availability of qualified
SRI people for part-time and
specialized teaching in the
University itself.
These benefits do not depend
specifically on the present set of
relationships and arrangements
between the University and SRI.
Rather they flow from the
existence of SRI as a large and
viable institution and will
continue so long as SRI continues
to exist in the neighborhood.
2. Costs
Unlike the flow of benefits, the
real and perceived costs to the
University from its affiliation with
SRI flow primarily from the
existing set of arrangements
between SRI and the University.
In particular, the major kinds of
cost, or disadvantage, which are
listed below, stem from three
aspects of existing relationships.
These are:
First, the fact that the
University "owns" SRI and, in a
legal sense, is responsible for all of
its operations.
Second, the fact that as owner
the University makes no attempt
to derive regular revenues from
SRI.
Third, a widespread confusion
which exists in the mind of the
public, both here and abroad,
regarding the distinction between
the Institute and the University
proper. The present relationship is
an ambiguous one, and for many
people, SRI and the University
represent one and the same
institution and what is done by
one is frequently attributed to the
other.
The costs and disadvantages
which flow from the situation are
as follows:
a) The University's association
with SRI, through SRl's origin,
name and proximity, places the
University in the eyes of outsiders
in a position of responsibility.
Although the University has
chosen not to exercise much
control over the Institute's scope
and growth, it is held accountable
by the community and the public
for what SRI does. This situation
at times absorbs part of the
University's scarce administrative
and policy-making time and
talent. Increased control would
clearly absorb a far larger share of
the University's scarce
administrative and policy-making
time and energy.
b) Some of the war-related
activities in which SRI is
engaged—notably those dealing
with chemical-biological warfare
and c o un t e r in s u r gen c y
work —have exposed the
University to serious questioning
regarding its sense of mission, its
leadership, and its overall ethical
posture. Criticism on this score
ranges from outright
condemnation, at one extreme, of
the University's implied approval
of this form of research, to a more
widely ranging but milder
criticism of the University's
apparent involvement in research
which does not appear to be
appropriate to its basic function
or compatible with its own
announced research policies.
Opposition among students to the
present policies of SRI has
become more manifest. While SDS
has been the group most active in
attacking SRI, there are various
other groups also concerned about
the nature of some of SRI'S
research contracts. Any response
made by the University that
accommodates these concerns will
be viewed in Congress and by still
others as unwarranted yielding to
emotional pressure. In short, the
present situation is one that has
the potential of imposing
substantial political costs, from a
variety of directions, on the
University.
c) The confusion between the
identity of SRI and the identity
of the University itself can and
does lead to adverse publicity in
and out of scholarly circles
whenever SRI does work of
questionable quality. This is not
to suggest that SRl's performance
as a research institute is not of
high quality; there is considerable
evidence that some of it has been
excellent, and as far as these
achievements are concerned, the
University derives prestige from
what SRI does. However, the
quality of a significant part of SRI
activities has been questioned and
criticized. From faculty responses
to a questionnaire, this appears to
be more prevalent in the case of
social science and applied
management science work than of
work in the physical and
biological sciences. But whether
the result to the University of
outside attribution of SRl's work
and activities to it is credit or
discredit, it is unearned and
mistaken credit or discredit and
hard to justify.
d) Another, perhaps minor,

cost is the fact that SRI must
inevitably compete under the
Stanford name for support from
the same institutions and people
who might otherwise support
education and research in the
University proper. Workable
arrangements have been sought
between the Institute and the
University to minimize conflict
with respect to fund-raising. In
the field of obtaining research
grants from the federal
government, however, the Dean of
the School of Engineering pointed
out to the Committee that the
identification of" the two
institutions works to the
detriment of both.
e) A more serious disadvantage
on the financial front, which
flows from the existing set of
arrangements, is the large
"opportunity" cost of the funds
which the University legally and
technically owns, though it is not
accustomed to looking at it that
way, because of its ownership and
control of SRI. Whatever the
value of SRI is —and estimates
developed later range between
$20 million and $45 million—the
University itself derives no direct
financial return on it. SRl,since its
formation, has made total
payments to the University of
about $800,000, the bulk of it in
connection with the 1962-65
PACE campaign. Such
contributions ceased in 1967, and
have not been resumed.
Changing the arrangement
could bring the University large
financial benefits. For example, if
SRI were to be divested or sold,
the University could enjoy the
annual dividend and capital
appreciation it could derive by
reinvesting the proceeds from
such investment. Assuming a
"value" of $30 million for SRI
and an annual rate of return
including capital gains of around
10% on University endowment
investment, the present
arrangements may be viewed as
costing the University annual
revenues of $3 million. The
University's present endowment
income was $9Vi million in 1968.
B. SRl's Point of View
1. Benefits
From SRl's point of view,
University affiliation has clearly
been of tremendous value. It is
necessary to analyze the source
and scope of benefits and in doing
so to distinguish between past and
present as well as between the
legal and environmental ties from
which these benefits, in fact, flow.
a) The University name and tie
were both clearly important
during SRl's formative years; the
Institute's ability to attract staff,
customers, directors, grants and
loans were all enhanced. However,
today SRI generally stands in the
eyes of clients on the quality of
its own staff and what they
produce and the University
affiliation is now of only limited
value.
b) In spite of the Institute's
growth—and it is now a large and
mature or g a n i z a t i on — its
association with the University is
still cited as an important factor
in attracting high quality staff. In
this context, three separate
elements are frequently
mentioned:
i) The fact that SRI carried the
Stanford name gives the Institute
at least the appearance of being a
semi-academic institution, and
this appearance is presumably
attractive as a working
environment for some people.
ii) The fact that SRI is a
not-for-profit institution is
presumably a key factor for
others, primarily because it is
viewed as implying a considerable
degree of freedom for staff
members to pursue their own
goals and to be objective.
iii) A third element is simple
proximity to the University and
the set of informal relationships
to which proximity leads.
There is no easy way to

measure the relative importance
of these three subfactors. Of
them, only the first depends on
the existing legal relationship
between the University and SRI.
The second and third factors,
which are probably of greater
importance to potential staff
members than is the first factor,
are now both independent of
whatever legal ties might exist
between Stanford and the
Institute.
2. Costs
The present relationship with
the University also imposes some
costs or disadvantages on SRI.
a) The Institute has been
restricted in its efforts to obtain
endowment income and thereby
to support self-initiated research.
b) The second disadvantage of
the present relationship is that
SRI attracts greater criticism for
its activities because it is
sometimes regarded as part of the
University community proper.
c) A third disadvantage is that
the University and the University
board of Trustees are de jure
owners of the Institute. While de
facto control has been minimal,
the existence of latent veto and
control powers is a potentially
inhibiting one.
C. The Original Expectations
Another way of assessing the
Stanford-SRI relationship is to
examine, in the light of two
decades of operating history, the
original pro-and-con arguments
that led the University to sponsor
a research institute. These were
set forth in Part II in the
quotation on pages 4-5 from the
Swim - Swain-Leighton
memorandum.
1. The contribution of a
research institute to the
University's educational
functions.
In 1968, 53 (of the
approximately 1,000) members of
the Stanford faculty acted to
some extent as consultants to
SRI, and 14 SRI staff members
taught part-time at the University.
Some 67 Stanford students
worked at SRI in the Honors
Co-op Program.
2. The financial contribution
that a successful institute could
make to the University, by
supporting basic research or as a
source of income.
As noted, financial
contributions by SRI to the
University over a period of 22
years amount to a little over
$800,000. This includes payments
to specific departments and
programs.
So far as the indirect
consequences for University fund
raising are concerned, Vice
President for Finance Kenneth
Cuthbertson commented on this
in a communication to the
Committee as follows:
SRI on balance has been
neither a positive nor negative
factor in connection with
significant specific gifts from
others.
Whether or not SRI activites
have enhanced or detracted
from the climate for University
fund raising must remain a
matter of undocumented
judgment. My own belief is
that SRI has, on balance,
detracted slightly. My main
reason for this belief is that
SRI has functioned in activities
not usual to a university like
Stanford and essentially not
controlled by Stanford. When
SRI functioned well, any
positive reflection on the
University was likely to be
misplaced because the credit
really belonged to the
Institute. When SRI functioned
poorly (or was believed to have
functioned poorly), any
negative reflection on the
University could be sustained
at least to the extent that the
critic believed the University
negligent in not doing one of
two things: controlling the
Institute or getting rid of it.

o. Improved contacts between
the University and industry.
It seems reasonable to
conclude that these have resulted.
The benefits to the University
would presumably fall mainly in
either category 2 above or 4
below.
4. The Institute would provide
a means for the University to
attract and perform large scale
research contracts from
government and industry.
This has happened on occasion,
the most notable example being
the Center for Radar Astronomy.
But the great bulk of research
activity at both the University and
the Institute is unrelated. The
major factor which was
unanticipated at the time has been
the development of large support
by the federal government for
basic research activities at
universities. In 1968 Stanford
itself received about $76 million
for the conduct of sponsored
projects.
5. The University would be
given a leading part in the
industrial development of the
Pacific Coast.
The theme of regional
economic development that was
often stressed at the time of SRl's
formation is of little relevance to
the Institute as it has evolved
today. To the extent project
revenues can serve as a measure,
they show that less than 5% of
SRl's 1968 business was done
with firms headquartered in
California.
6. The divergence in primary
interest between a university and
a research institute serving its
clients.
This problem was noted at the
time, and it has continued to give
difficulty in the relations between
the two. It is commented on
further at a number of places in
this report.
7. The risk of financial failure
of the institute.
This was a very real and
constant concern to the
University in SRl's early years,
but that period is now long past.
There can be no question that SRI
has been an outstanding business
success, and in this respect the
judgment of its organizers has
been fully vindicated.
D. An Overview of the Present
Relationship
An analysis of the existing
relationship between tne
University and SRI and the way in
which it works in practice has led
the Committee to the firm
conclusion that the costs far
outweigh the benefits, certainly so
far as the University is concerned.
De jure responsibility without de
facto control seems to maximize
all of the disadvantages without
any corresponding increase in
benefits.
This is not to suggest that the
legal tie was not important or
even crucial, during SRl's
formative years. The relevant fact
is that this is no longer true. SRI
is now a mature institution in its
own right, which can make its
own way in a world in which
research has clearly come of age.
The history of the past twenty
years indicates the Institute's
overwhelming preference and
apparent need for de facto
independence.
For its part, the University has
its own primary mission to further
basic research and teaching. This
is a large enough task, and
requires a sense of purpose and
mode of operation which is
essentially different from the
methods of a more
action-oriented, problem-oriented,
market-oriented institution
engaged in applied contract
research.
Given these facts the present
relationship is an anomalous and
ambiguous one. We are unanimous
in recommending that it should
not be continued in its present
form.
There are two main lines of

alteration to be considered—the
Institute can be made completely
independent of the University, or
the ties between the two can be
made closer. These alternatives are
discussed by the members of the
Committee in the statements
which follow.
IV. MAJORITY
STATEMENT
A. Issues and Arguments
Altering the existing
relationship between the
University and the Institute can
take several forms. The principal
ones we have considered are:
a) Total assimilation of SRI
into the University: This
fundamental change would make
SRI an internal component ol the
University, subject to a single
centralized process of
decision-making with respect to
budget, staff and policies.
b) Less sweeping measures
aimed at making SRI more
responsive to University needs and
policies while preserving its
present status as a separate and
self-sufficient though wholly
owned subsidiary.
c) Divestment of SRI by the
University under various
assumptions regarding the status
of the successor organization.
.—Altering legal structure is a
means rather than an end in itself.
The ends include the resolution of
basic problems and
considerations. In this light, the
final selection of a revised set of
formal arrangements is simply a
conscious choice of the best or
optimal route for resolving the
major issues.
The University's present
investigation of SRl's relation to
the University has been
occasioned in large part by the
pressure exerted by students
expressing their concern about the
chemical-biological warfare work,
counterinsurgency work, and the
very direct involvement of SRI in
Vietnam war activities. We feel
that not only the more radical
students, but in fact, a wide
majority of the students and
faculty at the University are
extremely disturbed about the
University and SRl's role with
regard to this work. The Vietnam
conflict has, to be sure, divided
the country and the university
community. But precisely because
the country finds itself in a war
about which it is in doubt, it is
wholly inappropriate that an
educational institution should be
involved in it. In order to stop
such objectionable research and
prevent its future recurrence,
there has been a demand that the
University bring SRI under tighter
institutional control.
Two issues need to be clearly
distinguished—the moral issue and
the organizational relationship
issue. The moral issue deals with
SRl's undertaking of
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research and research that directly
supports the prosecution of the
war in Vietnam. The
organizational issue deals with the
question of what ought to be the
legal and working relationship
between Stanford and SRI. In the
eyes of the Committee, the
University has only two options
with regard to the question of the
organizational relationship—either
some form of sale or maintaining
SRI as a University adjunct. These
alternatives are described and
explored below. The moral issue
and the organizational
.-elationship issue are distinct and
separate. They deal with two
different problems, and the
decisions to be made on them are
determined by two different sets
of criteria. Both sets of criteria are
relevant.
1. The Moral Issue
Approximately $6Vfe million or
10% of SRl's total work is in
research in chemical-biological
warfare, counterinsurgency, or
work that directly supports the
war in Vietnam. It is our firm
opinion that much of this research
should not be carried on either at
the University or at a
University-affiliated research
institute. All components of such
morally objectionable research
should be phased out as soon as
possible; no new research projects
should be sponsored that are
clearly morally objectionable.
There must be a prohibition of
research in chemical-biological
warfare, of much work in
counterinsurgency and of much
work that supports the war in
Vietnam. But it needs to be
clearly stated that such a
prohibition on morally
objectionable research can be
prescribed and maintained
whether or not SRI is placed on
sale or maintained under
University control. The question
of the organizational relationship
does not depend in any way on
the moral question about
objectionable research.
If SRI is sold either to its
employees or to an outside buyer,
then explicitly stated restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be placed in the
conditions of sale or mortgage. At
the same time, an enforcement
procedure can also be defined
which will allow the University to
take action should there be any
recurrence of such research in the
future.
If, on the other hand, SRI is
maintained as a University
adjunct, then again restraints
prohibiting morally objectionable
research can be prescribed. A
procedure for monitoring the
research and for enforcing the
restraints can be established at the
same time.
In either the case of sale of SRI
or of retention of SRI as a
University adjunct, we need the
following:
1) clear restraints prohibiting
chemical-biological warfare
research, counterinsurgency
research, and research that
directly supports the war in
Vietnam; and
2) an influential and open
review committee or committees
selected from concerned and
competent individuals in society,
leaders from SRI, and from
faculty and students at the
University to review and advise
the President of the University or,
the research work that SRI i:
doing in these areas. Such a
committee should be set up
immediately and its hearings
should be conducted in an open
fashion so as to assure the whole
community that morally
objectionable research will stop
and not recur in the future.
We* arrive at these conclusions
after taking into account the fact
that there are arguments against
them. Many thoughtful members
of society find it difficult to make
moral distinctions between
different types of military
weaponry or research—between
chemical gases (which may be
lethal or non-lethal) and nuclear
missiles, for example, or between
contingency studies for Thailand
and contingency studies for
Berlin. While agreeing that much
of such research is inappropriate
at a university, because it contains
nothing of value for university
functions, these members feel this
is also true of much of SRl's
ordinary commercial work to
which no objection is raised. This
becomes merely another way of
saying that the University and the
Institute carry out markedly
different kinds of activities.
The important moral
questions, as these individuals see
it, lie not in the acquisition of
knowledge, but in the uses to
which it is put. Concern over the
former is both misdirected and
largely futile; concern over the
latter is of the essence of both
moral and political responsibility.
It is, if anything, hindered by
elevating SRl's conduct in
Thailand of a research project on
guerrilla detection to a central

position; the critical questions
relate to what U.S. policy in
Thailand is to be, and why.
2. 1 he Organization Issues
The organizational issues can
best be outlined by listing sets of
questions for which reasonable
answers must be found before
reasonable institutional
arrangements can be devised. The
sequence, dictated by expositional
convenience rather than their
importance, is as follows:
a) The Form of SRI. If the
present form of SRI is to be
altered, what form should the
"'successor" organization have?
Should it be essentially an
independent and autonomous
institution or should it be
essentially a subsidiary of
Stanford or of any other
corporation? In either situation
should it continue as a
not-for-profit institution or
should it be converted into a
for-profit research company?
Finally, whether it is drawn into
or divested from the University
should it retain the present
Stanford name or should its name
be changed to something less
likely to be confused with the
remainder of the University?
b) The Scope of SRI Research
Work. How should the proper
scope and thrust of SRl's future
research efforts be guided? What
should be the balance between ad
hoc responses to short-run market
demands for services from either
government or industry and
planned responses to potential
and foreseeable but harder to
fund "needs?" Does the present
composition of capability and
output satisfy the intent of the
University, or should some
components be excised and others
deliberately expanded?
c) The Question of Primary
Mission. To what extent do the
primary missions of SRI and the
University overlap? To what
extent do they differ? Can the
sectors of overlap be conjoined to
produce significantly better
results for both institutions and
society under one form of
relationship than another? Do
these potential benefits outweigh
the potential costs of uniting their
disparate sectors under the same
form of relationship?
d) The Division of
Discretionary Funds. How should
SRI and the University divide the
flow of residual discretionary
revenue which SRI now generates
and might generate in the future?
Through a common pool to be
reinvested in developing and/or
disseminating new knowledge? On
the basis of a 50-50 sharing
between two separate decision
centers? On the present basis of a
100% share of discretion on
reinvestment lodged solely with
SRI? On some other basis?
Even if each of these questions
had only two possible answers
apiece the number of different
responses to the entire set of
questions is clearly very large, and
certainly large enough to court
individual minority positions for
almost any committee of
manageable size. Nonetheless the
entire issue of the "optimal" legal
form of relationship to be selected
for the future presupposes that
each of these questions has been
answered correctly. This, neither
we, nor anybody, has the insight
and wisdom to guarantee. What
we can assert is that the answers
to these questions are relevant to
any organizational solution —and
hence that they must be
examined.
Take for example the issue of
excising some portion of SRl's
present activity, on the grounds
that it is morally inappropriate.
Two reasonable people, both of
whom believe that a given
definable 10% of present activity
should be excised might
nonetheless arrive at different
conclusions regarding the issue of
divestment vs. a closer drawing-in
of the Institute. On the other
hand two people who hold

radically different veiws about the
fraction to be excised —for
example 1% vs. 50%—may
nonetheless agree that the
appropriate form of organization
is integration within the
University. In this situation mere
agreement on the preferred form
of SRl's future organization does
not necessarily imply underlying
agreement on basic issues.
Likewise, disagreement on
organizational form may blur a
deeper fundamental agreement on
the issue itself.
3. Questions of "Form"
and Scope
Many people in the University
as well as staff members of SRI
see its present non-profit status as
being important, if not essential.
In this view, the non-profit status
can contribute importantly to the
quality and objectivity of SRl's
work and hence to its social value.

The same is true of SRl's
autonomy (which it has largely
possessed to date in spite of the
machinery of legal control vested
in the University Board of
Trustees). The argument for
independence runs along the same
lines as the arguments for
non-profit status. Many of the
most highly qualified and valuable
professional staff at SRI choose in
effect to take part of their overall
compensation in the form of a
degree of self-selection in research
projects and opportunities for
unsponsored research. Conversion
of SRI to a for-profit institution,
especially as a subsidiary, may
cause some such people to decide
to leave.
But perceived staff preferences
are not the only dimension of the
for-profit vs. not-for-profit issue.
At present SRI devotes about a
fifth of its effort to what might be
labeled "projective planning
research" both in the field of
technology and in socio-economic
areas. This aspect of their work
probably represents their most
creative contribution to long-run
technological and social problems.
This type of research requires
expenditure of funds with very
risky outcomes. Because of this
level of risk, this research is in
large part back-stopped by the
remainder of the activity, which
necessarily tends to be both more
short-term and more economically
lucrative than the projective
planning aspects. If SRI were to
be converted to a profit making
institution the result would
inevitably be a sharp decrease in,
if not the subsequent loss of, the
projective planning aspects of
their work—primarily because
these aspects are hard to finance
and also because there is no sector
of the society including
government itself which is at
present ready to support such
activity totally on its own. It is
also clear that various government
agencies actively seek non-profit
organizations to do work that will
facilitate social and economic
innovations. A move to a profit
status would eliminate an
important emerging area of
development.
On the scope of SRl's work,
the previous section has already
dealt directly with the question of
the need to define and excise
those segments of its present work
which are immoral or
inappropriate. But the scope also
has a positive dimension: this is
the need, in restructuring or
reorganizing the Institute, to find
that form of organization which
will encourage and indeed press
the Institute into the performance
of longer-run research goals and

tasks as opposed to more
short-run consulting type
solutions to narrower needs.
One issue which is clearly
central to the question of optimal
organizational relationship
between the two institutions is
the degree to which the two have
common or complementary
purposes and modes of operation.
The traditional view is that the
primary function of the
University is education and basic
research. In contrast the primary
function of SRI is applied and
exploratory-applied research. In
this view the University's sense of
purpose and mode of operation
must be essentially different from
the purpose and methods of the
more a c t i on - or ie nt e d ,
problem - oriented and
market-oriented institution which
is engaged primarily in applied
contract work. The relatively
small areas of overlap and
commonality between these two
kinds of institutions can and
should be fostered to the greatest
possible advantage of both, but
these common areas represent so
small a part of either basic mission
that their consideration should
not dominate the selection of the
overall organizational tie.
However it is possible to hold a
different set of views about the
nature of the two institutions. For
example, if the University's
primary function is redefined in
ways that assign a much higher
priority to its role as an active
agent of direct social change with
correspondingly smaller roles for
its traditional functions of
teaching and research, and if at
the same time the primary mission
of SRI is redefined as a necessary
component of such a University,
one can be led to very different
conclusions regarding optimal
interorganizational arrangements.
This view assumes that an
organization as complex as
Stanford can in fact shift its
function as radically as this view
would demand.
The final issue at the
organizational level concerns the
appropriate distribution of
discretionary funds generated by
SRl's activities. If we assume that
these activities or the bulk of
them continue along present lines,
the future flow of discretionary
investable funds would be $3 to
$4 million a year. When SRI was
originally formed it was envisaged
that 50% of net income would be
turned over to the University for
its own preferred uses. In fact,
apart from a contribution to the
Stanford PACE program, this has
not occurred. Instead, SRI has
used its discretionary fund flows
■nternally. The future division of
such funds is an issue, regardless
of whether SRI is drawn closer
into the University or whether it
is divested. The major difference
is that under divestment, the
potential value of such funds is
capitalized into an explicit
number; specific arrangements are
made for a specific transfer from
the Institute to the University;
and the University ceases to carry
the responsibility for meeting
future losses which SRI might
suffer in any given period. In
short, with divestment the
University can expect some
positive flow of revenues. In
contrast, if SRI is drawn into the
University, the expected flow of
monies could be either positive or
negative.
B. Closer Integration
1. Assimilation into University
There is obvious appeal
inherent in the notion of uniting
SRI and the University for the
purpose of increasing the capacity
of both to advance human
welfare. What is less obvious, but
formidably real, are the
difficulties and disadvantages
involved. It is eloquent testimony
to the reality of these drawbacks
that no member of the Committee
is of the opinion that an
integration of Stanford and SRI
should be seriously considered.

Given the Committee's unanimity
on this point, the matter of
complete integration need not be
discussed at length; but since
many members of the community
have not had the opportunity of
giving close consideration to the
question, some brief attempt to
outline the reasons for our
conclusion is desirable.
First, the sheer size of SRI is a
factor of some moment. To
integrate the Institute with the
University would expand the
latter's payroll by more than
3,000 persons, or 35%. For
example, SRl's present
administration includes ten vice
presidents. The administrative
structure of the joint enterprise
after integration might not
include all these persons at the
same rank, but it would certainly
have to be greatly enlarged over
the present University
administration. This is the more
true because SRl's activities
require more administrative
personnel in proportion to volume
than do the University's. SRI is
far closer to the business world in
its needs and procedures than is
the University; it must be ready to
respond rapidly and effectively to
a wide variety of requests for
service originating outside the
Institute. An industrial firm or a
governmental unit often wants
prompt action on a piece of
applied research, without which it
finds that some important
commercial or governmental
project cannot be carried out.
Personnel and facilities must then
be quickly mobilized to respond.
University research, on the other
hand, almost always originates
with the individual faculty
member, or a small group of
faculty members. Typically, it
does not involve an intricate or
urgent set of deadlines; being for
the most part "basic" rather than
"applied" (or at least tending in
that direction), it partakes far less
of the character of a job done for
a customer, even when it is
sponsored by agencies outside the
University, than does most SRI
project research. University
Research Administration is a
correspondingly lean office,
containing only 9 people,
including secretaries.
It involves no denigration of
SRI to assert that the Institute, in
contrast to the University, has no
significant educational mission.
SRI is organized to provide
contract research for clients, and
this function simply does not
blend smoothly with that of a
university. The practical impact of
that difference was made
admirably clear to the Committee
by the testimony of Professor Carl
B. Spaeth, Chairman of the
Committee on International
Studies in the University.
Describing how requests for
"social service" research and
training programs come to the
University in numbers far
exceeding Stanford's capacity to
respond, he pointed to the
necessary steps that must be
taken, each time such a proposal
is undertaken, in order to protect
the University's educational
function. If faculty are to be
taken from the University campus
for on-site research elsewhere,
provision must be made so that
the University's teaching can be
carried on. The result is
"overstaffing": the University
employs two or more persons in
the same specialty so that one can
be away on applied research
without leaving the field vacant
on campus. But this is expensive,
prohibitively so in most instances;
the agency, whether a business, a
foundation, or a branch of
government, cannot afford to
support incremental academic
appointments in order to get
accomplished a piece of research
that may be expected to take but
a limited number of months
overall. SRI is not and could not
be hampered by such constraints,
without suffering a disastrous loss

♦Mr. Nivison, who joins the
signers of this part of the report,
is neutral on this issue. He believes
that whatever is done should
accord with the wishes of the
academic community.
of research volume.
There is the further point that
research projects in the University
are generally not approved unless
they involve Stanford students,
and thereby contribute directly to
the educational process. Most SRI
projects would not be adaptable
to this requirement; the research
is often of the strongly applied
kind, containing few areas of
investigation susceptible to
treatment by graduate students.
SRl's response to a customer must
be quick; he wishes to buy the
services of the Institute, and will
take his business elsewhere if he
must wait while a survey is
conducted to determine whether,
by ingenuity, an educational
component can be worked out
satisfactorily from the University
viewpoint.
Other practical difficulties
abound. The situation regarding
overhead costs at SRI is markedly
different from that of the
University. Universities seldom if
ever obtain a full return of their
costs in undertaking research.
Were a non-profit research
institute to operate this way it
would soon go out of business.
(The use of a commercial
metaphor is all but unavoidable,
which merely clarifies the contrast
in the two situations.) Personnel
policies are also markedly
different, as are salary scales.
Appointment procedures are quite
unlike, as are provisions for
dismissal.
Finally, integration would
almost inevitably come to
produce an increased competition
for University resources. This is
worth stressing, since the
expectation is sometimes voiced
that assimilation of SRI would
bring an augmentation of
resources to Stanford. As Mr.
Kenneth Cuthbertson, Vice
President for Finance, put it in a
communication to the
Committee:
"First, although I am not
aware he has yet stated it,
Professor Parkinson might add
to his laws that 'In a
high-quality university, each
major activity can justify for
its own expenditure at least
that amount of income
attributable to it.' I firmly
believe that if the SRI activity
were to live in healthy
interrelationship with other
University activities it would
soon require more than its own
income. A university like
Stanford is committed to
improving the quality of all its
undertakings and presumably
this same commitment would
apply to SRI-type functions;
indeed, the professional staff
of the Institute and the faculty
of the University could not
otherwise work together with
the required mutual respect. I
am not assuming that the
quality weaknesses of SRI are
any greater than those of the
University; I am assuming that
recognizable inadequacies exist
in both. I don't believe we
could perpetuate the
inadequacies of one (SRI) in
order to overcome those of the
other (University)—particularly
when the former could point
to its 'own' income available
for seeking improvement."
In the Committee's view, this
analysis is if anything confirmed
by the Carnegie-Mellon case, to
the extent we have information
on it. This is the one example of a
merger at all analogous to a
joining of Stanford with SRI. It
involved the linking of Carnegie
Institute of Technology with the
Mellon Institute, to form the
Carnegie-Mellon University. The
differences between the Mellon
Institute before the merger and
SRI today are striking, however.
The Mellon Institute had an
educational mission from its
inception; training of research
workers was among it purposes
from the start, and it had for
years collaborated with nearby

universities in the training of
advanced degree candidates.
Mellon was far smaller than SRI;
the total professional staff at
Mellon was about 200, compared
to 1,512 at SRI (as of December,
1968). Mellon's industry
sponsored research had been
decreasing for years before the
merger; in 1957 the Mellon Board
of Trustees "announced plans for
Mellon Institute which called for a
major expansion of fundamental
research and set, as a matter of
policy, the goal of essentially
equal effort in independent (i.e.,
non-sponsored) fundamental
(basic, as distinct from applied)
research and in sponsored
industrial research.'
Industry-sponsored research
projects at Mellon dropped from
more than fiftv in 1955 to twelve
in 1967. The Report explains:
"This decline in the number of
fellowships (the Mellon Institute
term for sponsored projects) may
be due to a lessened demand for
the Institute's services as more
industries have established their
own research centers, or to the
growth of other institutes offering
specific problem solving staff and
facilities. Examples of the latter
include Battelle Memorial
Institute, Stanford Research
Institute, Midwest Research
Institute, and Illinois Institute of
Technology Research Institute."2
Also significant in the Mellon
emphasis upon basic research was
the fact of generous endowments,
including $12 million book value
"original endowment fund" and
$19 million book value in the
"Fundamental Research Trust."3
Possession of such endowments,
wholly lacking at SRI, obviously
made it possible for Mellon
Institute to simulate far more
closely than does SRI the
purposes and functions of
University research.
In short, the Mellon Institute
before its merger with Carnegie
Tech was already a much more
university-like organization than is
SRI; its research emphases, its
funding, its size all made
amalgamation relatively simple
and effective. In contrast, so
different are the purposes and
functioning of most SRI research
undertakings and most University
research projects that, no matter
what form of integration might be
attempted on paper, the facts
would have to belie the form.
Two quite separate enterprises
would continue to exist, or one
would be changed to the point of
destruction.
2. University Adjunct
Even if absorption of SRI into
the University seems neither
feasible nor rewarding, it is still
necessary to consider whether an
assortment of lesser changes might
remove many of the present
objections and enhance the utility
to the University of continuing
SRl's status as a separate
subsidiary. One argument for
maintaining SRl's present status is
as follows: As a not-for-profit
research institute, SRI is not
subject to many of the constraints
which a business corporation
faces. Because of its status, a
not-for-profit research institute
can sponsor exploratory
research, research which is not
heavily tied to the constraints and
values of the market-place.
Included here, for example, is
research for which there are few
buyers, but which is nevertheless
valuable, e.g., educational policy
research, or research which is free
of the bias induced by
marketplace competition, e.g., a
"neutral" feasibility study for
government on a weapons system,
which could not be obtained from
one of the defense contractors. It
is this kind of exploratory
research in technical-applied fields
which is not heavily sponsored by
either universities or industry, but
which is the special potential of
the not-for-profit research
institute.

1 Report of the Joint Trustee-Staff

Committee on University Policy
for Sponsored Research, Sept. 5,
1968, Carnegie-Mellon University,
pp. 6-7. 2lbid., p. 7. 3Progress
Report on Planning for the Merger
of Mellon Institute and Carnegie
Institute of Technology, Jan. 16,
1967, p. 8.

A second argument for
maintaining SRI as a University
adjunct (but with separate
identity) stems from the fact that
the University is now under
pressure to apply the knowledge,
understanding and judgment
which many' believe constitutes
the University's special resource
to social-urban problems. But to
reshape the University as a social
problem-solving institution would
detract from its primary
education and basic research
function. Little evidence is
available to suggest that this type
of transformation is even possible.
The University could perform
both these functions while
avoiding the kind of drastic
reorganization suggested above,
by maintaining SRI as a separate
institution devoted to the solution
of social-urban problems on the
one hand, and by keeping the
University purely for the
educational and basic research
function. A clear implication of
this line of thought is that the
University would exercise much
closer guidance over the direction
of SRI policy. And other
implications flow from this one.
Just as the University attempts
to protect the academic freedom
of the individual scholar, so also
the not-for-profit research
institute needs to protect the
freedom of the individual
researcher or research team. In
operational terms, the means that
decision-making on what projects
are to be accepted must be
"bottom-up," that individual
research teams must not be under
heavy financial pressure to
maintain a constant flow of new
contracts, and that the individual
researcher must be free to
question the ideological
assumptions implicit in the
requests of clients. Without
"bottom-up" decision-making,
researchers would leave and go
elsewhere. Without freedom from
financial pressure, project
managers are more likely to take
on contracts that are undesirable,
unethical or beyond capability.
Without freedom to question
ideological assumptions, the
resarch project may be turned to
nefarious uses.
On the other hand, just as
there are limits to academic
freedom in the University, there
need to be limits on the freedom
of research within its research
adjunct. SRl's work would have
to be open to scrutiny to ensure
that it is competent, that it is
within moral limits, and that it is
of optimum social value. In
general terms, this means that the
University would exercise a
greater degree of control over SRI
affairs, without of course
infringing upon the freedom of
individual researchers and research
teams, except when there is
evidence to believe that certain
research is either incompetent,
beyond moral limits, or not of
optimum social value.
Institutional means through
which the University could
influence SRI policy would have
to be developed and manned. One
possible means of doing this
would be to establish a new office
of Vice-President for SRI, an
advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI, and a set
of guidelines for SRI.
The Vice-President for SRI
would act as the President's
representative to SRI, perhaps
even assuming the chairmanship
of the Board of Directors of SRI.
The advisory committee to the
Vice-President for SRI would
draw its membership from SRI,
Stanford University, and
competent persons from society

at large. It would function as a
liaison between these various
communities.
This advisory committee
together with the Board of
Directors would generate
guidelines for the conduct of SRI
affairs. Specifically the function
of these guidelines would be as
follows:
(a) to do projective planning
for SRI as a whole, including the
determination of the composition
of research
(b) to monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research, and
(c) to ensure that SRI research
is within moral limits and is of
optimum social value.
The technical quality of the staff
could best be monitored through
a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research, its moral
acceptability, and its social value
may perhaps best be monitored
through low-level review
committees. Such review
committees could be set up within
the SRI administrative framework
but should draw some of their
members from outside SRI; some
clarification would be required
to determine when a piece of
research should be brought
forward for review.
One of the functions of the
guidelines would be to prevent
objectionable and undesirable
research from being carried on at
SRI. Three types of research
could be identified as undesirable:
(a) Work that could well lead
to projects whose high cost would
prevent the attainment of other
goals regarded as socially more
desirable in the eyes of the
Institute (e.g., the ABM system);
(b) Work that might lead to the
construction of military weapons
that offend basic moral principles
set out in such forms as the
Geneva conventions (e.g.,
chemical-biological weapons);
(c) Work that interferes
fundamentally with the natural
political development of overseas
countries (e.g., counterinsurgency
in Thailand).
In the eyes of many people this
kind of research should not be
carried on at a research institute
associated with a University; for
some, this kind of research should
not be done at all.
Over time, the composition of
research at SRI would change in
certain directions. Specifically,
given the concerns of many of the
Stanford community, there
should be less research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, Southeast
Asia; more research in
social-urban problems; and more
exploratory research.
But changing the composition
of research could not be
accomplished immediately or
without cost. Present contract
obligations would have to be
fulfilled. Personnel on projects
being phased out would have to
be transferred to other projects or
released. Personnel and funds
would have to be found to build
research division in new areas. All
of this might well take several
years before there is significant
change in the overall character of
research at SRI. If too large a
switch were made at once (e.g.,
more than 10%) it is probable that
the flow of discretionary funds
which SRI now generates could
vanish. Indeed, under those
arrangements SRI may not "earn"
enough to cover its own expenses.
Such deficits would have to be
met either indirectly from gifts or
within the University's budget.
The case against SRI as a
semi-integrated adjunct is that
virtually all of its alleged benefits
can be obtained at far lower risk
and cost to the University under
other arrangements. For example,
most of the arguments made for
the adjunct idea are really
arguments in favor of the
existence of non-profit research
organizations and research

organizations which are
independent of manufacturing
firms (characteristics which are
not necessarily related).
The important issue here is the
altogether separate question of
why such an organization should
be operated by Stanford
University. In effect, it seems to
be urged that technical-applied
exploratory research is so valuable
to society or some part thereof,
though not to buyers of research
(who are unwilling to pay for it),
that the University as owner of
SRI should be content with a
minimal or zero return, and
indeed expose itself to possible
deficits, in order to permit (or
require) SRI to provide more
in-ho use sponsored projects.
Whatever the merits of such an
argument, it is certainly not
drawn in terms of advancing the
interests of the University or
promoting basic research on
contemporary social problems. It
would amount to a University
subsidization of applied research
of all types, in the hope of getting
as a fringe benefit some useful
work in certain areas which
compose a small fraction of SRl's
total activities.
Even the intended alteration in
the nature and composition of
SRI research may be far easier to
describe than achieve. SRI is
today a large and complex
enterprise which has taken form
and acquired personnel and
facilities in response to client
rather than University needs and
desires. To attempt to reorient
more than ten percent or so of its
activities and business and policies
would require substantial
investments of time and talent by
University administration and
faculty, as the apparatus of
guidelines and advisory
committees and review
committees recognizes. Both the
ultimate success and the net
advantage of such efforts are far
from clear.
In sum, the considerations
discussed in Subsection 1 are to a
large extent applicable here as
well. SRI is engaged in a form of
business of proven value and high
technical skills, but one which has
only limited overlap with
University activities, as
demonstrated by the slight extent
of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts
to involve the two more closely
would probably work to the
detriment of each.
Such are some of the
arguments. Here we point out
again that the choice for or
against retention need not be a
choice of ends. There could well
be agreement that Stanford
University, directly or through its
agents, should be doing certain
things and should not be doing
others, and yet no agreement
about the legal relationship of SRI
to the University is realizing these
ends.
C. Divestment
The other direction to which
the Committee turned in its
exploration of the alternatives
available to the University was an
assessment of different
possibilities in effecting a
divestiture of SRI from the
University.
The history of the relationship
between the University and SRI,
and the problems to which it has
given rise, indicate that the two
institutions do not have enough
by way of common purpose and
program to warrant any form of
joint operation. This is not to cast
aspersions on the personnel of
SRI or relegate the Institute to
some form of inferior intellectual
or moral status; it is simply to
face squarely the differences in
function that exist and their
implications.
Integration of SRI into the
University could eliminate the
existing ambiguity, but only at
the cost of radically altering the
Institute's scope and mode of
operation —a change which would
impose serious financial and
administrative burdens on
Stanford. In contrast, divestiture
would ensure an orderly
continuation of the Institute's
strength and most of its preferred
activity. In addition, it could add
substantially to the University's
financial resources. But
divestment is not a
one-dimensional process. It
encompasses several major
variables. Two major variables
which we have discussed at length
in Sections A and B are (a) the
moral issue of restraints and
guidelines, and (b) the functional
issues of organizational form.
These are common to both forms
of suggested future organization.
1. The Question
of SRl's Value
Divestment raises a third issue.
This is the questioof the "value"
which Stanford, as SRl's present
owner, should realistically place
on the Institute. At one extreme
the University could simply sever
existing legal ties and claim no
financial recoupment in exchange.
The issue of "free severance" is
one of the rare proposals on
which the committee voted
unanimously. The vote was "No."
The Institute came into existence
through Stanford's initiative and
assistance and it required
considerable financial resources
and exposure to financial and
non-financial risks for a long
period of time. It is now a
material asset of the University
and the University's need today is
too great and too sobering to
permit any course of action that
would not turn this asset to
account.
This leaves the question of how
much value the University should
rightfully claim. An exact answer
to this question is difficult, partly
because of the nature of SRl's
assets—which are not typical—but
more importantly because the
question of realizable value is not
entirely a financial one. It
depends on how the important
variables relevant to divestment
are interpreted and treated.
All of these variables associated
with the mode of divestment are
clearly interrelated in complex
ways. For example, SRl's "value"
depends in part on whether it is
continued as an independent
institute or becomes an operating
subsidiary of another corporation.
Its value also depends in part on
whether it is continued on a
not-for-profit basis or converted
into a normal for-profit
corporation. Finally, SRl's value
depends in part on the extent to
which the University, as divestor,
imposes research restrictions on
the purchaser or in the Institute's
new charter as a condition of sale
or divestment.
Some of the relationships are
difficult to predict, even as to
direction. For example, earnings
after taxes would be affected by
sale and conversion from a
not-for-profit operation into a
for-profit operation. On the one
hand, the Institute would pay
federal income taxes on all of its
net income instead of as at
present, only a portion. On the
other hand, while the Institute
already has to and does operate at
a "profit," it is not now a
profit-maximizing organization. If
it were converted to a for-profit
business enterprise there would
presumably be added incentive for
controlling costs and enhancing
income. In addition, the Institute
would be relieved of certain
limitations that now pertain under
its present non-profit status.
Similarly it is difficult to place
any value equivalent on the
preference which many SRI staff
members place on the
not-for-profit status.
Within these limitations, it is
nonetheless useful to analyze the
three major variables outlined
above in order to arrive at an
approximately optimal mix of

divestment conditions.
2. Estimates of
Realizable Proceeds
Given the complications listed
above, it is not possible, without
the helo of professional financial
opinion, to set a definite number
on SRl's value for each set of
divestment conditions. What can
be done is to estimate a range of
values for each subset of
underlying assumptions.
A complicating issue is the
question of the University's claim
or lack of claim to the past capital
contributions outsiders have made
to the Institute. The only way to
approach this factor is to
distinguish between "gross" and
"net" value —with the difference
representing the aggregate amount
of capital contributions SRI has
received to date. Since the total of
these contributions as of the end
of December 1968 from a variety
of sources (including the U.S.
Government in some major HEW
grants) amounts to approximately
$5.5 million, the difference
between gross and net values as
shown in the analysis below
represents a hypothetical refund
of these capital contributions
either to those who provided the
funds or to the Institute itself. No
doubt such a refund is not likely
to occur not be legally required,
but it affords an analytical
method of taking such outside
contributions into account.
a) Outside sale to another
business corporation as a
non-profit, dependent
subsidiary. Sale under these
conditions is likely to yield the
highest flow of dollars to the
University, but there is no single
formula for value even under
these fairly straightforward
assumptions. What we have are
several "rules of thumb," with the
exact figure being determined to a
large extent by the availability
and nature of interested buyers.
Among several ways of arriving
at a first estimate of possible sale
value, the following are
commonly used:
i) A common yardstick for a
maximum first estimate is "one
dollar of market value per dollar
of annual sales" for rapidly
growing institutions engaged in
the kind of technological activity
which SRI performs. A more
conservative basis for estimating
market value in this way is to
estimate the value as equal to
approximately 70c per dollar of
annual sales. Since SRl's sales are
in the $60-65 million range, this
approach would give a value of
$40-45 million for the Institute
on a gross basis.
ii) An alternative basis would
use SRl's recent earnings
performance and the
price/earnings ratios of
technically-based, fast-growing
firms which are large contractors
to the government. Applying such
a price/earnings ratio of 20 to 1 to
SRl's average after-tax earnings
for the most recent two-year
period gives a market value
estimate of approximately $33
million (again on a gross basis).
iii) A rock-bottom estimate
for the value of SRI would simply
take the book-value of its capital
account. As of the end of 1968
this was in excess of $24 million.
The gross market value of SRI,
as far as outright unconditional
sale is concerned, probably lies
somewhere between a low of $25
million at one extreme and a high
of $45 million at the other. Both
these figures are on a gross basis.
On a net basis, allowing for a
refund of capital contributions
received by SRI from
non-University sources, the net
proceeds from outright sale would
be somewhere between $20 and
$40 million.
Sale of SRI to its own
employees and others and its
continuation as an independent
but for-profit corporation.
This represents a second major
form which divertiture might

take. The realizable value on this
basis is likely to lie toward the
lower end of the value ranges
indicated above. In order for such
a transaction to be feasible, it
would probably be necessary to
arrange for several classes of
securities to be issued. For
example, it is possible to envisage
a special class of securities to be
acquired by SRl's pension and
annuity fund; a second class of
interest-bearing debentures to be
acquired by those employees who
prefer this form of participation;
and a third class of straight
common stock issues which might
be purchased by some employees
and directors of SRI with an
unsold residue being held
temporarily in the University's
own endowment fund or sold to
the public.
c) A third major form of
divestiture would be one which
preserves not just the
independence of the Institute but
also its non-profit status.
In exchange for divestiture the
University would accept mortgage
or debenture bonds to be issued
by SRI in an agreed upon amount,
with the debentures being retired,
with an appropriate rate of
interest, over an agreed upon
period such as 20-25 years. For
purposes of illustration, assume
that a rock-bottom net value of
$21 million is set on the value of
the University's equity interest in
SRI. The University would in
effect make a long-term loan to
the Institute in this amount. At an
assumed interest rate of 7% per
annum, this could be retired in
twenty annual installments of
approximately $2 million each.
For larger or small values, the
corresponding annual payment on
a 7%, 20-year basis would be
proportionately larger or smaller.
Although the timing and
aggregate amount recoverable
under the third approach to
divestiture would be the lowest,
the approach would preserve
virtually all of the benefits which
it is claimed now accrue to SRI,
the community, and to society
from SRI'S status as an
independent not-for-profit
corporation. The existence and
value of such benefits would, of
course, have to be carefully
determined in reaching such a
decision.
3. The Cornell-CAL Case
The Committee studied the
recent precedent of a sale of a
university-affiliated research
institute. The Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory, like
SRI, was a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Cornell University,
and over the years operated as a
virtually autonomous unit
independent of the university,
despite the fact that the Board of
Trustees of CAL with three
exceptions was drawn from the
faculty, administration, and Board
of Trustees of Cornell. Following
studies of the relationships of
CAL and the university by
separate committees of the
faculty and administration, the
university's Board of Trustees
appointed its own committe*.
which, by a large majority,
recommended in December 1967
that the university and CAL
should be separated. In January,
the Board of Trustees approved
the committee's report and the
university employed a
management-consulting firm,
McKinsey and Company, to
appraise the value of CAL, to
explore the problems and
possibilities of sale, and to discuss
with interested parties the
purchase of CAL. On September
17, 1968, the Board accepted a
letter of intent from EDP
Technology, Inc., to purchase
CAL.
According to reports in
financial journals and business
magazines, the university received
a number of offers for CAL,
which was about half the size of
SRI in terms of both number of

employees (1500) and volume of
annual business ($32 million). The
employees of CAL sought to
purchase it for about $13 million
and expected to maintain it as a
non-profit enterprise. The
goverment of the State of New
York, wanting to keep CAL from
going to private industry and to
assure it would continue
operations in New York, offered a
price equivalent to slightly more
than $12 million ($9.6 million in
cash, plus mortgage and tax
considerations). EDP Technology,
a privately-owned computer
softwave comapny, offered $25
million, one-quarter of which was
in convertible debentures.
In explaining the decision of
the university's trustees, a
spokesman explained that they
had been guided by two
considerations: "to obtain as
favorable a financial return as
possible" and to continue the
function of the laboratory. Partly
because the state's offer was less
than half the price offered by
EDP, it was unacceptable. In
addition, he explained, there was
a feeling that the shift from a
non-profit to a profit-making
institution "may be superior in
carrying out the lab's mission." A
profit-making institution, for
example, might be able to secure
greater financial support.
The decision was not received
without opposition, however.
Considerable discontent amongst
the staff about the change in
status has been reported. The
president of CAL was removed,
the board of directors of the
laboratory was reconstituted, and
the state attorney general filed
suit to prevent the sale,
apparently on the grounds that it
would violate the terms of a
charitable trust under which the
laboratory had originally been
received or to which it had been
dedicated. (Cornell acquired the
laboratory in 1945 as a gift from
an aircraft manufacturer,
Curtiss-Wright Corporation.) At
present, consummation of the sale
is restrained pending trial of the
action on the merits.
The CAL case is in important
ways unlike the problem of SRI.
But it's history shows the need for
prudence in choosing and
executing the mode of sale.
D. Conclusion and
Recommendation
We come now to the overall
choice between the two major
avenues of organizational change
we have considered in depth—the
choice between closer integration
of SRI into the University on the
one hand and divestment on the
other.
There is powerful appeal, for
many, in the idea of retaining the
Institute and making of it the
University's instrument for
transforming society. They are
angry—not unreasonably—with
much of what they see in the
world, and they see our
universities as part of a total
"system," producing the world's
evil, conniving at it, and
acquiescing in it. By entering the
university with its
knowledge-orientation they seem
to themselves to be participating
in a sinister evasion. Here, in the
opportunity to strike off one of
the tentacles of the "system" and
turn it to right uses, could be a
way to change the university they
both need and condemn—a way,
for themselves, out of guilt and
back to action.
But to perform either an
educational function or a social
one the university must survive
and remain strong. And it is just
here that we see the decisive case
against retaining and changing the
Institute and in favor of selling it.
Let us suppose that there is a
''university community"
sufficiently of one mind to run
the Institute without bitter and
continued dissension. Still, if
retention and university control is
to be significantly different from

the present arrangement it must
approach more and more closely
to complete assimilation. As the
Institute discontinues more and
more lines of work that bring
income, its profit margin will
disappear. And as it moves more
and more into socially significant
research—of the kind that
typically brings no income, and
that must be funded by grants, if
grants can be found—there will be
a growing threat of deficits.
Obviously, the expectable
deficit will be larger the more
sweeping one's program of
reform. Mere phasing-out of CBW
and strictly defined
"counter-insurgency" would
probably not cut profit margins
significantly. Elimination of all
defense-related research might be
accomplished without loss if
undertaken very slowly —say over
ten or fifteen years—while
contract research for industry is
pressed with increasing vigor. But
a straight application of university
research policy to the
Institute —including the
university's policies on classified
research—would make this
impossible. And more enthusiastic
critics of the Institute openly
demand that all of its work be
shifted from defense and industry,
to projects that are socially
"relevant."
Such a switch in the content of
SRl's activity would clearly entail
a correspondingly large
elimination of staff members now
associated with these activities.
Even the most callous approach to
reducing expenses (mainly staff
salaries) in line with the reduction
in revenues, could not prevent the
Institute from swinging into a
heavy deficit position.
Stanford would have to
shoulder these deficits, for it
would be not just legal owner but
the author of policies—and this
must entail full responsibility.
Stanford this year has a projected
deficit approaching a million
dollars, and its effects are felt
painfully throughout the
university. In a bad year, an SRI
deficit could well multiply that
figure many times. Anyone
advocating retention and control
must face this difficulty squarely.
It is disturbing to us that
advocates of retention typically
ignore the difficulty altogether.
We challenge these people to
answer the simple question, who
would pay for what they ask? We
think the answer is obvious.
Stanford would pay. And
Stanford is not an abstraction: the
university is its faculty and its
students, their hopes and their
achievements. Courageous
programs for increasing minority
enrollment would have to be
scrapped and rolled back. The
search for new and exciting and
costly educational forms would
have to be abandoned and
replaced by mass education at its
worst, with student-teacher ratios
so unfavorable that the average
student would never see any of his
professors outside the lecture hall.
Increasingly the best teachers
would leave Stanford; students
without means could not enter,
and those able to choose would
not.
To dream of a Stanford
transformed into an agent of
active social reform, without
counting these costs, is sheer
utopianism.
But education is itself a social
enterprise. And Stanford, in ways
appropriate to it, is involved in
social change and must
responsibly continue to be. We
must continue to increase our
enrollment of disadvantaged
students. We must move yet
farther from the old image of
Stanford as the playground of the
children of the rich, and make it
an intellectual home for all who
seek knowledge. We must add
talented new administrative and
counseling personnel who are of
minority groups and also those
who have abilities important to
minority students and to the
study of urban minority
problems. We could well use a
department or school of urban
studies. All these desirable things
cost money. And here we see the
most attractive case for Stanford
divesting SRI, seeking a fair and
reasonable return on its past
investment and risks. The next
twenty years will be years of crisis
in what has clearly emerged as the
gravest social and moral problem
in the history of the Republic. We
ask to Stanford community to
visualize what Stanford might
now do to play its role in meeting
this crisis, if over these next
twenty years it had a steady,
added annual income of at least
$2 million which it could devote
wholly to these problems.
Any concrete proposal must
deal with a number of concerns:
The true interests of the
University and the furthering of
its special mission; the moral
issues raised by certain kinds of
research; and, without displacing
these concerns, the future
functioning of SRI.
We are agreed that the
following group of proposals,
taken as a set, provides the best
acceptable solution to the
exceedingly complex moral and
institutional problems which
Stanford faces in resolving its
relationship with SRI.
1. Divestiture with
preservation of the independence
and non-profit status of SRI.
2. Accomplishment of
divestiture via a long-term (20-25
year) mortgage loan which the
University makes to the Institute
which the Institute then
immediately uses to "purchase"
itself from the University —leaving
Stanford as a major creditor. The
Institute would then undertake to
repay the loan with an
appropriate amount of interest,
based on current long-term rates,
over a period of twenty or so
years. A fair price would be at
least equal to the net book value
of the University's equity in SRI.
3. For the agreed upon period
of the loan (20-25 years), whether
or not the loan is retired at an
earlier date, the University would
impose restraints upon the
Institute's activities. These would
be:
a) A prohibition of chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare research;
b) A prohibition of
counter-insurgency research and
of military research primarily and
directly related to the war in
Vietnam, or elsewhere in the
world, which is found to be
morally offensive or undesirable
by a review committee.
4. A review committee
discussed earlier would be set up
to advise the President on the
interpretation and enforcement of
the restraints, and to disseminate
information on SRl's activities.
The Trustees of the University
would accept an obligation to
enforce the restraints, through the
courts if necessary.
5. The name of the new
Institute would be changed from
Stanford Research Institute to
"SRI Inc." or something even less
suggestive of identity with the
University.
6. The University would use
the annual funds received from
SRI each year for the purposes of
furthering basic research and
educational programs.

V. SEPARATE STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Lyman
and Mr. Scott, in Which
Mr. Nivison Concurs
There is a great deal, indeed
most, of the Majority Statement

with which we agree, including
very emphatically the
recommendation for divestiture.
It reviews many of the issues
which have been raised before the
Committee, and sets forth the
relevant arguments. Its concluding
set of recommendations is a not
unreasonable attempt to strike a
balance among the numerous
competing considerations that
enter into a final decision. But
there are several points that seem
to us to deserve greater
recognition or emphasis.
A.
First and foremost, as the
Majority Statement recognizes,
the method of divestiture and sale
which it recommends will
probably produce a figure at the
bottom end of the estimated
range of value from $25 to $45
million, whereas other methods
might well yield proceeds toward
the top of that range. A difference
of possibly $20 million is no small
matter, and even more is that true
of the difference between selling
SRI and retaining it.
Our fear is that this may seem
abstract and of secondary
importance, instead of the vital
factor it is. Sums of this
magnitude need to be translated
into actual programs to be
appreciated. For example:
— The entire University
program of undergraduate and
graduate student assistance
(scholarships, fellowships and
grants) could be funded at present
levels for the next 10 years with
$41.3 million.
—The vast new research library
addition is projected to cost $20.2
million to construct and equip.
—It would require $900,000 a
year to expand the present
freshman seminar program to
include all freshmen.
—The current minority group
enrollment and academic
assistance program could be
doubled at an additional annual
cost of $500,000.
—The planned Moore-Jacks
dormitory complex, providing
badly needed student housing of
decent quality, would cost $11.2
million.
The list could be multiplied,
but the point is clear. It would be
the height of folly to treat the
amount of net cost or return, to
be realized from retention and
"alteration" of SRI or from a
particular mode of divestment and
sale, as just a minor element to be
brushed aside without careful
estimation in the course of
venting moral outrage by making
a "symbolic gesture." Perhaps
part of the attraction of symbolic
gestures is the notion that because
they are not justified on the basis
of having any immediate concrete
results of significance, one is also
excused from having to take into
account their immediate concrete
costs.
Many of those who press the
University to retain SRI and turn
it upside down, at never stated
losses, claim a purpose of
promoting the cause of more
socially beneficial and needed
research. It is worth examining,
therefore, how much more
effectively that cause could be
promoted by a course of sale
rather than retention.
We believe that Stanford would
have a unique opportunity to
show the ways in which a
university can direct its strength
to the solution of social problems,
within the bounds of its proper
specialization, by bringing to bear
its resources in the fields of basic
research and training.
We assume, here, that the sale
of SRI would bring the University
only about $35 million. We
assume further that one-third of
that amount would be made part
of the University's general
endowment to help relieve
pressures that have led, inter alia,
to a steady increase in tuition
charges. Suppose the remaining
funds were used to fund a major,

multi-focused program of Studies
in Public Policy at Stanford. Such
a venture would consist of
directing those things which a
university does best
undergraduate and graduate
teaching and research—to this new
area of study.
What follows is an indication
of the kind of new directions we
have in mind:
1. School Decentralization in
the Major Cities: This is a topic on
which political scientists,
economists, sociologists and
psychologists, as well as
professional 'educators, have
contributions to make.
For example, an economist in
the School of Education is
currently seeking funding for a
line of study which would throw
light on the economic aspects of
decentralization and on control
mechanisms that need to be
altered if effective
decentralization is to take place.
Again as an example, more needs
to be known about the ways in
which local governmental bodies
like school boards can handle
crisis issues, before effective
Strategies leading to
decentralization or any other
solution can be devised.
2. A second area of high
potential relevance to policy
might be described as comparative
urban studies. Each country, our
own included, has approached its
urban problems as if they were
unique. There is growing reason to
think that this is not the case, and
comparative analyses of problems
and solutions is now clearly called
for. There is much we need to
know, and we can learn from
elsewhere in the world.
3. One of the striking
developments in recent American
life has been the way in which the
university has been forcibly pulled
into the arena of public policy.
The examples are manifold: it is
an object of pressure in manpower
training, research, minority
problems, and not least, just plain
partisan politics. It is no
exaggeration to say that the
dimensions of the pressures are
only barely understood by those
responsible for the conduct of
higher education (students,
faculties, administrations, and
trustees) and that strategies for
using those pressures creatively
are even more rudimentary than
the understanding of them.
Without trying to specify the
content of a program, it seems
likely that there is the
opportunity here for relating
research to policy in ways that
will involve the entire community.
Stanford could serve for this
purpose as an archetype, a
laboratory, and ultimately one
would hope a model.
There is again no reason to
proliferate illustrations to convey
the point. But ideas and
possibilities require investment of
people and funds if they are to
become reality, and this is the side
too easy to ignore. What would it
take to mount a challenging new
effort along the foregoing lines?
Budgets and costs are never
exciting reading, but they are
what determine whether ideas can
be realized, and so we have
sketched out what would be
entailed. The sums attached to
each item are not the result of
careful calculation, but are
intended orders of magnitude and
relationships among the several
parts.
1) Faculty Augmentation.
No major programs directed to
the study of public policy can be
contemplated without new
faculty. In part this is because our
present faculty is already
stretched about as thinly as it can
be, and in part it is because new
competencies and combinations
of competencies will be needed.
We would think that one or more
najv appointments would be
needed in at least the following
fields or combinations of fields:

political science, economics,
sociology, anthropology, biology,
law, medicine, business and
engineering. This might involve
the establishment of 10 new
positions at the current going
endowment cost of $700,000
each.
2) Undergraduate Study.
There should be a new
undergraduate major in Public
Policy Analysis. It would begin
under the direction of an
inter-disciplinary committee, and
its most important feature would
be a linkage between student field
experience and the development
of analytical skills that give
meaning to experience and that
university study is uniquely able
to provide.
The new faculty would make
this program possible. The major
expense would be the cost of
arranging field experiences for
students. We assume 50 students
per year at an average cost of
$1000 each and an annual
administrative cost on the order
of $20,000 per year. The program
could be funded initially for five
years at a total of $350,000.
3) Graduate Study.
An essential obligation of the
University is the education of
future teachers, scholars, and
practitioners to the highest level.
That obligation applies fully here.
One effective way to meet that
obligation is to make it possible
for graduate students whose
interests lie in policy-relevant
subjects to apply the tools of their
disciplines to thesis topics on
those subjects. We would propose,
therefore, two-year dissertation
fellowships for students whose
topics require field observation
(or better still, participant
observation). The first year would
be spent in the field, the second in
writing the dissertation. Such a
program could be started for five
years, with 10 new fellows
appointed each year at stipends of
$5000 per year, for a total of
$500,000.
4) Center for the Study of
Public Policy.
In addition to enriching its
own education programs as
described above, Stanford might
make an even larger national
contribution through the
establishment of a Center for the
Study of Public Policy. The
Center could serve at least two
major purposes. First, it would
stimulate and finance research by
members of our own faculty and
student body; and second,
through a program of visiting
fellows, it would bring to campus
for periods of a quarter to a year a
group of persons in academic and
public life whose experience and
perspectives could be made more
productive as a group than they
are individually. We see a
programmatic or thematic
organization that is more directive
than, for example, that of the
Center for Advanced Study in the
Behavioral Sciences, but would
still provide the time for
reflection and independent study
and research that is so hard for
most men to find.
We estimate, very roughly, that
a Center of this kind would cost
about $600,000 per year to
operate. It could be funded for
five years at a total of $3 million.
Such a major thrust into areas
urgently demanding more research
and understanding —and more
consume less
than half of the estimated
proceeds remaining after a
substantial increment to
permanent endowment. Further,
it must be reiterated that none of
those resources could be created
by retaining SRI and
discontinuing large fractions of its
present work; what the latter
course really means is either
dismantling SRI or supporting it
too out of present University
funds.
It is for these reasons that we
stress not only the desirability but

also the obligation to follow a
course designed to yield the
greatest return to the University.
The Stanford trustees do not
operate the Institute and the
University on some basis of
parity; the University created SRI
and supplied the capital to start it,
and powers over its operation or
winding up and receipt of the
ultimate proceeds are vested in
the Stanford trustees not as
individuals but "for the use and
benefit of the Leland Stanford
Junior University." Either
destructive retention or gratuitous
severance from the University of a
capital asset with a value of from
$25 million to $45 million seems
a course hardly deserving any
serious consideration by
responsible men.
This issue should not be
confused with the sense of
obligation some feel toward those
individuals, corporations and
government agencies who have
made past gifts or grants to SRI,
aggregating $5.5 million by the
end of 1968. To the extent
charitable deducations were taken
on tax returns, some partially
offsetting direct benefits
obtained. Nonetheless, if a sale of
SRI were effected, it would
certainly be incumbent on the
University to explore with
substantial donors the question of
possible refund or of what their
expectations had been in making
the contribution and what
application of proceeds from sale
would most nearly continue to
carry out their original purposes.
It should remain clear, however,
that the possibility of a reduction
of net proceeds due to refund or
earmarking can hardly justify a
decision in favor of zero or
minimal proceeds.
B.
Secondly, we believe there
should be more recognition of a
case against the imposition of
prohibitions on research,
particularly in the vague and
over-broad terms employed by the
majority, founded on moral
principles that appear to require
no statement or definition in
order to understand their validity,
content and application.
In so saying we do not
deny —indeed we affirm with the
utmost emphasis at our
command—the urgent need for a
redirection of national priorities
in research and development. We
believe that the influence of the
military establishment of the
United States, as in the Soviet
Union, is far too great, and that
the absorption of so large a
proportion of our national
resources in pursuit of weaponry
is a major tragedy of our time.
This is especially true and
poignant given the unmet needs
of urban America and of our
disadvantaged minorities, and
given the rapid deterioration of
the human environment in this,
the richest nation in the history of
Man. The truth of these
statements is not diminished by
the fact that complete unilateral
disarmament is in our view an
untenable position, not by the
fact that much of the research
sponsored by the defense agencies
is basic research, with no direct or
even foreseeable military
applications, and crucial to the
forward progress of science in
general. But in research as in other
areas of our national life,
preoccupation with overkill has
become a threat to the future of
humanity.
We are among those who find
it more difficult than apparently
do some of the majority of the
Committee to make clear moral
distinctions among different types
of military weaponry or research.
This point is adverted to in the
Majority Statement, and we shall
not belabor it here. Bui there is an
additional set of problems created
by the form in which these
distinctions are cast.
The "prohibition of
counter-insurgency research"
recommended by the majority is
so broad a phrase in the minds of
some as to include any research
directed towards the economic
betterment of peoples living under
a government which faces any
rebellious opponents, regardless of
the latter's political complexion
or the political complexion of the
government. As for research
"which is found to be morally
offensive or undesirable by a
review committee," the prospect
is both limitless and hazy. It is
tantamount to postponement of
all decisions about research to
some undesignated future date, at
which time they will be taken
without benefit of guidelines, for
" morally offensive or
undesirable" can scarcely be
considered by itself a line which
would guide the members of the
committee to consider anything
except their personal likes and
dislikes at that moment in time.
Furthermore, making research
prohibitions both very broad and
imprecise also makes them harder
to enforce, whether in the context
of retention or sale of SRl—a
point that needs to be mroe
clearly realized.
In the context of retention,
adoption of prohibitions that are
at the same time sweeping and
most unclear is, as already noted,
not the making of a meaningful
decision but confession of
inability to make one. The
question is "solved" by refusing
to face the inherent complexity,
and perhaps erroneousness, of
what is being attempted.
In the context of sale, the
problem is much the same. As a
general rule, contracting parties
may undertake any obligations as
to their future conduct that they
are willing to agree to and that are
not illegal. If a covenant limiting
research is made sufficiently
incapable of application with
reasonable certainty, then it
becomes difficult or impossible
for a court to enforce it. If it is
also made very long-term or
perpetual in duration, other
limiting legal policies may come
into play.
It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
:lause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
Df the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
vvhat is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
ipon precision of thought.
2. Statement of McMahon
My agreement to the set of
jroposals in the Majority
Statement hinges on the
•equirement that an extensive
egal review be undertaken before

?nforceable. If there is doubt my
iupport goes to the Bauer and
Cleaver minority recommenda

In addition I feel strongly that
the Trustees' dec ion-making
process should be m open one,
and that reports of the voting
should be public.
VI. MINORITY STATEMENTS
1. Statement of Mr. Bernstein
Introduction
During the past six months, the
Committee met almost weekly,
and during that period much of
our time and effort was spent
gathering information and
discussing matters that often
seemed peripheral to my
definition of the central
issue—how to guarantee that SRI
is transformed into a socially

responsible institution that would
be prohibited from such activities
as research in chemical, biological
and radiological warfare,
counterinsurgency, projects
related to the war in Southeast
Asia, and projects designed to
expand American corporate or
political power abroad (primarily
the Third World) in order to
distort economic development or
thwart political change.
Despite my belief that
guaranteeing the transformation
of SRI was the central issue, I
found frequently that the
processes of the committee, the
camaraderie which flourished at
times, and the overriding concern
of some members with the details
of institutional relationships,
easily diverted efforts and
energies. As a result, for a long
period of time, I participated
uncritically in meetings and even
prepared a draft of a portion of a
report that did not address
directly and forcefully the urgent
and dominant issue.
None of this is intended as a
criticism of my colleagues, who
lab ored honestly and vigorously
on the problems that concerned
them; but I am presenting this
very brief sketch (and personal
interpretation) of the history of
the committee —as a warning and
an explanation. This sketch is a
warning to others who may serve
on committees in the future and
find that they are allowing their
moral and political commitments
to be diluted by the geniality of
deliberations. There is a danger of
subtle (and unintended)
co-optation—of losing critical
awareness, of concentrating upon
matters that are least divisive, of
emphasizing tactics and
mechanical details at the sacrifice
of ideology, and of developing an
excessive loyalty to the group,
which means placing a high value
on the "progress" of deliberations
and the effort to achieve
consensus. This sketch also
explains why I and some other
members of the committee were
compelled to begin preparing
position papers just before the
deadline for submitting reports.
The process of false agreement, of
avoiding ideological issues,
continued until Wednesday,
breaking down only three days
before our deadline. (Obligations
to students in my classes, as well
as commitments to the students
courageously sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
and other obligations to the
University, left me virtually
without time until late Friday
evening to begin writing this
statement.)
By necessity, then, this
statement cannot be the lengthy
and sustained analysis that the
community and the students at
AEL deserve, and I can only hope
to sketch my conclusions and
reasoning, and anticipate some
objections, while promising to
present a more complete analysis
in future discussions in the
communitv.
Restrictions on Research
at SRI and the University
It is unconscionable for a
university to sanction, assist or
sponsor research in 1) chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, 2) counter-insurgency, 3)
activities directly related to the
continuation of the war, and 4)
activities designed to expland
American corporate or
governmental power over the
peoples of other nations. In
opposing the first three activities,
apparently a majority, if not all
members, of the Committee
least in reference to
SRI. By the logic of their position
(as well as mine), these
prohibitions should be extended
to the university. Such
restrictions,! though an
infringement on the normal
practice of academic freedom, can
be justified by an overridding
principle: the immorality of
allowing or encouraging the

creation of "knowledge" which,
by design, contributes to weapons
and techniques for killing, injuring
or exploiting people. Such
prohibitions will not generally
infringe upon the justifiable and
vital intellectual activity of a
university—the investigation of
problems and the creation and
dissemination of ideas that may
be evaluated, and accepted or
rejected, by others; in such cases,
in theory and often in practice,
men may by an exercise of will
oppose or resist these ideas. But
proposals for weaponry,
inprovements in the modes of
killing, techniques, for extending
economic are not
simply, ideas, and they cannot be
resisted by their victims. The will
of the victim is inadequate, and
the will of the oppressor
dominates.
Objections to Sale-
Even with Some Restrictions
For two reasons I disagree with
the majority's recommendation to
sell SRI with restrictions. First,
there is some basis for doubting
whether such restrictions could be
effectively enforced. 2 Even
assuming that a satisfactorily
constituted committee would
vigorously monitor and report
upon the activities of SRI, there
would also have to be: a) a
guarantee by the Trustees of
Stanford University that they will
bring legal suit to enforce the
guidelines in any cases of reported
violations by the committee; and
b) strong evidence that such
restrictions, imposed in the bill of
sale (and even with the university
as creditor), would be upheld and
enforced by the court. There is
some reason to doubt whether the
court would enforce such
restrictions on SRI, and so far as
the Committee knows there is no
precedent on the subject. In
addition to this problem, there is
another related consideration:
during litigation, SRI might be
able to continue violating the
guidelines.
Second, sale of SRI would also
destroy the University
community's opportunity to
extend at present and
in the future: a) to restrain other
forms of undesirable research
(e.g., economic imperialism,
classified research); and b) to
channel resources into more
socially responsible activities. 4
There are at least two reasons for
objecting to classified
(including restrictions on
communication, publication, or
access to data): one, it is
inappropriate, certainly difficult,
and maybe impossible to monitor
research if only those with
security clearances may examine
all the activities of the Institute;
two, classification is likely to be
imposed by the Government
primarily in the areas of research
which should be prohibited by
guidelines, and therefore rejection
of classification may be an
effective way of excluding much
of the morally unacceptable work.
(Ironically, in the course of our
deliberations, members of the
Committee pointed out that SRI
might have contracts with security
classifications that prohibit
personnel at SRI from even
informing the Committee or
members of the University
administration of the existence of
such contracts.) In regard to
economic imperialism, it is
important to protect people
elsewhere in the world from
economic and political coercion,
and it is certainly unacceptable to
use facilities at a university-owned
or un iver si t y -c o nn ec te d
isntitution to oppress or exploit
people.6
Consideration of
Some Objections to
Retention and Control of SRI
Some members of the
university community recommend
the sale of SRI because they
believe that it would be
impossible or very difficult to
redirect SRl's activities from

war-related and imperialistic
activities to more socially
responsible enterprises, and that
such revisions might well impair
or destroy SRI. In a related
argument, some contend that the
contributions that the University
might make (for example, the
establishment of an institute for
the study of social or urban
problems) with the funds from
sale would far outweigh the social
costs of letting SRI, as an
independent agency, continue its
war-related and imperialistic
activiites. It is hard to assess the
difficulty or impossibility of
transforming SRI into a socially
responsible institution, but such
difficulty or impossibility does
not constitute a persuasive reason
for selling SRI and letting* it
operate freely or with only a few
restraints. And in the second case
(where the funds might be
expended elsewhere), there is a
dubious moral calcualtion which
seems to deny or minimize both
the social costs of SRl's policies
to people abroad and the
Univeristy's responsibility for
those social costs. Sale would not
remove the University's moral
responsibility for creating SRI or
for allowing SRI to continue these
activities. In substance, the
University would be seeking to
achieve institutional purity
without acknowledging its larger
responsibility. The University
cannot simply create powerful
institutions and then, by act of
sale, deny all moral and political
responsibility for their predictable
future actions.?
Moving beyond these issues, it
is necessary to consider the
argument raised especially by
proponents of sale without
restrictions on research—that the
University, itself, should not try
to alter the nature of research in
the society, and that members of
the university community should
operate in the political system to
change federal policy. This
argument reveals an unwillingness
or reluctance to acknowledge
certain painful political realities:
the American political system has
not been particularly responsive in
recent years to significant
portions of the population who
have demanded a revision of
national policy. This is not the
appropriate place to analyze this
problem in depth, but it may be
useful to remind members of this
community that many citizens in
1964 went to the polls to register
their opposition to the escalation
of the Vietnam war and therefore
voted for the candidate who
opposed escalation—Lyndon B.
Johnson, who soon escalated the
war, as he had planned before the
election. In addition, the
argument against the university's
restricting research at SRI often
assumes that universities and their
subsidiary institutions should
simply respond to market demand
or to the federal government's
definition of the national interest,
and that the university should
eschew independent criticism and
judgment, In effect, this would
mean acquiescing in the
transformation of the university
into an elaborate service station
prepared to provide what the
market wants to buy or what the
Government believes the nation
needs.
The Political University
Some objections to the
retention and control of SRI are i
based upon the unrealistic fear that
the University will be transformed
into a political institution. Of this
there is little danger, for the
University is already a profoundly
political® institution —by virtue of
making its resources available to
only one side in the Vietnam war,
by virtue of the support for the
continued presence of ROTC as
part of the educational program.
For the University to become
non-political, it would have to
make its resources available to all
groups regardless of politics
(including the NLF and North

Vietnam), or to no one. It is true
that some wish to move towards
the establishment of a
non-political institution and view
the abolition of ROTC and the
assertion of guidelines and control
over SRI as necessary steps along
that path. Whatever the merits of
this vision, there seems to be little
likelihood of this small group's
rescuing the University from those
who wish the University to
continue its present politics.
Summary of Recommendations
In summary, the university
must retain and control SRI by
establishing and enforcing
guidelines to direct SRI to follow
socially responsible policies and to
prohibit research in chemical,
biological and radiological
warfare, cou nterinsurgency,
projects directly related to the
continuation of the war in
Southeast Asia, and projects
designed to extend American
corporate or governmental power
over the peoples of other nations.
Notes
1. Obviously there is need to
define these restrictions carefully,
and I submitted to the Committee
at various times tentative
formulations that I assume will
appear in the Committee's file at
Meyer Library. (See in particular
pp. 31-33 and revisions of the first
draft of the Committee's report.)
Committees to review research
proposals might well be created in
line with "Suggestions for
Guidelines for Research at
Stanford and SRI."
2. I have only received a copy
of a draft of the majority's
conclusions, and so I do not know
much about the content of their
final report. However, I would
like to emphasize that the
majority reached agreement only
by compromising a set of
proposals, and that the majority
would be reduced to a minority if
the guidelines prove not to be
legally enforceable upon sale.
3. For example, guidelines
might be excluded to bar research
for the ABM, or all research
sponsored by the Department of
Defense.
4. Some have suggested the
creation of an inter-disciplinary
institute for research on peace and
social problems. Presumably some
exceptions to the prohibition
might be made by a committee
upon appeal.
5. Classified research
significantly restricts the
communication of scientific
information, and the exclusion of
all or most classification at
Stanford would prod other
universities to consider similar
policies and the Government to
relax some of its restrictions.
6. It is not the intent of this
prohibition to suggest, necessarily,
that all of SRl's economic work
overseas is related to economic
imperialism, and obviously the
phrasing of a precise guideline on
this subject requires more
information about SRl's activities
and policies than the Committee
has received.
7. Admittedly, retention and
control of SRI may divert
allegedly scarce administrative
talent at the University from
other activities, but this will then
be a part of the price the
University will have to pay for
responsibility.
8. "Political" is not to be
confused with "partisan"
(whether the university is
Republican or Democratic).
2. Statement of
Mr. Cleaver and Miss Bauer
INTRODUCTION
Prefacing a report on AID and
the University, Stanford trustee
John Gardner remarked: "There
isn't one American in a hundred,
perhaps a thousand, who has a
clear grasp of the unique
partnership that is evolving
between public and private
instrumentalities in this country."
SRI, along with a handful of
not-for-profit research institutes
elsewhere, is best viewed as a new
component in this evolving
partnership and a key coordinator
of the joint efforts of competing
corporations, of corporations with
government, of government and
industry with the university.
First a simple research depot
for West Coast businesses, then a
pioneer in the partnership of a
defense industry and the
Pentagon, SRI has now moved
into its own as a stragetic center
for the economic and military
penetration of the
underdeveloped world and
America's own ghetto colonies.
Having come to this position,
SRI would find covenants against
particularly noxious research,
even if workable, and severance of
the formal relationship with
Stanford little more than a
tactical detour on an already
chosen path. Only a wholesale
reorientation of SRl—and of
Stanford—can undo the harm we
have helped create. That
reorientation demands a
strengthening of ties between
Stanford and SRI, and between
the concerned people in both
institutions and the surrounding
community.
On October 10, 1968, two
days after SDS formally
demanded that "Stanford Get out
of Southeast Asia," Acting
President Robert Glaser
announced the formation of a
twelve-member committee to
report on present and possible
future relationships between
Stanford and SRI. For over six
months the authors of this
dissenting report tried to work
within the framework of that
committee. Although we
recognized that the formation of
the committee was just putting
off the inevitable confrontation,
we had hoped that the committee
could help place new information
before the community in the
course of its deliberations and
that its report could clarify some
of the important issues. We had
hoped that the committee could
help illuminate the core of the
Stan ford-SRI relationship—the
personal influences of the David
Packards and Ernest Arbuckles;
the market power of big business,
big government, and the big
foundations; the ideological
impact of elite values and
top-down methodologies widely
shared in both institutions.
But we soon discovered a
fixation of the majority of the
committee members on legal and
formal SRI-University
connections. They preferred to
dwell on the technical aspects of
alternative future actions.
Unwilling to cause radical division
within the committee, which we
feared would impede its data
gathering function, we found
ourselves avoiding frequent
conflict when expressions of our
own concerns met with no
sympathetic response in the
committee.
Inexorably the drive of the
committee became one towards
consensus on "feasible
alternatives" and rigorously
detailing them. Having expected
the division of community
opinion between divestment of
SRI and closer ties, we thought
ourselves ready to deal v ith this.
But we slowly were taken in by
the endless hours of haggling over
fine details of imaginary
formulations, until our objections
to the overall direction of the
committee were lost in a forest of
words. We, too began to think
that some "neutral," "objective"
view of the alternatives could
issue from the interplay in the
committee.
To this end we thought we
could amend our interpretation of
the situation and therein draw our
own conclusions as a minority
statement. Indeed, only a week
before termination of the report
we had an eighteen-page draft of
such a statement.

In was then that we began to
understand dimly what had
happened. For three days we
struggled with the contradiction
between our draft and the
"objective" and "neutral"
cost-benefit approach to which we
were appending it. In this struggle
we came to recognize the impact
such an approach had upon the
ideas and facts we emphasized.
The very functioning of the
committee had insured that the
most vital issues be excluded. The
cost-benefit approach was
couched in a set of premises
which assume away any basic
conflict of interest between
students and faculty and their
business men trustees. Once we
recognized this we were forced to
dissassociate from that which we
had helped construct. We were
faced with the necessity of
expanding our draft sufficiently
to create a new report which
would speak to the issues we feel
to be critical—one which would
do so within the context of the
very real political struggle swirling
around us.
We had to do this in a very
short time period. We regret tfte
unpolished form of this report.
We take responsibility for any of
our research inaccuracies or
factual errors. However, we hope
that our efforts will be of use to
the Stanford community in
coming to grips with its present
problems.
******
PARTI. FROM LITTLE ACORNS
SRI'S origins, in retrospect,
seem quite modest. The West
Coast economy emerged from
World War II greatly strengthened,
but with today's aerospace and
electronics riches still only a
gleam in the eye of a few
visionaries like Stanford's
Frederick Terman. By and large
the economy ; rested on the
pre-war chemical, petroleum, and
food industries. In a post-war
world where knowledge would
become power in new and
profitable ways, Western
universities had fallen well behind
Harvard, Johns Hopkins, MIT, and
the other Eastern schools then
swimming in the spill-over from
war-time research. Terman found
Stanford "an under-privileged
institution" largely left out of
"the exciting engineering and
scientific activity associated with
the war." The pioneer
not-for-profit research
i nstitutes—Mellon, Batelle,
Armour —or even profit-making
researchers like Boston's Arthur
D. Little Company had no
counterparts in the West. At the
same time, regional leaders in the
Midwest, South, and Southwest
were busily laying plans for
institutes of their own.
But Western businessmen and
educators were quite responsive to
the region's research gap. In fact
present antagonists of SRI can
lodge paternity suits against at
least three different groups. The
first centered around three
Stanford men—Robert E. Swain,
professor of chemistry and for a
time acting president of Stanford;
Stanford chemist Philip A.
Leighton, decorated at the end of
WW II for his part at Stanford in
the creation of firebombs and
later a researcher in the
meteorological aspects of
Chemical-Biological Warfare
(CBW); and alumnus Dudley
Swim, later board chairman of
National Airlines. Self-christened
"The Three Musketeers," the
group had discussed the idea of a
Stanford-based research institute
as early as 1939, at an
encampment of San Francisco's
exclusive Bohemian Club. They
revived the idea after the war,
gaining the support of University
President Donald B. Tresidder.
Also at the close of the war,
three members of the wartime
staff of Lockheed Aircraft
Corporation actually set up a
Pacific Research Foundation in
Los Angeles. This group

eventually joined in the formative
talks about SRI, folding up their
own shop when the
Stanford-based institute became a
reality.
But the most important of the
founding fathers was Atholl
Mcßean, a prominent San
Francisco Industrialist and
director of Stanford Oil of
California. With the cooperation
of Stanford Vice President Alvin
C. Eurich, Mcßean invited
recommendations for a Pacific
Coast research center from Clyde
Williams, president of Batelle
Memorial Institute, and Henry T.
Heald, president of the Illinois
Institute of Technology and the
Armour Research Foundation,
and later of the Ford Foundation.
Heald presented his
recommendations on January 24,
1946, to a gathering of San
Francisco business executives. In
his short three-page statement, he
called for a high quality industrial
research institute to serve
individual companies, groups of
companies in association, and
agencies of government —federal,
state and local.
Trustees Keep Power
All three of the founding
groups favored a strong link
between industry and education.
Heald called for university
affiliation, specifically with
Stanford. A month iater,
responding to the enthusiasm
generated by the Meßean-Heald
report and to Mcßean's pledge of
$100,000, the Stanford Board of
Trustees agreed in principle on the
creation of the Stanford Research
Institute. Then, in December,
sitting as the general members of
SRI, the Stanford trustees
approved a set of by-laws and
elected a slate of directors to
govern the new institute. They
retained for themselves the power
to elect directors annually and to
dissolve the corporation at their
discretion. They also assumed
some measure of financial
responsibility, which resulted in a
$600,000 loan in 1948 and 1951,
offered access to some of the
university's library and laboratory
resources, provided consultants
(53 by 1968) and teaching
positions to SRI staff (14 in
1968), and lent the prestige of
Stanford, which aided in
attracting staff.
In the words of the university
public relations office, SRI
became a "wholly owned
subsidiary of the university."
The real ties of power over
SRI, however, were never as neat
as the legal niceties. The first SRI
Board of Directors, which met for
the first time on January 8, 1947,
was divided between members of
the university board and West
Coast leaders who were not
Stanford trustees. From the
Stanford Board came President
Tresidder (Chairman), Vice
President Eurich, investment
banker Charles Blyth, John E.
Cushing of Matson Navigation,
and industrialist W. P. Fuller Jr.,
father of the present Stanford
trustee. The other directors, not
Stanford trustees, were Mcßean,
Paul McKee (president of Pacific
Power and Light), D. J. Russell
(vice president of Southern
Pacific), William L. Stewart, Jr.
(executive vice president of Union
Oil), and James D. Zellerbach
(president of Crown-Zellerbach).
This combination of industrial
interests provided a group even
more powerful and somewhat
broader than the Stanford Board
of Trustees.
These men dedicated SRI
chiefly to the industrial
development of the Western
states. They sought financial
support largely from industry
rather than government, and they
were themselves chief among the
initial SRI Associates,
corporations and individuals who
paid $15,000 each to help support
the new venture.
Of the early SRI industrial
research some 7 4 per cent went to

petroleum and natural gas people,
11 per cent to food products
firms, and 10 per cent to chemical
firms. Among the early associates
were Humble, Richfield, Shell,
Stanford Oil of California, and
Union Oil. "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university,"
SRI publicists wrote.
The new Institute also moved
in 1949 and 1950 to provide some
leadership as well as research
capability to West Coast business,
joining with the San Francisco
Chamber of Commerce, the
University of California, and
Stanford to organize business
conferences on the industrial
importance of research.
During the same year that the
"Applied Research Center for the
West" was building its partnership
with industry, it was also serving
government (though to a far lesser
degree). At its founding SRI
postulated "an important
obligation to the government of
the United States to assist with
scientific research needed for the
national defense and welfare, and
to keep our facilities open for a
national emergency." By 1950
SRI had yielded even more of its
basic emphasis on industrial
research, possibly hoping that
defense department dollars for
electrical equipment studies and
research on ''explosion
phenomena" might help fill the
Institute's $450,000 deficit. Still,
about three-fourth of SRl's $2
million research budget came
from private clients.
Korean War
Then, in mid-1950, the Korean
war erupted, and SRl's
hot and-cold war partnership with
the Pentagon began in earnest.
Doubling the portion of its
government research from 23% in
January to 45% in December, the
Institute undertook work in
advanced engineering design,
strategy planning, projects for the
Atomic Energy Commission, and
studies of government research
facilities. On the basis of such
work, much of it classified, SRI
continued to gain a larger and
larger percentage of its revenue
from government contracts
through 1965.
But in this shift, SRI did more
than simply produce for the new
military demand. It also helped
produce the demand itself.
SRI did this in several ways.
It's earliest military studies for
example, helped prepare a climate
of opinion favorable to the
expansion of armaments and, not
incidentally, of the particular
armaments firm growing to
maturity in the West Coast
economy. Studying the time it
would take to build the giant fleet
of aircraft in 1948, if war should
break out, SRI scientists posed
two alternatives: mobilization
with a year (1949) and
mobilization with three years
(1951). This multi-disciplinary
M-Day approach did in fact aid
the eventual mobilization. But its
self-fulfilling assumptions, later
applied to electronic equipment
and aircraft engine production,
also heightened the likelihood
that mobilization would come.
Other studies over the years of
how to maintain U.S. production
in full scale air war, development
of civil defense and preparedness
programs, and the like helped
shape the cold war climate of the
fifties, in which Americans could
all too easily think the
unthinkable.
SRI executives also sponsored
"the world struggle against
Communism" and the garrison
state partnership in less academic
fashion. "Even now," wrote 1950
director Jesse Hobson "the united
research endeavors of industry,
government, private individuals,
and research organizations present
an imposing bulwark for the

safety of this nation."
"Research," he urged, "is a sword
hat is sharpened by use."
At meetings of SRI associates,
speakers such as Donald D.
Quarles, the Assistant Secretary of
Defense for Research and
Development in 1963, urged the
associates "to help us create
public confidence that we are in
fact making wise disposition of
our defense resources." And, in
enlarging the Board, SRI leaders
brought in leading aerospace
industrialists like Donald W.
Douglas, vice president of Douglas
Aircraft in 1949, and in 1951,
industrialist John A. McCone, the
Deputy Secretary of Defense in
1948, Undersecretary of the Air
Force in 1950, and later director
of the Atomic Energy
Commission and the Central
Intelligence Agency. Then setting
new policy in 1954, after Korea,
the board moved to strengthen
defense orientation.
ABM Recoups Losses
To be fair, SRI leadership in
this process was really
overshadowed by the work of the
University itself. Where SRl's
directions placed its initial faith in
private industry, the real architect
of the Peninsula defense
economy, Stanford's Frederick E.
Terman, then dean of engineering,
looked much more hopefully to
military financing of
research-oriented industry.
Consequently, he built up a
"steeple of excellence" with key
university departments, opened
university labs to industry, helped
spin-off firms like Varian and
Granger Associates, and led in the
creation of the Stanford Industrial
Park in 1951. These efforts, and
of course the federal financing,
actually made aerospace and
electronics the big guns of
California industry. During the
first eighteen months of the
Korean War, for example,
California employment in the
electronics industry rose 117 per
cent.
Faced with an entirely new
economy, SRl's course was clear.
Merely to maintain its partnership
with industry, it would have to
integrate the new industrialists,
both from the Peninsula and from
Southern California, and further
tie itself to the Pentagon.
The process of integration was
dramatic. In 1955 Terman joined
the SRI board as vice chairman of
the newly formed executive
committee. Then, in 1956 came
Arnold Beckman of Beckman
Instruments in the Industrial Park,
followed by industrialist Edgar
Kaiser in 1957, David Packard in
1958. Tom Jones, president of
Northrup Aircraft joined in 1961.
along with General William A.
Draper and Thomas P. Pike, both
of whom had occupied high
administrative positions in the
Department of Defense during the
Eisenhower administration. The
number of new defense industries
among SRI Associates was equally
impressive.
Under the leadership of these
men and corporations, SRI
established a Naval Warfare
Research Center, a Strategic
Studies Center, and a Tactical
Operations Program to search for
more effective weapons systems
and the concepts for their use
along with millions of dollars o;
research in space and missile
science.
But the real clincher is SRI s
leadership in an increasingly
unpopular field of missile defense.
By 1963, research on the ABM
had become important to SRI and
to associated industries. Facing a
downturn in the California
defense economy, SRI executive
vice president Weldon Gibson
spoke publicly about "possible
existence of agreements between
the United States and the Soviet
Union leading toward arms
limitation" and"the fact that
more and more leaders are
supporting the judgment that the
arsenal of missiles and warheads
has reached a point of diminishing
returns."
By 1964, however, at the
bottom of the pre-Vietnam
economic lull, he saw "indications
that short-term losses over the
next few years may be recouped
later in the decade with new
developments in anti-missile
missiles or a new generation of
strategic weapons."
Vietnam pulled Gibson and the
California economy out of that
particular crisis, but now that the
very escalation in Vietnam has
started to hurt economically,
especially in those industries
dependent on subsidized research,
the ABM is once again with
us. . . and with SRI.
According to the government's
1968 Technical Abstract Bulletin,
among SRI reports are the
following:

PART 11. AROUND THE WORLD
Coordination
Though tempting, it would be I
misleading to focus too heavily on
SRl's leadership in the
"m ilitary-ind us trial- academic
complex." The SRI board was
interested in more than simple
defense industries, and the
Institute itself has appetites far
beyond the fluctuating
expenditures of the military.
Expansionist, rather than merely
defenders of what they already
have, the SRI people have best
expressed their particular genius
by providing strategic leadership
and technical manpower for the
■nternational expansion of West
Coast corporations.
SRl's first big foreign push
came in 1957, a natural
internationalization of the earlier
emphasis on regional development
.hrough private industry. Weldon
libson, the man who has headed
'>Rl's international program since
its beginning in 1949, has stated
nat SRI is dedicated to two
objectives: "economic progress,
.nd the strengthening of private
business on an international scale.
Tiese are good and noble causes
md we are proud to stand with
nternational companies the world
over in pursuit of~ the
fundamentals involved. Our
objective is to do everything
within our power to develop the
private sector as the basic factor
in economic strength and
progress." (SRI-International, No.
11 —1969. The Lima Report.)
The Institute also had a solid
oase of experience in piecemeal
research and special projects.
These experiences were as as
diverse as development studies on
Cuba, Pakistan, India, Peru,
Venezuela, Bolivia, Chile,
Argentina, and Brazil, the
establishment of a technical

information service for American
firms in Europe and an office in
Zurich, liason with research
institutes abroad, and
management trips abroad. But the
main thrust, naturally enough,
was in the Pacific Area. In 1949
Secretary of State George C.
Marshall and Harold Stassen
invited SRI staff-member Eugene
Staley to Washington to "help
revise the American policy on
China" and to study the "problem
of halting the advance of
Communism in the rest of the Far
East." SRI was at the time
studying the decline of Oriental
commerce along the West Coast,
and later undertook a study for
Matson Navigation Co. on the
feasibility of re-establishing
passenger service in the Pacific.
(On Matson's board sat Stanford
trustee and SRI director Charles
R. Blyth, president of Blyth &
Co., Inc.) SRI also cooperated
with the Asia Foundation, which
has been known as a CIA conduit,
in an exploration of private
investment possibilities and
potentials in Pakistan, Ceylon,
Burma, Thailand, Indonesia,
Japan, and the Phillipines.
The landmark in the
development of SRl's
internationalism and in the
supra-national union of private
enterprise it represented was the
International Industrial
Development Conference (IIDC)
of 1957. Co-sponsored with
Time—Life International, the
conference brought 500 "key
business executives" from 62
nations together —something of a
first in the post-war period. Their
common dedication was "to the
role of private enterprise in
stimulating economic and
industrial development in the free
world. The major objective of the
meeting is to pool the experience
of banking and industrial leaders
in an examination of problems
and proposals effecting industrial
development throughout the
world." (Research for Industry,
Vol. 9, No. 7.) Among others
addressing the conference, two
names stand out: Henry Luce of
Time-Life and Alfried Krupp von
Bohlen, proprietor of a
well-known German family
business.
With the conference, SRI
moved even farther from its
origins as a department store for
corporation research and closer to
its present task of reducing
international competition.
Through in t e r - b u si n e s s
communication and "a dynamic
partnership and philosophy
among those who guide much of
the economic destiny of the free
world," a movement toward the
reduction of competition among
individual firms seems to be at
hand. By focusing on
"relationships in newly developing
areas between government
development programs and private
enterprise" and "techniques for
investor-government collaboration
under private management," it
sought to reduce the anachronistic
competition between private
enterprise and public bodies.
Institutionally, the conference
led to the formation of SRl's
International Industrial
Development Center, and a going
concern with research problems
such as "Private U.S. Venture
Capital for Investment in Newly
Developed Countries" and
"Brazil: Factors Affecting Foreign
Investment." (SRI Annual
Report, 1957, SRI Press Release
10/3/58.)
SRl's premise was that
corporate investment capital and
Third World investment
"opportunities" had to be more
efficiently brought together and
that SRI should do the job.
Since 1957, SRl's role as a
coordinator of overseas corporate
strategy has grown. The 1966
international programs that had
increased through the years, often
under the supervision of Staley or
Weldon "Hoot" Gibson, were

brought together in a new
managerial entity,
SRI-International, with Gibson as
head. The Institute announced
that this reflected "a basic policy
decision by the . . . Board of
Directors and management to
expand research operations in the
international field."
"Major emphasis will be placed
on research projects for business
and industry, economic
development projects for
government and international
institutes, and projects involving
major programs in the security of
the United States," SRI
announced. Corporate investment
planning, government sponsored
"development" programs in the
Third World, and counte
rinsurgency research thus came
solidly under one roof at SRI.
The one area where these
activities have been thus merged
more efficiently than in any other
has been the Pacific. There
international cooperation has
reached an advanced stage in what
American industrialists are calling
the "Pacific Basin strategy,"
something SRI-International's
Weldon Gibson denied innocently
in a letter to the October 11
Daily: "We have no Pacific Basin
strategy," he said, "other than a
program of research and public
service aimed at accelerating
economic and industrial
development in all the Pacific
nations."
Bank of America president
Rudolph Peterson, a member of
the SRI-International advisory
committee, has been somewhat
more candid: "There is no more
vast or rich area for resource
development or trade growth in
the world today," he said in a
Chamber of Commerce
publication. "Were we California
businessmen to play a more
dynamic role in helping trade
development in the Pacific Rim,
we would have giant, hungry new
markets for our products and vast
new profit potentials for our
firms."
The idea of a Pacific Basin
strategy is total rationalization
and control by business interests
of the overall Pacific economy,
using government funds, agencies
and military might when
necessary. "Pacific Trade," a SRI
pamphlet that prepared the way
for the SRI-sponsored Pacific
Industrial Conference in April of
1967, outlined an idea for a
Pacific Basin Organization for
Economic Cooperation, through
which the corporations of
advanced industrial countries
would cooperate rather than
compete—seemingly a sort of
giant price-fixing,
resource-sharing, pie-slicing
organization which would decide
on "specialization between
countries to take advantage of the
potentially huge economies of
scale in . . . production," develop
a "systematic exchange of
technical information," encourage
"frequent consultation among
business groups," and "joint
assistantance and cooperation in
the further development of
less-industrialized areas of the
Pacific basin."
The organization would be
"confined at the outset to the
more industrialized nations" and
would be "primarily under private
auspices."
SRl's Pacific Industrial
Conference in Sidney, Australia,
in April of last year, attended by
125 "senior executives" from 22
nations, was opened with a speech
from SRI chairman and Stanford
dean of business Ernest Arbuckle,
no stranger to Australia where
Utah Construction has extensive
iron and coal interests.
Arbuckle said that Stanford
professor Eliot Mears' pre-WW II
description of the Pacific Basin as
"an economic community of the
future" articulated a basic view
"that remains today in principle
and practice within both Stanford
University and Stanford Research

Institute."
Gibson told the businessmen
that their meeting was
noteworthy because "it is an act
of leadership by private enterprise
in the interests of free nations
throughout the Pacific" and"it is
organized entirely under private
auspices with an emphasis on the
growth of private enterprises."
President Johnson sent a telegram
hailing "a sense of common
economic destiny . . . growing
among peoples in the Pacific
Basin."
The Sydney meeting was the
first of a plethora of such
gatherings under SRI auspices. It
led to the SRI-led August invasion
of Indonesia by about 200 "senior
executives" who arrived to
"acquaint" themselves with
"current conditions" and stayed
to arrange corporate investments.
Indonesia "contains extensive
natural resources," SRI explained.
The meeting "created a new and
highly effective relationship
between business and the
government in Indonesia," Gibson
said later. (Manila Agenda, p. 2.)
The Djakarta meeting in turn
led to an SRI-Singapore Meeting
last summer at which 170 "leaders
of private enterprise" were moved
to "strongly endorse the concept
of regional economic development
in Southeast Asia."
Southeast Asia, in fact, has
been the focus of much of
S R I -1 nt er national's recent
attention. The SRI-Singapore
meeting was followed by an
SRI-Manila meeting "devoted to
Business in Southeast Asia," in
March of this year. Opening the
meeting, Gibson explained: "This
part of the globe will surely be at
the center of world attention
during the next decade or more,"
he said. "This will be especially so
in the economic field once
military strife in the region is
abated." Unfazed by the agitation
among students at Stanford,
Gibson eulogized "private
business" as "the greatest social
invention of modern times" and
pledged SRl's "continuing
assistance" to the development of
"private enterprise" in Southeast
Asia, particularly Indonesia,
Malaysia, the Philippines,
Singapore, and Thailand.
Other SRI-International
business conferences have
included the North Atlantic
Industrial Conference (October,
1967, in Seville, Spain), last
November's Conference on
East-West Trade (Vienna), and
this January's SRI-Lima Meeting
in Peru, a country in which the
entire Stanford complex is deeply
involved. After the Peruvian
meeting, Gibson wrote that all of
the meetings in the
series —Sydney, Djakarta,
Singapore, Seville, Vienna, and
Lima—"were dedicated to the
advancement of economic
development and to the growth of
private enterprise—especially
international business."
COIN
For the underdeveloped
nations, the bite in the SRI-style
coordination and control of
investment flows is the direct
tie-in with counter-insurgency
efforts. Coordination of
investments which benefit many
of the Stanford and SRI
associated corporations create a
natural interest in the economic
and social "stability "—the
maintenance of a proper
"investment climate."
In 1957, Henry Robison, SRI
senior economist, began his
speech to a Stanford Alumni
Association Conference on
"America's Stake in World
Economic Stability" with: "since
World War 11, the United States
has been thrust upon the world's
stage in a position of power and
influence probably undreamed of
even by those statesmen of a past
generation who were imbued with
a spurt of manifest destiny."
Discussing "the economic factors

which underly the political
relationships" between American
and the Third World, he asserted
that the countries of Southeast
Asia "are more important for
their geographic position than for
their economic potential."
Robison argued that "at last freed
of the Western political
domination of the past century,"
it is essential for the Third World
"that their progress be made
under Western guidance and
Western concepts of individual
freedom rather than under the
heavy hand of Communist
slavery." He concluded that "The
free world must not lose
Southeast Asia . . . as it has
already lost China.
The fear of "losing" Southeast
Asia is presumably just the reason
that SRI did a study that same
year titled "Environmental
Conditions in.Selected Areas of
Potential Limited Warfare," which
was prepared for McDonnell
Aircraft Corporation and which
described in detail the application
of "limited" warfare techniques
to certain peripheral areas of Asia,
including Vietnam.
By 1961 SRI senior economist
Eugene Staley was in Vietnam
performing what has become a
second job for SRI
"developmentalists"-advising the
U.S. government of methods for
bringing "stability" to its
subordinate dictatorships. Staley
headed President John Kennedy's
special financial group to the
Diem government-in-trouble in
Vietnam. The group's purpose was
to develop a plan of "coordinated
financial action which would be in
support of counter-guerrilla
activities." His recommendations
to JFK were for an increase in aid
for military measures and for
''economic and social
development," including
"resettlement" where it was
necessary to "remove the
population from Viet Cong
pressures." The program was
expected to "restore security
within 18 months." It didn't.
In 1966, SRI took a second
stab at this special kind of social
reform, this time sending senior
economist William Bredo to the
Saigon government on the
formulation and implementation
of a program of land tenure
reform. "In view of the critical
situation in South Vietnam,"
began the unsolicited SRI project
proposal to AID, "the proposal
emphasis is on political objectives
rather than economic goals."
"It is considered most
important at this time to stress a
program of land tenure reform
which emphasizes social justice,
which produces a more favorable
rearrangement of the rural power
structure, and which will tend to
produce political results that will
contribute to winning the war,"
the proposal said.
Maintaining a proper
investment climate, land reform,
financial counseling—none of
these programs sound anything
like as sinister as "counter
insurgency." But this subtlety is
in the very nature of COIN
activities, especially as developed
under the Kennedy government,
and it's the reason so many COIN
programs pass for charity. For,
according to the Dictionary of
United States Military Terms for
Joint Usage, issued February 1,
1964, by the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
counterinsurgency is "those
military, paramilitary, political,
economic, psychological, and civic
actions taken by a government to
defeat the subversive insurgency."
Faced with so coordinated and
global a strategy, the question of
encouraging or prohibiting
counterinsurgency depends less on
the niceties of particular programs
than on one's attitude toward
outside intervention or on a
choice between a given regime and
its "subversive insurgents." At the
very least, intelligent men should
come to expect that militiary
intervention of one kind or
another will often follow on the
heels of SRI-style economic
expansion.
As proof we need merely list
those explicitly labeled
counterinsurgency contracts
which SRI coordinates with its
programs of "economic'
development." After all,
approximately a third of SRl's
international project revenue last
year was spent for South and
Southeast Asian projects, mostly
naid for bv the Pentagon.

Even SRl's enemies are quick
to point out what appear to be its
obviously constructive activities in
the physical and social sciences.
But, as with other SRI activities,
they are not always what they
seem.
No one needs be told air
pollution is of serious concern in
California, particularly in the Bay
Area, which is cursed with the
third most critical air pollution

problem in the U.S. SRI began
research on air pollution almost
immediately after its inception,
but SRl's smog research differs
from its defense work only in
degree: instead of conducting
research aimed at protecting
people from air pollution, SRI
gathers information which helps
polluting industries escape public
condemnation and more stringent
regulations.
In 1949 and 1952, SRI joined
the California Institute of
Technology, UCLA, and USC in
sponsoring two symposiums on air
pollution at which scientists,
industrial representatives, and
government leaders were treated
to lectures dealing with smog
analysis and detection methods.
But SRI smog research at the time
was primarily funded by business
organizations from industries
among the prime pollutors, such
as . the Western Oil and Gas
Association.
The November, 1948, issue of
SRl's news bulletin, Research for
Industry, cites a survey of people
in Los Angeles, the greater
'number of whom attributed smog
to industry. But an investigation
at that time under the direction of
SRl's supervisor of air pollution
research dealt only with the
impact of the Los Angeles climate
on smog.
More recently, when pollution
from the Pacific Gas and Electric
(PG&E) plant at Moss Landing
aroused a furor among citizens in
Monterey County, PG&E brought
in the head of SRl's
Environmental Research
Department, Elmer Robinson, as
one expert witness. PG&E's
president, Shermer Sibley, sits on
the board of SRI, as do four other
past or present directors of PG&E
or its subsidiaries. Robinson is a
member and past chairman of the
Bay Area Air Pollution Control
District (BAAPCD) advisory
council, an agency which, by
failing to enforce existing
pollution regulations, often seems
to be working more for the
pollutor than the consumer. Much
of Robinson's research at SRI is
sponsored directly by the very
industries the BAAPCD is
expected to control.
Robinson's testimony
concerning PG&E's Moss Landing
plant exonerated the company
and contradicted that of biologists
from Stanford's Hopkins Marine
Station in Pacific Grove and
scientists from UC Santa Cruz and
Monterey Peninsula College.
According to Ed Munson, Air
Pollution Control Officer for
Monterey County, the PG&E
plant dumps more nitrogen
dioxide into the air than all the
power plants in Los Angeles
county. He says PG&E is
responsible for ninety per cent of
the nitrogen dioxide pollution in
the Monterey region, which harms
crops and causes emphysema.
Smog and Gas
A research project Robinson
carried out with Robert Robbins
is reported in the December,
1968, issue of the SRI Journal.
Sponsored by the American
Petroleum Institute, it exonerates
industrial pollutors by
emphasizing natural sources of
pollution, such as swamp gas,
decaying organic matter, and
vegetation. Robinson overlooks
the hydrocarbons and sulfur
dioxide which are chief factors in
air pollution and products of oil
refineries.
At both the University and
SRI, those who do smog research
are often the same men who work
on Chemical and Biological
Warfare (CBW). Robinson worked
with SRl's CBW-men, William C.
Thuman and Richard D. Cadle, on
building an important piece of
equipment for their work, the SRI
aerosol camera. In a 1954 article
in the Biological Photography
Association Journal, he described
its importance: "The armed forces
may use aerosols defensively as in
smoke screens or offensively in

chemical or biological warfare."
SRl's social science
contributions are also often
thought to be beneficial. These
began with a 1952 conference
bringing the SRI Associates
together to discuss application of
social science to industrial
problems. Dean Ernest C.
Arbuckle of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business
explained that "in the near future,
it is possible that private business
may take over from government
the task of guarding the humane
aspects of our industrial
civilization."
What this turns out to be is
guarding the boss from his
employees. SRI publications
document frequent calls for
psychological research on worker
morale, methods of screening job
applicants, of increasing worker
efficiency, perfecting on the job
training, and the like. Social
science at SRI does not generally
provide models for effective labor
organizing, police control boards,
or self determination by students.
In fact, SRl's education
research frequently appears to
channel, rather than free,
students. Dr. Howard Vollmer of
the SRI research staff wrote in the
Daily last fall that "the shift to
social problems has taken place in
the Institute in matters like
educational, urban, and minority
problems"—problems by the way,
which industry and
government-funded researchers
are most likely to see as
counterinsurgency affairs. "Funds
from the Defense Department,"
Vollmer said, "are concentrated
around behavioral and social areas
and primarily concerned with
improving efficiency and job
satisfaction."
BART Men
SRI development of designs for
urban mass transit, too, seems
more likely to serve the interests
of the industrialists on the board
than the people on trolleys. SRI
did some of the feasibility surveys
which preceded the creation of
the Bay Area Rapid Transit
system (BART). The push for
BART began in the early fifties
when a group of SF businessmen
connected to the Blyth-Zellerbach
Committee initiated the studies.
The committee, a corporate group
supporting urban renewal, was
formed by Charles Blyth and J. D.
Zellerbach, both founding
directors of SRI. Blyth was also a
Stanford trustee.
As a part of the development
of a downtown San Francisco
business center, BART was to
enable suburbanites to commute
to work; but beside providing
inadequate service to city dwellers
(it avoids Hunters Point and
bypasses the Oakland ghettoes),
BART financing will be a burden
to those least able to pay by
increasing the tax burden and by
raising property values along the
route.
These studies, and others
regarding plans for school
desegregation, protection of
business investments in the city,
"reverse commuter" facilities, and
the development of Oakland, raise
much the same questions as other
SRI research: do we approach the
problems from the standpoint of
business or from that of those the
research ultimately effects?
What we mean by constructive
research is not research framed by
one self-seeking interest group,
which happens to have the money
to fund it. The inference can be
drawn that all too frequently the
SRI researcher, under pressure to
sell a product, has approached a
problem uncritically and unable
to separate himself from the view
of his contractor. Unfortunately
this is characteristic of most SRI
activities. The quality of work at
the Institute, particularly in the
social sciences, declines as it aims
at preserving the status quo rather
than meeting people's needs.
We have discussed some
research touching upon the

critical problems of cities but
which has not been chosen by the
people of those cities. Such work
is at the least irrelevant and at the
most, detrimental to the needs of
people. Guiding Institute research
policy both to encourage
self-sponsored research rather
than work responding to a
fluctuating market and to increase
the "relevance" of such work to
all people is important in
redirecting policy of the future
Institute.
While redirecting policy is
more difficult than restricting
research, we must take steps in
that direction. Obviously those
people affected should be asked
about the needs. To ensure that
SRI meet the changing social
needs, we must institute
continuous review and
reinterpretation of policy. Only
this way can we guarantee the
future "benefits" of research, and
a critical approach to solutions. *
PART IV. SOME GUIDELINES
FOR THE FUTURE
Within this framework of
critical interchange and closer
control, it is clear that the
university community must
develop guidelines and
mechanisms to insure a new
evolution in SRl's development
and in its research programs.
There needs to be some
institutional means by which the
university community can
monitor and direct this evolution.
We recommend that the form
which such an institutional
mechanism takes be one which
can more accurately reflect the
desires of an evolving community.
One example might be a review
body made up of elected faculty
and students with knowledgeable
trustees, their appointed
administrators and groups
affected by potential research «»■
serving as advisors.
Such a body would not provide
day-to-day administration for the
institute but rather the following:
1. Do projective planning for
SRI as a whole, including the
general direction of research, and
2. Insure that SRI research is
within "moral limits" and is of
"optimum social value," and
3. Monitor the technical
quality of the staff and of the
research.
The technical quality of the
staff can best be monitored
through a good personnel hiring
procedure. The technical quality
of the research may perhaps best
be monitored through low level
review committees in conjunction
with relevant university
departments.
The function of the second
activity is to begin weeding out
the morally objectionable and
undesirable research which is
being carried on at SRI. At-*,
present there are at least three
kinds of research which seem to
fall into this category and have
been the object of widespread
community protest:
1) Chemical, biological or
radiological warfare research.
2) Cou n terinsurgency
research.
3) Research directly related to
the war in Southeast Asia.
We reject the contention that
any research the U.S. government
desires to fund is acceptable and
that questions of morality and
political responsibility must be
directed toward the government
policy guiding the uses to which
the research will be put. To accept
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand, as SRI has done, is to
actively assist in the prosecution
of government foreign policy in
that area. To accept the work is to
endorse the policy. If one rejects
the policy one must reject the
work. Neutrality is impossible.
Because many of these
activities are classified or secret it
is difficult to phrase with
precision, rules which could be
counted on to prohibit thesp
activities. One can only suggest a
tentative formulation:
1) SRI shall not embark upon
any research which is designed or
likely to lead to the development
of information or theories useful
to the conduct of chemical,
biological or radiological warfare.
Nor shall SRI engage in any basic
chemical, biological or nuclear
research supported by those
military agencies responsible for
the development of CBR weapons
systems. Examples include:
development of weapon delivery
systems, techniques of utilization,
basic research on carriers or
strains of diseases, meteorological
studies for use in dissemination
techniques, "riot" control
applications, etc.
2) SRI shall not take any
contract which has as a purpose
advising on counterinsurgency,
participating in counter
insurgency, or developing the
capability for counterinsurgency
anywhere in the world both
within the continental United
States and beyond its borders.
Examples include: estimation of
social, economic or military
requirements and methods in
counter-guerri 1 1 a and
"pacification" programs,
development of specialized
techniques such as electronics
intrusion detection devices,
studies of population control
programs such as the "strategic
hamlet" plan, and ethnographies
of "unstable areas." The
operations of the RSSC (Regional
Security Study Center) located in
Bangkok should be immediately
ceased.
3) During the continuation of
the war in Vietnam, Thailand,
Laos, and Cambodia or in the
event of hostilities involving the
United States elsewhere in
Southeast Asia, SRI shall not take
contracts from any agency of the
government or from any
firm in contractual relationship
with the federal government
which requires any studies or
efforts substantially related to the
war. Examples include: any of the
above related to the war,
collection of data on village
organization or political support
in Southeast Asia, land reform for
AID, logistical support studies.
Because of the difficulty in
interpeting and applying such
rules it is imperative that the
system of review and monitoring
include a constant exchange
between the review body and the
community at large. Regular
publication of policy and
contracts is one approach. It is
quite conceivable that such a
body might fall rapidly out of
touch with the community it is
supposed to represent. There must
thus be the provision of
mechanisms whereby not only the
members of the review body
-puld call the general direction or
specific projects into question,
3ut also that any member of the
community can bring his views
jefore the review body as a whole
ind before the community. It is
jnthinkable that views remain
;tatic and that what is acceptable
;oday will be acceptable
omorrow and for this reason the
jossibility of change must be
nstitutionalized.
One of the reasons why the
Jniversity is going through a crisis
oday is that large parts of the
ommunity no longer support
esearch that was once quite
cceptable and that the only
legal" line of action open to
hem is through the Board of
'rustees —less-than-candid
""rustees who cling to the
• utdated view of University
ovemment as a hierarchical, top
own, authoritarian structure and
/ho refuse to recognize the need
or community decision-making
•■.vital University issues.
It seems clear to us that given
le concerns of many of the
tanford community there should
e no SRI research in the three
reas outlined above and that
jii.munity control over Institute

policy and activities be established
so that the Institute can function
in a manner more harmonious
with an evolving University.
There are two further problems
related to selecting the best
guidance for SRI research which
have been ignored in the
preceding discussion.
1) The first is the question
of adequate representation in
the review body. Aside from
the question of whether any
group can be represented by
one or a few of its number
there is the harder question of
whether or not the right groups
will be represented at all. For
example, what of the
monitoring of socio-economic
or political research on urban
areas—should not city dwellers
as a class of those most
affected by the research have
some say in what kinds of
work will be done? In
particular, with respect to the
biggest urban problem: that of
slums, poverty and racial
ghettoes—should not the poor
white and black slum and
ghetto dweller have some part
in reviewing the types of
research done by an
organization such as SRI,
rather than just leaving the
choice to corporations or city
governments who will pay for
what they want? How can one
hope to insure that research is
not performed which is
detrimental to the urban poor?
How can they be represented?
Do "informed intellectuals"
have the right to speak for
them? Or should members of
their number be sought out?
Another, more difficult
example is that of SRI
international research affecting
peoples in other countries. In
the past SRI has been guided
by the "foreign policy of the
United States government."
This has meant that SRI has
unquestioningly assumed that
the best interests of the
Vietnamese people are
represented by the Saigon
government since it is an ally
of the U.S. and is thus an
adequate judge of the value of
contracts affecting those
people. Is this an acceptable
method of determining the
social desirability of their
research? We think not.
Even when SRI has sought
counsel from non
governmental foreign nationals
about the desirability of their
work from the local viewpoint
they have turned to corporate
leaders, "key business
executives," as the most
authoratative representatives of
the interests of the local
population. Is this a
satisfactory choice? Why not
peasants rather than
industrialists? As much as SRI
claims to be politically neutral
and objective in its
non-military research, we hope
that our arguments make
strikingly clear that here too it
consistently makes political
choices and that its entire
world view is politically
oriented by its close
identification with "free
enterprise."
It is obviously a complex
and difficult problem to find a
method of representation
which best represents the
interests of a majority of the
people of an area to be studied.
Yet it is also just as obvious
that such an effort must be
made and that the present
method be rejected as
unacceptable.
2) The second problem
relates the question of control
to the dynamics of a
productive research
organization. In theory a
not-for-profit research institute
can allow its personnel to
generate exploratory research
because it is not heavily tied
down to the constraints and

values of the marketplace.
Thus one can, by picking
professional personnel with
capabilities in certain areas
expect to expand imaginatively
in those areas with little
guidance or control. In fact,
SRI has not used its potential
to sponsor exploratory
research to the best advantage.
Rather SRI has followed a
policy of rapid growth and
hence has not freed enough
funds for much in-house
sponsored research.
Furthermore, SRI has very
much "followed the market"
in this effort to expand
(witness the evolution
described in part II). Finally
while the SRI management has
encouraged expansion into new
areas "where the money is,"
such as the Naval Warfare
Research Center in response to
the availability of funds from
the Defense Department, or
the Agricultural Research
Center in Pasadena backed by
California agri-business, it has
not encouraged self-directed
exploratory expansion into
areas such as urban problems
or natural resource
preservation until very
recently.
But not only should a
not-for-profit organization
realize its potential of
self-directed research, but to
do so it needs to allow
considerable freedom to the
individual researcher in order
for him to contribute most
creatively within the context
of a research team.
Without freedom from
undue "bring the money in"
pressure researchers can't be
creative or critical. Without
freedom from financial
pressure, project managers may
take on contracts that are
undesirable, unethical or
beyond capability. Without
freedom to question
ideological assumptior s, the
research product m«y be
morally objectionab e or
turned to nefarious uses SRI
policies often seem to be
directly detrimental to the
functioning of such freedom
and, while unusual, cases of
coercion and pressure being
applied on low-ranking
personnel to get them to work
on projects for which they
have no interest have been
brought to our attention.
Such freedom, of course, in
no way inhibits the setting of
overall research policy and the
determination of the criteria
under which research will be
accepted or rejected.
There is another area of
concern over the present
relationship between SRI and
the University: a financial one.
SRI has an annual
discretionary cash flow
estimated somewhere between
$1.5 million and $4 million. As
owner of SRI, Stanford could
appropriate these funds for use
elsewhere. However,
considering that the University
to date has refused even to
allow SRI to engage in
endowment fund raising for
fear of conflict with the
University's fund raising
efforts, and considering that
the lack of free endowment has
been one of the principal
reasons why SRI has not been
able to expand self-directed
exploratory research, it would
be hard to justify such
expropriation if the expansion
of such types of research is
desired.
A View of the Future
Central to the forgoing
discussion is our feeling that
closer ties between the University
and SRI can be of considerable
advantage to the University.
Closer ties can also be seen as
beneficial to SRI, if one refuses to
visualize the SRI of the future as a
market-following and

profit-seeking, "not-for-profit"
institution.
If we accept the types of
controls suggested on some SRI
research and the idea of
University guidance to overall
institute policy, we feel that we
can look forward to the institute
becoming less and less dependent
on the market, on private
enterprise and on defense
contracts, and more and more
responsive to the desires of the
University community to move in
the direction of more exploratory
applied research on critical social
and economic problems. One
could expect less study of helping
corporations expand abroad and
more study of economic
development. One could expect
less work for the timber industries
and agri-business and more work
on natural resource preservation
and environmental studies. One
could expect less work for those
corporations which have proved
incapable or undesirous of solving
the urban problems of
unemployment and housing and
more research on programs to
eliminate poverty and misery
through new approaches, such as
governmental decentralization and
cooperative enterprise.
There can be little doubt that
if through new administrative
connection and cooperative
efforts, Universitv departments
became more influential in the
formulating and execution of SRI
research programs, new directions
would result. Such cooperation
would not only provide greater
resources and research
opportunities for University
faculty but also give the staff of
SRI the possibility of being more
closely associated with the
University. As stated much earlier
there is no suggestion being made
either that SRI personnel be
assimilated into the University, or
that faculty drop their teaching
functions. Rather, new and closer
ties such as those mentioned
provide the opportunity for
members of each institution to
benefit from the skills and
knowledge of members of the
other. One might expect joint
appointments to increase and one
would certainly expect the
educational and professional
opportunities for students,
faculty, and research workers to
expand considerably.
Thus far we have only
addressed ourselves to the
questions of the need for some
kind of University community
control over SRI and to three
probable areas of immediate
concern. We have tried to define a
structure, however, which
institutionalizes the means of
change and feel compelled to
suggest that in the future there
may be other, broader areas of
concern to the University
community which may strike
more to the heart of the institute
than the limited concerns
expressed until now. For example,
the question has already been
raised in the community-at-large
whether applications of
technology for military and
industrial clients, of restricted
access and having no educational
function should be part of a
University's activities in any way,
even if they now benefit a small
part of the University. It is the
very real probability of changing
concerns and shifts in emphasis
which have led us to suggest the
structural changes that we have.
For us, it is within the framework
of a climate of continually
evolving criticism and active
community participation in
decision-making, that the future
of the University must lie.
The time is rapidly passing
where students are content to
leave the direction of their lives to
others, where faculty close their
eyes to the real social and
economic roles of the University
and where captains of industry are
allowed to define those roles and
to guide the course and

development of the University.
A new direction is being
demanded of the University. Its
present role is under study and
new roles are being defined and
sought. If a mechanism is created
which allows, indeed encourages,
criticism and change of SRl's
policies and programs, that
institute, in an altered form, can
be a valuable asset to a University
seeking a new, creative role in
society.
APPENDIX
A Short History of
Community Conflict
over SRI
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee and this report—as
well as the student occupation of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the trustee's
moratorium on new CBW
contracts at SRl—are results of
some years of research, education,
and agitation by students on the
left at Stanford.
Concern about SRl's war work
began in 1965 with the discovery
by members of the Stanford
Committee for Peace in Vietnam
of two CBW contracts being
performed by the Institute. The
contracts were revealed in the
newsletter of the Graduate
Coordinating Committee, a
political group first organized in
late 1964 and the grandfather of
the Stanford left.
More detailed studies of
Stanford/SRl's war research were
published in the spring of 1967 in
Resistance, the journal of
Stanford's short-lived, student-run
experimental college, The
Experiment. These articles were
the first to argue that the
university—and particularly
SRl—was in fact deeply involved
in the policy and performance of
the Southeast Asian War, and the
point brought hot debate,
particularly after Experiment
members covered the campus with
posters of the trustees which read
"We Accuse."
As a part of a nationwide
Spring Mobilization against the
War, about 150 students from
Stanford and the local high
schools marched on SRl's Menlo
Park facilities on April 14, 1967.
In late January, 1968, SRI was
revealed to be doing extensive
counterinsurgency research in
Thailand by the Peninsula
Observer, a newspaper edited by
recent alumni of Stanford and
The Experiment. The Observer
later revealed SRl's
counterinsurgency research in
Peru and Honduras, too.
Most of the campus, of course,
was introduced to SRI
counterinsurgency and CBW by
Through the Looking Glass, SDS's
fall quarter "radical guide to
Stanford," which was essentially
the outcome of a summertime
research group of students and
townspeople meeting as a class of
the Midpeninsula Free University.
Demands Tacked on Door
On October 8, soon after the
quarter began, SDS tacked its
demands to the trustee's door,
calling for an end to "all military
and economic projects and
operations with Southeast Asis."
On October 9, SRI President
Charles Anderson rejected the
demands, explaining that
government sponsored research
"is in the public interest."
On October 10, SDS made an
October 14 deadline for its
demands, and Acting President
Glaser announced the formation
of the Stanford-SRI Study
Committee. The 14th came and
went; so did SDS to SRI.
The SRI committee first met
on November 14, but by
December campus
opinion—informed by the Daily,
SDS, and the Resistance—was at
least one factor in bringing
Student Body President Denis
Hayes to request of SRI directors
that they not commit the
Institute to "any further
long-term research" in CBW or
research "in support of the
American military effort in S.E.
Asia." SRI President Anderson
refused him December 12. A
similar proposal that, during the
committee's deliberations, SRI
not enter into nor renew contracts
for the S.E. Asian War, CBW, or
counterinsurgency, was brought
up by Committee member Barton
Bernstein and discussed for a
month. But it never made it to the
vote, after Anderson told the
committee SRI expected to take
on no new major contracts.
When the January 28 San Jose
Mercury revealed that SRI had
just accepted a "top secret $1.8
million contract to help Thailand
improve government operations
and fight Communist guerrillas,"
SDS celebrated SRI veracity by
running up the flag of the
National Liberation Front. It had
previously called for the
resignation of three trustees from
war industry, demanded that
military electronics research be
discontinued in the University and
SRI, and reiterated its other
demands.
On January 14 some 50
students had carried their
demands personally to an
on-campus trustee meeting, only
to be met with adjournment and
later tried for "disruption," found
guilty, and fined. Most, refusing
to pay the fines, were barred from
registering.
On January 29, a hundred
students occupied the Applied
Electronics Laboratory briefly
and then moved on to an SRI
annex in the Industrial Park,
where they were barred from
entering.
At an AAUP sponsored forum
on SRI in February, an SRI
employee announced that he had
been "coerced" into contract
work to which he objected.
And on March 11, in a
student-trustee forum first called
by the January 14 defendants but
finally sponsored by the
University Advisory Committee,
some 1400 members of the
university community heard
Trustee William Hewlett again
maintain that having SRI perform
services "for the United States of
America" is not a political
decision. They also heard the five
trustees unanimously refuse to
lobby with their colleagues for an
open meeting at which they
would discuss the SRI committee
report and recommendations.
When the trustees asked the
audience whose request it was for
such a meeting, they were met by
a roar "OURS!"
Coalition Demands
Subsequent to the March 11
meeting the "SRI —Coalition" was
formed by community members
concerned with the future of the
SRI-Stanford relationship. On
April 3, the Coalition together
with a dozen other community
groups including SDS and the
UCM called a town meeting to
discuss the growing conflict
between community concern and
trustee intransigence.
Out of that meeting of some
800 people came the following
demands:
1) We demand that the
trustees discontinue all plans for
severance of SRI from the
University (with or without a
restrictive convenance), and that
instead SRI be brought under
tighter control by the University,
and that guidelines be established
for socially acceptable research to
be directly applied to SRI and the
rest of the Stanford Community.
2) We demand that all research
in the following areas be stopped
as of April 9 and that no new
contracts in these areas be
accepted:
1) All classified research at
Stanford and SRI,
2) All research classified
and not, at Stanford and
SRI in the following areas:
a) Chemical and biological
warfare (CBW),

b) Counterinsurgency at
home and abroad, c) All
research in support of the
war against the peoples of
Vietnam, Laos, Thailand;
3) We demand a special
meeting of the Stanford Trustees
during the week of April 21, that
this be an open meeting in which
anyone from the Stanford-Palo
Alto community may participate
in the discussion and observe the
discussion.
The decision of the Trustees to
not react to most of the demands,
moving only to put a moritorium
on new CBW contracts and to
promise closed hearings with
"selected" witnesses, led to a new
community meeting April 9.
There, after several hours of
discussion, the people voted to sit
in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in order to halt the
war research ignored by the
trustees.
Our statement is dedicated to
the courageous students and
faculty who, deeply concerned
with Stanford's involvement in
Southeast Asia, occupied tfie
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
in order to put a stop to a
significant part of that
involvement.
We wish to thank the
innumerable people who have
contributed research and articles
on the operations of the
SRI-Stanford complex. The
on-going work done by David
Ransom and the people of the
Peninsula Observer, and last
summer's Free University research
seminar provided much of the
background data for this report.
