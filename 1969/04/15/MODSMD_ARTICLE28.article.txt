April 14, 1969
I am releasing the attached
copy of the "Report of
Stanford-SRI Study Committee,"
prepared by an ad hoc Study
Committee of students and
faculty under the chairmanship of
Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The urgency of the situation
on campus has caused me to make
this report available in this form
to the faculty, students, and
university officers concerned.
Making it available in this
manner has precluded study of
the report by me and therefore I
cannot say at this time whether or
not I agree with any of its
statements or conclusions.
Kenneth S. Pitzer,
President

distributed to the Academic
Council and some staff of
Stanford University.)

REPORT OF STANFORD
SRI STUDY
COMMITTEE
I. INTRODUCTION
The Stanford-SRI Study
Committee was appointed on
October 31, 1968 by then Acting
President Robert J. Glaser "to
explore in detail the relationships
between Stanford University and
the Stanford Research Institute
(SRI)." The Committee was
composed of five faculty members
nominated to the President by the
Committee on Committees of the
Academic Senate: Barton J.
Bernstein (History), William K.
Linvill (Engineering-Economic
Systems), David S. Nivison
(Philosophy), Kenneth E. Scott
(Law) and Ezra Solomon
(Business School); five student
members' nominated to the
President by the President of
ASSU: Anne C. Bauer (Political
Science), Harry M. Cleaver
(Economics), Nick P. Falk
(Business School), G. Victor Hori
(Philosophy) and J. Patrick
McMahon (Communications); and
two members selected by the
President: Frank B. W.
Hawkinshire (Education) and
Richard W. Lyman (Provost).
The major question to which
the Committee was charged to
direct its attention was whether
the present relationship between
Stanford and SRI should be
maintained. The Committee was
also directed to consider whether,
if the relationship were to be
maintained, existing arrangements
should be altered. It was sugested
that, in considering these
questions, the Committee might
review (a) the general nature of
the activities carried on by SRI
and their impact, if any, on the
University, (b) the reasons that
led to the establishment of SRI in
1946 by the University and the
reasons why the relationship was
organized as it was, and (c) the
financial implications of the
present relationship and any
implications of an alteration of
the relationship for the
University.
The Committee was requested
to render its report by April 1,
1969, a date that because it
coincided with an end-of-quarter
examination period was
subsequently extended to April
15, 1969 in order to permit a full
participation by the student
members in the final portion of
the Committee's work and
preparation of its report. It was
pointed out at the outset that
although the Committee's report
would be rendered to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, action on the
Committee's recommendations
would be the responsibility of the
University's Board of Trustees.

In carrying out its charge, the
Committee sought a considerable
amount of information from SRI,
and wishes to express its
appreciation for the time and
effort devoted to our needs by
President Charles A. Anderson,
Vice-President Rudolph K.
Brunsvold and other officers and
staff of SRI. The questionnaire
which the Committee directed to
SRI on December 31, 1968 and
the responses received from SRI
on January 16 and January 31,
1969, together with documents
cited in this report and other
written material submitted to or
collected by the Committee, have
been deposited in Meyer Memorial
Library and are available to any
member of the University
Community at the reserve desk.
Part II of this report attempts to
organize and present portions of
this information which are of
general value in understanding the
nature of SRl's activities and the
different dimensions of its
relationship to the University.
In addition, the Committee
held numerous discussions with
various persons connected with
both the University and SRI. A
questionnaire was sent by the
Committee to selected members
of the Stanford faculty, to obtain
outside informed opinion on some
of the issues under consideration.
A public hearing at the University
was held on December 5, 1968
and a meeting with the senior
administration and staff of SRI
was held on March 24, 1969. The
Stanford Chapter of the American
Association of University
Professors conducted a public
forum on SRI and Stanford's
relations to it on February 6,
1969, in Memorial Auditorium.
The Committee also undertook
to draw on somewhat analogous
experiences at other institutions,
including the decision in 1968 by
Cornell University to sell Cornell
Aeronautical Laboratory and the
decision in 1967 to merge the
Mellon Institute into the Carnegie
Institute of Technology.
Lacking any staff or resources,
however, beyond the time that
the persons composing it were
able to devote, the Committee
was not able to pursue a number
of pertinent matters beyond the
preliminary level of analysis set
forth in this report. The
Committee regards this as a
regrettably narrow constraint in
studying issues of substantial
complexity and magnitude for
both the University and SRI, and
would urge that more attention be
given to this need in the creation
of future ad hoc committees
charged with reporting on matters
of major import.
Within its limited means, the
Committee did attempt to
evaluate the various aspects of the
present relationship between the
University and SRI, and this is set
forth in Part 111 of this report. It
had been consistently the plan
and intention of the Committee
to produce a single report, setting
forth in a systematic way a variety
of points of view and arguments
and ending with a description of
the positions favored by the
different members. In the last
week and day of the Committee's
work, however, this proved
impossible to attain. The various
parts of the report and separate
statements which follow,
therefore, should be understood
as not necessarily representing the
views of anyone not indicated to
be a signatory. In particular, the
minority statement has not been
seen by the other members of the
Committee; those signing the
minority statement did have
access to and an influence upon
drafts of the other parts of the
report. On the final day of the

Committee's work, the signatories
of the minority statement
indicated that they wished to
withdraw association with the
contents of all portions of the
report save their own.
11. HISTORY AND
DEVELOPMENT
OF SRI
A. Formation
Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) was formed in 1946 by the
trustees of Stanford University in
cooperation with a group of West
Coast industrialists. The Institute
grew out of what was perceived to
be both a need and an
opportunity for an organization
to provide a wide range of
research capabilities for growing
Western business. There were
already a number of such
organizations in the East (e.g.,
Arthur D. Little, Inc., Battelle
Memorial Institute, Armour
Research Foundation) and the
idea that useful results could
accrue from an organized
approach to industrial research
had been spreading for over a
decade. The end of the war and
the economic boom which
followed gave added impetus to
the creation of such an
organization in the West.
In 1945 two Stanford
professors (Robert E. Swain and
Philip A. Leighton) and a
Stanford alumnus (H. Dudley
Swim) were appointed as a
University committee to study the
possibility of creating a research
institute under University
auspices. The considerations that
they weighed at the time are
worth setting forth, not only for
the light shed on the reasons that
led to establishing SRI but also
for assistance in evaluating that
decision two decades later:
"Arguments for Stanford
sponsorship:
a. A research institute
connected with a university has
educational functions. It trains
men through giving them an
opportunity to work, under
expert direction, on actual
industrial problems. Its staff
members may hold faculty status
and give lectures or courses in the
University. It improves the
usefulness of faculty members as
teachers, through improving their
understanding of industrial
problems and industrial needs.
b. A research institute is a
means of supporting basic
research, both by its own staff
and by grants and fellowships to
the university.
c. It is a source of income.
d. It improves contacts and
relations between the university
and industry.
e. It provides the organization
and means for attracting and
accepting large government
contracts.
112. It would give the University
a leading part in the industrial and
regional development of the
Pacific Coast.
g. Both the physical location
of Stanford and its standing as a
University are favorable factors.
h. Research has come of age.
Its social importance is now
recognized, even by the man on
the street. Large scale industrial
and government support is not
only in prospect, it is here. This
support will be chiefly for
projects which are more highly
organized and on a larger scale
than the highly individualized
manner in which most University
research has been carried on in the
past. While opportunity for
complete individual freedom in
research must be preserved at all
costs, the new emphasis on
research, particularly on organized
interrelated projects, must be
recognized and a mechanism
developed to meet and take

advantage of this emphasis. The
University that does not do this
will be left on the shelf.
Arguments against Stanford
sponsorship:
a. The primary objective of an
industrial research institute must
be to serve industry. Its primary
interest is the application of
knowledge. The primary interest
of a University is the advancement
of knowledge, through basic
research and education. These two
primary interests cannot be mixed
without loss to both. Can
Stanford accept the commitments
involved in sponsoring an
Industrial Research Institute
without reducing its level as a
University? Is the gain worth the
loss?
b. Scores of second and third
rate colleges and universities are
planning research institutes. Many
of these ventures will fail. Will this
create a situation which is best
avoided by remaining out of the
field, or should the field be
entered with such strength and
aggressiveness as to insure
leadership and success?"
These "three musketeers"
submitted their report to
University President Tresidder on
December 21, 1945. That report
called for the creation of
"Stanford Research Institute,"
separately incorporated as a
non-profit corporation but under
complete control by the
University including an
arrangement
"whereby the Institute would
pay, say, 50% of its annual
earnings, after the first three
years of operation, to the
University in consideration of
the use of the name 'Stanford, 1
the sponsorship by the
University, and the use of the
University's facilities. This
would also afford a settled
policy whereby one-half of the
earnings would go to the
research and/or general funds
of the University and the other
half would be 'plowed back'
into the development of the
Institute."
About the same time a San
Francisco industrialist, Atholl
Mcßean, had asked Dr. Henry
Heald, President of the Illinois
Institute of Technology, to study
the idea of establishing a research
foundation in California to serve
the Pacific Coast area. Heald
presented his conclusions to a
group of business executives on
January 24, 1946, in San
Francisco. His report was very
positive: "I, therefore, suggest
that the industrialists interested in
the establishment of a research
organization ask Stanford
University to organize it, provide
the University with moral support
for the project, and arrange to
provide an initial gift of $500,000
to be used to finance operations,
space and equipment ..." About
a month after the Health report,
the University trustees decided in
principle that Stanford would
found a research institute.
By October 24, 1946 the
Articles of Incorporation, or
charter, had been drawn up and it
was filed on November 6th. Under
the charter the University
Trustees were designated the sole
general members of the
corporation and given the power
to appoint the Board of Directors
of SRI. They met for that purpose
on December 13th and appointed
the first eleven-man Board of
Directors of SRI. When those
eleven men met on the Stanford
campus for the first time on
January 8, 1947, Stanford
Research Institute had become a
reality.
B. Objectives
The objectives of the different
groups involved in the founding of

SRI were varied. One dominant
theme was that of providing a
valuable service to business and
thereby assisting West Coast
industrial development. In their
report to Dr. Tresidder the "Three
Musketeers" recommended
against including the term
"industrial" in the name as too
limiting but did think it desirable
to advertise its creation as "The
Far West's first industrial research
institute."
Heald in his report to Mcßean
was very explicit:
"The need for a first-class
research organization to serve
Pacific Coast industry seems to
be well established. The rapid
growth of industrial
development to its present
substantial volume plus the
prospect of a continued
increase creates a substantial
demand for such services. Such
an organization can be of real
value in assisting in the
industrial development of the
area."
The University press release of
September 27, 1946, announcing
the formation of SRl,emphasized
this role: "The institute plans to
do the kind of research that
industry itself might do if each
company could set up its own
comprehensive research
organization, supported by the
resources of a great university."
The Articles of Incorporation
state that one purpose of SRI,
among others, is "To promote and
foster the application of science in
the development of commerce,
trade and industry, the discovery
and development of methods for
the beneficial utilization of
natural resources, the
industrialization of the western
United States of America ..."
The initial purpose stated in
SRl's charter, however, is "To
promote the educational purposes
of the Leland Stanford Junior
University by encouraging,
fostering and conducting scientific
investigations and pure and
applied research in the physical,
biological and social sciences,
engineering and the mechanic
arts..." This theme is carried
out by further references to SRI
as intended "to devote its
resources ... to the assistance of
the Leland Stanford Junior
University in the promotion and
extension of learning and
knowledge" and to "provide,
equip and maintain
laboratoriess . . . and to make
such facilities available to the
Leland Stanford Junior University
[and others] for the conduct of
research and investigation."
It seems to have been a general
view at the time that funds for
research within the University
would be sparse and difficult to
obtain, and that an industrial
research organization might afford
some opportunities that would
otherwise be totally lacking. This
would be true only if the Institute
could attract sufficient
commercial business, and it began
with a clear orientation to that
end. Of the first eleven directors
appointed, nine were prominent
in industry (including three
University trustees) and only two
were full-time university people:
the President and Vice-President
of Stanford.
C. Legal Structure of
SRl—University Affiliation
The essential structure of the
Institute's relationship to the
University is laid out in its
Articles of Incorporation:
1) SRI is wholly controlled by
the University: "... the members
of the corporation shall be the
members of the Board of Trustees
of Leland Stanford Junior
University as from time to time
constituted." The Stanford
