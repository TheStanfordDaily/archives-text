# Statements Of Support Back Sit-In Demands
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Support for the demands of the April
3 Coalition poured into the Applied
Electronics Laboratory yesterday from
campus living and eating units.
These statements of support arrived
in addition to the almost 1200 student
"solidarity statements" that have been
turned into the sit-in information
center. The statements, which sit-inners
regard as a form of complicity
statement, read, "I am sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory. Wish
you were here."
All groups support the basic
Coalition demands concerning campus
research and the future of Stanford
Research Institute. Many also supported
the Coalition sit-in tactic, although
many noted that their support lasts only
so long as the sit-in remains non-violent.
Several also called for the Academic
Senate to express its support of the

Coalition demands and to work for their
implementation.
The statement of support came from
groups throughout the campus residence
system. Many units held meetings last
night, with the results as yet
unavailable.
The following campus living and
eating groups have submitted statements
of support:
Fraternities: Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta
Tau Delta, Theta Delta Chi, Beta Chi,
Lambda Nu.
Wilbur: Arroyo, Junipero, Cedro,
Soto.
Stern: Serra, Fremont, Holladay,
Muir.
Others: Grove House, Roble Hall,
Cardenal House in Florence Moore, El
Tigre Eating Club.
Several other campus and
community organizations have added
statements of support. They include:
History and Sociology Graduate
Student Associations, the Concerned
Asian Students of Stanford University,
the Corporate Ministry of the
Mid-Peninsula Christian Ministry, the
International Association, American
Federation of Teachers local 1816, the
Midpeninsula Free University, and the
Peninsula Observer.
Other Colleges Join
In addition, support statements have
been received from student groups at
UCLA, Boston University, University of
California at Berkeley, and the
University of Penn.
In a poll at Roble Hall last night
during dinner, 87 per cent of those
polled called for an end of Stanford and
SRI research into chemical and
biological warfare. Seventy-nine per
cent of the coed, integrated dorm's 270
residents voted.
The students also voted an end to
"techniques of counterinsurgency, both
here and abroad" and to "work in
support of the wars against the peoples
of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand," with
73 per cent and 79 per cent in favor,
respectively.
Eighty-six per cent thought SRI
should be brought under closer control
by the University, while they voted
narrowly in favor for the end of all
classified research at Stanford and SRI.
Further Poll Results
Roble residents further voted 166 to
40 in favor of the question, "Do the
students have the right to help
determine or demand the direction of
SRI?" They turned down the question,
"Should all defense department
contracts be stopped?" by a 2-1 margin.
The tactic of the sit-in, as conducted
up to this time, in order to implement
the Coalition's goals was supported by

58 per cent, and opposed by 35 per
cent. However, 75 per cent think
demonstrators should be punished "not
at all."
The students overwhelmingly feel
that the demands and sit-in have
increased student support; 161 found
increased support, while only 9 think
support has decreased. They voted 138
to 53 that the sit-in should "disband at
a definite time with the threat of
renewing the sit-in."
In fact, 47 per cent of those voting
think the sit-in should end immediately,
with 41 per cent in favor of remaining
until "some demands are met," and
seven per cent advocating remaining
until "all demands are met."
Eighty-seven per cent of the students
rejected the use of violence if the
trustees do not meet the demands.

Several also called for the Academic
Senate to express its support of the

Coalition demands and to work for their
implementation.
The statement of support came from
groups throughout the campus residence
system. Many units held meetings last
night, with the results as yet
unavailable.
The following campus living and
eating groups have submitted statements
of support:
Fraternities: Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta
Tau Delta, Theta Delta Chi, Beta Chi,
Lambda Nu.
Wilbur: Arroyo, Junipero, Cedro,
Soto.
Stern: Serra, Fremont, Holladay,
Muir.
Others: Grove House, Roble Hall,
Cardenal House in Florence Moore, El
Tigre Eating Club.
Several other campus and
community organizations have added
statements of support. They include:
History and Sociology Graduate
Student Associations, the Concerned
Asian Students of Stanford University,
the Corporate Ministry of the
Mid-Peninsula Christian Ministry, the
International Association, American
Federation of Teachers local 1816, the
Midpeninsula Free University, and the
Peninsula Observer.

In addition, support statements have
been received from student groups at
UCLA, Boston University, University of
California at Berkeley, and the
University of Penn.
In a poll at Roble Hall last night
during dinner, 87 per cent of those
polled called for an end of Stanford and
SRI research into chemical and
biological warfare. Seventy-nine per
cent of the coed, integrated dorm's 270
residents voted.
The students also voted an end to
"techniques of counterinsurgency, both
here and abroad" and to "work in
support of the wars against the peoples
of Vietnam, Laos, and Thailand," with
73 per cent and 79 per cent in favor,
respectively.
Eighty-six per cent thought SRI
should be brought under closer control
by the University, while they voted
narrowly in favor for the end of all
classified research at Stanford and SRI.
Further Poll Results
Roble residents further voted 166 to
40 in favor of the question, "Do the
students have the right to help
determine or demand the direction of
SRI?" They turned down the question,
"Should all defense department
contracts be stopped?" by a 2-1 margin.
The tactic of the sit-in, as conducted
up to this time, in order to implement
the Coalition's goals was supported by

58 per cent, and opposed by 35 per
cent. However, 75 per cent think
demonstrators should be punished "not
at all."
The students overwhelmingly feel
that the demands and sit-in have
increased student support; 161 found
increased support, while only 9 think
support has decreased. They voted 138
to 53 that the sit-in should "disband at
a definite time with the threat of
renewing the sit-in."
In fact, 47 per cent of those voting
think the sit-in should end immediately,
with 41 per cent in favor of remaining
until "some demands are met," and
seven per cent advocating remaining
until "all demands are met."
Eighty-seven per cent of the students
rejected the use of violence if the
trustees do not meet the demands.
Support for the demands of the April
3 Coalition poured into the Applied
Electronics Laboratory yesterday from
campus living and eating units.
These statements of support arrived
in addition to the almost 1200 student
"solidarity statements" that have been
turned into the sit-in information
center. The statements, which sit-inners
regard as a form of complicity
statement, read, "I am sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory. Wish
you were here."
All groups support the basic
Coalition demands concerning campus
research and the future of Stanford
Research Institute. Many also supported
the Coalition sit-in tactic, although
