# Statements Of Support Back Sit-In Demands
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Support for the demands of the April
3 Coalition poured into the Applied
Electronics Laboratory yesterday from
campus living and eating units.
These statements of support arrived
in addition to the almost 1200 student
"solidarity statements" that have been
turned into the sit-in information
center. The statements, which sit-inners
regard as a form of complicity
statement, read, "I am sitting in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory. Wish
you were here."
All groups support the basic
Coalition demands concerning campus
research and the future of Stanford
Research Institute. Many also supported
the Coalition sit-in tactic, although
many noted that their support lasts only
so long as the sit-in remains non-violent.
Several also called for the Academic
Senate to express its support of the

Coalition demands and to work for their
implementation.
The statement of support came from
groups throughout the campus residence
system. Many units held meetings last
night, with the results as yet
unavailable.
The following campus living and
eating groups have submitted statements
of support:
Fraternities: Alpha Sigma Phi, Delta
Tau Delta, Theta Delta Chi, Beta Chi,
Lambda Nu.
Wilbur: Arroyo, Junipero, Cedro,
Soto.
Stern: Serra, Fremont, Holladay,
Muir.
Others: Grove House, Roble Hall,
Cardenal House in Florence Moore, El
Tigre Eating Club.
