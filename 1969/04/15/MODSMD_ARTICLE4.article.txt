# Last Proposed Constitution
## Voting Begins On ASSU Revision 
### 
Completely lost in the furor and
excitement over the occupation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory is the
referendum on the adoption of a new
ASSU Constitution.
The referendum, to be voted on in
today's and tomorrow's presidential
primary, puts forth the latest
constitutional offering of student body
president Denis Hayes. As with Hayes'
earlier, unsuccessful, proposed
constitutions, the main thrust of the
document is toward making the
Associated Students and especially the
legislature, a more efficient
organization.
The most important proposal trims
the size of the student legislature (in the
process renaming it the "Senate") from
the present 150 to a more reasonable 41
members, 20 graduates, 2 0
undergraduates and a speaker (or more
formally, a chairman).
One of the major problems under the
existing Constitution is obtaining a
quorum for legislature meetings. With a
quorum of 75 required, and many seats
often standing vacant, getting the
necessary number in one room at one
time has often proved impossible.
Voting By Schools
The proposed Constitution
substitutes voting by schools for the
present voting by campus residence of
affiliation. The document adopts voting
by the Hare System, ordered
preferential balloting.
For example, students in General
Studies would elect eicht

representatives. All students could list
sixteen choices (the extra eight being
alternates in case one of the first eight
resigns or is disqualified). At the same
time, students could list any number
less than or equal to the maximum
allowed.
The Hare System was used in the
election of the Academic Senate and is
generally considered one of the best
ways to ensure a representative
selection.
Variable Fees
The other significant aspect of the
proposed Constitution is the system of
variable student fees, combined with the
requirement to set aside a specific
proportion of the fees to divisional and
school student associations, like, for
instance, the Business School Student
Association.
Every spring students would vote on
the level of fees to be assessed for the
following year. A certain minimum
would be set according to the by-laws to
provide for essential ASSU activities
such as the maintenance of the office.
At a minimum, half of the fees over
and above the minimum level would be
returned to the student associations.
The remaining half would be divided
according to the actions of the senate,
except that no more than 20% of the
ASSU budget could be allocated to any
one student organization without
specific approval in a referendum of all
students. This would have the effect of
cutting The Stanford Daily's subsidy by
some $3000.

It is expected that if students voted
for some fee level substantially above
the present level, the administration
would collect from all students the
additional amount at registration time.
Presently, student fees are included in
the tuition.
Another significant section of the
proposed constitution creates a
committee on nominations to select
student members of committees.
Members of the committee will be
elected by the Senate and the
committee's decisions are subject to
ratification by the Senate. Some
criticism has been directed toward this
committee because of the enormous
importance of the committee.
Another area that has drawn some
criticism is the provision for changes in
the by-laws. The constitution stipulates,
as does the present one, that by-laws
can be changed only after notice has
been given at "the previous regular
meeting." The criticism is that there is
nothing to prevent someone from
introducing an amendment at the
beginning of a meeting and then, with
the cooperation of the chairman,
adjourning the meeting but immediately
reconvening to pass the proposed
change. This has happened numerous
times in the past.
Some Difficulty
Hayes experienced some difficulty in
getting this latest document on the
ballot since the present legislature never
acted on it. Instead, supporters of the

document had to obtain 600 signatures
to place the Constitution on the ballot.
At least two factors contributed to
LASSU's failure to place the proposal
on the ballot, fear of losing their jobs
and a desire to amend the constitution.
Since there was no time to amend it
LASSU instead tabled the whole matter.

as does the present one, that by-laws
can be changed only after notice has
been given at "the previous regular
meeting." The criticism is that there is
nothing to prevent someone from
introducing an amendment at the
beginning of a meeting and then, with
the cooperation of the chairman,
adjourning the meeting but immediately
reconvening to pass the proposed
change. This has happened numerous
times in the past.
Some Difficulty
Hayes experienced some difficulty in
getting this latest document on the
ballot since the present legislature never
acted on it. Instead, supporters of the

document had to obtain 600 signatures
to place the Constitution on the ballot.
At least two factors contributed to
LASSU's failure to place the proposal
on the ballot, fear of losing their jobs
and a desire to amend the constitution.
Since there was no time to amend it
LASSU instead tabled the whole matter.
Completely lost in the furor and
excitement over the occupation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory is the
referendum on the adoption of a new
ASSU Constitution.
The referendum, to be voted on in
today's and tomorrow's presidential
primary, puts forth the latest
constitutional offering of student body
president Denis Hayes. As with Hayes'
earlier, unsuccessful, proposed
constitutions, the main thrust of the
document is toward making the
Associated Students and especially the
legislature, a more efficient
organization.
The most important proposal trims
the size of the student legislature (in the
process renaming it the "Senate") from
the present 150 to a more reasonable 41
members, 20 graduates, 2 0
undergraduates and a speaker (or more
formally, a chairman).
One of the major problems under the
existing Constitution is obtaining a
quorum for legislature meetings. With a
quorum of 75 required, and many seats
often standing vacant, getting the
necessary number in one room at one
time has often proved impossible.
Voting By Schools
The proposed Constitution
substitutes voting by schools for the
present voting by campus residence of
affiliation. The document adopts voting
by the Hare System, ordered
preferential balloting.
For example, students in General
Studies would elect eicht

representatives. All students could list
sixteen choices (the extra eight being
alternates in case one of the first eight
resigns or is disqualified). At the same
time, students could list any number
less than or equal to the maximum
allowed.
The Hare System was used in the
election of the Academic Senate and is
generally considered one of the best
ways to ensure a representative
selection.
Variable Fees
The other significant aspect of the
proposed Constitution is the system of
variable student fees, combined with the
requirement to set aside a specific
proportion of the fees to divisional and
school student associations, like, for
instance, the Business School Student
Association.
Every spring students would vote on
the level of fees to be assessed for the
following year. A certain minimum
would be set according to the by-laws to
provide for essential ASSU activities
such as the maintenance of the office.
At a minimum, half of the fees over
and above the minimum level would be
returned to the student associations.
The remaining half would be divided
according to the actions of the senate,
except that no more than 20% of the
ASSU budget could be allocated to any
one student organization without
specific approval in a referendum of all
students. This would have the effect of
cutting The Stanford Daily's subsidy by
some $3000.

It is expected that if students voted
for some fee level substantially above
the present level, the administration
would collect from all students the
additional amount at registration time.
Presently, student fees are included in
the tuition.
Another significant section of the
proposed constitution creates a
committee on nominations to select
student members of committees.
Members of the committee will be
elected by the Senate and the
committee's decisions are subject to
ratification by the Senate. Some
criticism has been directed toward this
committee because of the enormous
importance of the committee.
Another area that has drawn some
criticism is the provision for changes in
the by-laws. The constitution stipulates,
as does the present one, that by-laws
can be changed only after notice has
been given at "the previous regular
meeting." The criticism is that there is
