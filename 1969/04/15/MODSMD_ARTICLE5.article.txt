# SRI Committee Recommends Severance With Restrictions
## 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The student-faculty committee
examining the relationship between the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and
the University has recommended sale of
SRI. Sale was recommended by nine of
the twelve committee members, with
the remaining three opting for closer
ties between the Institute and the
University.
The nine-to-three margin on the sale
of SRI was not duplicated, however, in
other votes on the conditions to be
attached to the sale.
The committee report is reprinted as
a supplement to today's Daily.
SRI, formed in 1946 as an applied
research affiliate of the University, has
been the focal point of a controversy

for months because of its extensive
involvement in war-related research,
including counter-insurgency and
chemical-biological warfare as well as
other Vietnam-related projects.
According to the committee some ten
per cent, or $6.5 million, of SRl's
annual budget is in these areas.
Seven members of the committee, a
clear majority, favored sale of SRI with
a restrictive covenant which would
prohibit, for a period of twenty years,
all war-related research. This
seven-member group recommends that
SRI be sold essentially to itself, thereby
maintaining its non-profit status. SRI
would pay the University, over a period
of twenty to twenty-five years, some
agreed-upon figure, probably in the
neighborhood of $25 million.
One of the seven, student member
Patrick McMahon, stated that he
favored sale of SRI only if it were
determined, after intense study by legal
experts, that the restrictive covenant
was enforceable.
Committee chairman law professor
Kenneth Scott yesterday voiced his
opinion that the covenant, if it were
carefully drawn up, would be
enforceable.
Two members of the committee,
Scott and Provost Richard Lyman,

concur in the recommendation to sell
SRI but emphasize the difficulty in
drawing up a covenant that makes clear
what constitutes objectionable research.
They also lay out specific uses for the
money that Stanford will realize from
the sale of SRI, including the creation of
an Institute for Public Policy Analysis at
Stanford.
The three committee members who
favor retention of SRI, and increased
control over the types of research
conducted there argue that there is
considerable doubt as to whether the
covenant can be drawn up so as to
control effectively the type of research
at SRI. They argue that the covenant
cannot anticipate all kinds of
objectionable research and that it would
be difficult to obtain a court injunction
against SRI if it accepted questionable
contracts.
The majority report recommends the
creation of a student-faculty committee
to decide on whether specific contracts
are objectionable and whether legal
efforts should be made to terminate or
prevent them.
The three minority committee
members include students Anne Bauer
and Harry Cleaver, who joined in one
minority report. The other minority

member is history professor Barton
Bernstein who wrote a separate
minority report. McMahon, who
tentatively supported the majority
report, would endorse the Cleaver-Bauer
report if he felt a covenant could not be
constructed.
The majority report approaches the
question of SRl's relationship to the
University from two viewpoints, the
moral and institutional.
Concerning the institutional
considerations, the majority state, "The
history of the relationship between the
University and SRI, and the problems to
which it has given rise, indicate that the
two institutions do not have enough by
way of common purpose and program
to warrant any form of joint
operation."
This conclusion is based in part on
the consideration that "SRI is engaged
in a form of business of proven value
and highly technical skills, but one
which has only limited overlap with
University activities, as demonstrated by
the slight extent of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts to
involve the two more closeiy would
probably work to the detriment of
each."

Stanford.
The three committee members who
favor retention of SRI, and increased
control over the types of research
conducted there argue that there is
considerable doubt as to whether the
covenant can be drawn up so as to
control effectively the type of research
at SRI. They argue that the covenant
cannot anticipate all kinds of
objectionable research and that it would
be difficult to obtain a court injunction
against SRI if it accepted questionable
contracts.
The majority report recommends the
creation of a student-faculty committee
to decide on whether specific contracts
are objectionable and whether legal
efforts should be made to terminate or
prevent them.
The three minority committee
members include students Anne Bauer
and Harry Cleaver, who joined in one
minority report. The other minority

member is history professor Barton
Bernstein who wrote a separate
minority report. McMahon, who
tentatively supported the majority
report, would endorse the Cleaver-Bauer
report if he felt a covenant could not be
constructed.
The majority report approaches the
question of SRl's relationship to the
University from two viewpoints, the
moral and institutional.
Concerning the institutional
considerations, the majority state, "The
history of the relationship between the
University and SRI, and the problems to
which it has given rise, indicate that the
two institutions do not have enough by
way of common purpose and program
to warrant any form of joint
operation."
This conclusion is based in part on
the consideration that "SRI is engaged
in a form of business of proven value
and highly technical skills, but one
which has only limited overlap with
University activities, as demonstrated by
the slight extent of interaction that has
spontaneously occurred. Attempts to
involve the two more closeiy would
probably work to the detriment of
each."
The student-faculty committee
examining the relationship between the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) and
the University has recommended sale of
SRI. Sale was recommended by nine of
the twelve committee members, with
the remaining three opting for closer
ties between the Institute and the
University.
The nine-to-three margin on the sale
of SRI was not duplicated, however, in
other votes on the conditions to be
attached to the sale.
The committee report is reprinted as
a supplement to today's Daily.
SRI, formed in 1946 as an applied
research affiliate of the University, has
been the focal point of a controversy

for months because of its extensive
involvement in war-related research,
including counter-insurgency and
chemical-biological warfare as well as
other Vietnam-related projects.
According to the committee some ten
per cent, or $6.5 million, of SRl's
annual budget is in these areas.
Seven members of the committee, a
clear majority, favored sale of SRI with
a restrictive covenant which would
prohibit, for a period of twenty years,
all war-related research. This
seven-member group recommends that
SRI be sold essentially to itself, thereby
maintaining its non-profit status. SRI
would pay the University, over a period
of twenty to twenty-five years, some
agreed-upon figure, probably in the
neighborhood of $25 million.
One of the seven, student member
Patrick McMahon, stated that he
favored sale of SRI only if it were
determined, after intense study by legal
experts, that the restrictive covenant
was enforceable.
Committee chairman law professor
Kenneth Scott yesterday voiced his
opinion that the covenant, if it were
carefully drawn up, would be
enforceable.
Two members of the committee,
Scott and Provost Richard Lyman,

concur in the recommendation to sell
SRI but emphasize the difficulty in
drawing up a covenant that makes clear
what constitutes objectionable research.
They also lay out specific uses for the
money that Stanford will realize from
the sale of SRI, including the creation of
an Institute for Public Policy Analysis at
Stanford.
