# Sit-In Rejects Resolution To Leave If Senate Acts
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
More than 700 Coalition members
rejected a resolution last night to leave
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) if the Academic Senate were to
take firm action in support of their
demands at tonight's faculty meeting.
The motion was defeated by a less
than two-to-one margin at a mass
meeting in the AEL courtyard.
Earlier in the day about 100
members of Young Americans for
Freedom staged a counterdemonstration
at AEL, after giving Provost Richard W.
Lyman a letter urging the University not
to make any major concessions to the
dissidents (see story below).
Meanwhile, 100 of the protestors

spent most of the afternoon talking to
SRI researchers at the Menlo Park
Institute, while others picketed the
homes of several trustees later in the
day.
Demands for Senate
The motion, proposed by Richard
Drace, asked that the Senate, at
tonight's meeting, recommend:
"1) To end all war-related and
classified research on this campus;
"2) To affirm their (the Senate)
commitment to end CBW
( c h e m i c a 1 -b i o 1 ogical warfare),
cou nterinsurgency, and classified
research at SRI;
"3) To oppose severance of SRI
from Stanford."
The last demand was added as an
amendment by Marc Sapir.
The resolution went on to say, "We
have made a significant beginning here
at AEL toward achieving these goals. We
further recognize that good faith is
demonstrated in actions and not solely
in intimation of good intentions. When
the Senate makes these
recommendations, we agree to vacate
AEL."
Nonviolent Approach
Earlier in the meeting, the group
voted to reaffirm the principles of the
sit-in, namely leaving classified materials

untouched and not destroying any
property in the building.
Later in the evening, Provost Richard
W. Lyman responded to the votes by
noting that Stanford has been fortunate
so far in avoiding the kinds of violence
from which other universities have
suffered.
"From this standpoint, the student
decision not to escalate tactics is
significant," he said. But the sit-in has
imposed "very real costs which must be
borne by the entire community," he
added. "It has halted work for 150 AEL
employees, affecting those who are
doing electrocardiograph research as
much as those whose projects the sit-in
opposes," he noted.
Demonstrated Costs
Continuing payroll costs of more
than $5000 a day can be made up only
from University general funds, he
added. This is equivalent to nearly two
full-year scholarships a day.
"Since students gained entry to the
locked building late Wednesday night,
they have moved into several offices
which also were locked and removed
personal correspondence from locked
desk drawers," he said.
"Interference with the legitimate
rights of others and general disdain for
