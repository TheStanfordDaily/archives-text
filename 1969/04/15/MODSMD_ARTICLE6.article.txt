# Sit-In Rejects Resolution To Leave If Senate Acts
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
More than 700 Coalition members
rejected a resolution last night to leave
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) if the Academic Senate were to
take firm action in support of their
demands at tonight's faculty meeting.
The motion was defeated by a less
than two-to-one margin at a mass
meeting in the AEL courtyard.
Earlier in the day about 100
members of Young Americans for
Freedom staged a counterdemonstration
at AEL, after giving Provost Richard W.
Lyman a letter urging the University not
to make any major concessions to the
dissidents (see story below).
Meanwhile, 100 of the protestors

spent most of the afternoon talking to
SRI researchers at the Menlo Park
Institute, while others picketed the
homes of several trustees later in the
day.
Demands for Senate
The motion, proposed by Richard
Drace, asked that the Senate, at
tonight's meeting, recommend:
"1) To end all war-related and
classified research on this campus;
"2) To affirm their (the Senate)
commitment to end CBW
( c h e m i c a 1 -b i o 1 ogical warfare),
cou nterinsurgency, and classified
research at SRI;
"3) To oppose severance of SRI
from Stanford."
The last demand was added as an
amendment by Marc Sapir.
The resolution went on to say, "We
have made a significant beginning here
at AEL toward achieving these goals. We
further recognize that good faith is
demonstrated in actions and not solely
in intimation of good intentions. When
the Senate makes these
recommendations, we agree to vacate
AEL."
Nonviolent Approach
Earlier in the meeting, the group
voted to reaffirm the principles of the
sit-in, namely leaving classified materials

untouched and not destroying any
property in the building.
Later in the evening, Provost Richard
W. Lyman responded to the votes by
noting that Stanford has been fortunate
so far in avoiding the kinds of violence
from which other universities have
suffered.
"From this standpoint, the student
decision not to escalate tactics is
significant," he said. But the sit-in has
imposed "very real costs which must be
borne by the entire community," he
added. "It has halted work for 150 AEL
employees, affecting those who are
doing electrocardiograph research as
much as those whose projects the sit-in
opposes," he noted.
Demonstrated Costs
Continuing payroll costs of more
than $5000 a day can be made up only
from University general funds, he
added. This is equivalent to nearly two
full-year scholarships a day.
"Since students gained entry to the
locked building late Wednesday night,
they have moved into several offices
which also were locked and removed
personal correspondence from locked
desk drawers," he said.
"Interference with the legitimate
rights of others and general disdain for
the values which keep universities open
and free —no matter how high the moral
imperatives in which these are
cloaked do not consittute the answer
to any real problems which this
community, the nation, and the world
face," Lyman concluded.
Investigators Stalled
Early yesterday morning, three of
the professors who had agreed to take
the names of demonstrators arrived at
AEL. The people inside indicated that
they would not respond until after a 10
a.m. meeting. The professors, Philip
Dawson, James Gibbs, and Donald
Kennedy, decided to wait. Other
investigators arrived around 9:30 a.m.
At the 10 a.m. meeting—by this time
almost all of the 24 investigators had
arrived—the 300 protestors present
reaffirmed their decision to not give
their names.
They added that if the faculty
wanted names, they should read the
complicity statements. As of midnight,
more than 1100 people had signed the
petition. Also, 13 students were fasting
in support of the demands and sit-in.
At SRI, about 200 researchers and
Coalition members met in a parking lot
at noon and talked in small groups for
more than four hours.
Meeting Goes On
When they arrived, Coalition
members found tables and chairs set up
for their use and refreshments being
served. They were met with an apology
that there was no "lawn" available for
the meeting.
This was in reference to a false report
in the San Francisco Examiner Sunday
that the Coalition had planned a
"lawn-in"—a mass rally—outside SRI
yesterday.
The response from SRI employees to
the Coalition demands was varied. Some
said they felt University control of
research there, with students and
faculty having the power to accept or
reject contracts on "moral grounds,"
would be "intolerable.'"
Other staff members advocated that
SRI research be self-controlled, with
employees having the power to make

these decisions. Still others were
sympathetic with the dissidents'
demands.
Watkins' Reception
Late in the afternoon, small groups
left the sit-in and visited the homes of
trustees who live nearby. The most
unique encounter was with trustee Dean
Watkins. When the students arrived,
Watkins answered the door, and the
following conversation took place,
according to the Coalition:
Student: "Mr. Watkins, we'd like to
talk to you."
Watkins: "Are you involved in the
sit-in?"
Student: "Yes, we are."
Watkins: "I'm not going to talk to
you."
Student: "Are you afraid?"
Watkins: "I'm not afraid of
anything."
Student: "Why won't you talk to us
then?"
Watkins: "I'm not going to talk to
you until you clear out of the building
and start acting like adult, civilized
human beings."
Student: "But some 'adult, civilized
human beings' act like . .
(Watkins slams door.)
Student: (to closed door) "Thanks
for the rational dialogue."
Untouched Classified Information
At the mass meeting last night, Steve
Weissman discussed the appropriateness
of not touching the classified
documents, during the debate on
reaffirmation on sit-in policy.
"I would not urge that everyone here
should go and take files," he said. "But
certain information gotten in dubious
ways has been important to the
movement" in the past Weissman added.
He cited information on
now-Presidential advisor Henry
Kissinger's trip to Vietnam in 1966
found by students sitting at Harvard last,
week as an example.
"Therefore, we shouldn't condemn
those who might do this," he said, while
noting that no classified files had been
touched so far. The information might
be needed, Weissman added, because
"the only way we'll get them to change
is to force them to change."

Watkins. When the students arrived,
Watkins answered the door, and the
following conversation took place,
according to the Coalition:
Student: "Mr. Watkins, we'd like to
talk to you."
Watkins: "Are you involved in the
sit-in?"
Student: "Yes, we are."
Watkins: "I'm not going to talk to
you."
Student: "Are you afraid?"
Watkins: "I'm not afraid of
anything."
Student: "Why won't you talk to us
then?"
Watkins: "I'm not going to talk to
you until you clear out of the building
and start acting like adult, civilized
human beings."
Student: "But some 'adult, civilized
human beings' act like . .
(Watkins slams door.)
Student: (to closed door) "Thanks
for the rational dialogue."
Untouched Classified Information
At the mass meeting last night, Steve
Weissman discussed the appropriateness
of not touching the classified
documents, during the debate on
reaffirmation on sit-in policy.
"I would not urge that everyone here
should go and take files," he said. "But
certain information gotten in dubious
ways has been important to the
movement" in the past Weissman added.
He cited information on
now-Presidential advisor Henry
Kissinger's trip to Vietnam in 1966
found by students sitting at Harvard last,
week as an example.
"Therefore, we shouldn't condemn
those who might do this," he said, while
noting that no classified files had been
touched so far. The information might
be needed, Weissman added, because
"the only way we'll get them to change
is to force them to change."
More than 700 Coalition members
rejected a resolution last night to leave
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) if the Academic Senate were to
take firm action in support of their
demands at tonight's faculty meeting.
The motion was defeated by a less
than two-to-one margin at a mass
meeting in the AEL courtyard.
Earlier in the day about 100
members of Young Americans for
Freedom staged a counterdemonstration
at AEL, after giving Provost Richard W.
Lyman a letter urging the University not
to make any major concessions to the
dissidents (see story below).
Meanwhile, 100 of the protestors

spent most of the afternoon talking to
SRI researchers at the Menlo Park
Institute, while others picketed the
homes of several trustees later in the
day.
Demands for Senate
The motion, proposed by Richard
Drace, asked that the Senate, at
tonight's meeting, recommend:
"1) To end all war-related and
classified research on this campus;
"2) To affirm their (the Senate)
commitment to end CBW
( c h e m i c a 1 -b i o 1 ogical warfare),
cou nterinsurgency, and classified
research at SRI;
"3) To oppose severance of SRI
from Stanford."
The last demand was added as an
amendment by Marc Sapir.
The resolution went on to say, "We
have made a significant beginning here
at AEL toward achieving these goals. We
further recognize that good faith is
demonstrated in actions and not solely
in intimation of good intentions. When
the Senate makes these
recommendations, we agree to vacate
AEL."
Nonviolent Approach
Earlier in the meeting, the group
voted to reaffirm the principles of the
sit-in, namely leaving classified materials

untouched and not destroying any
property in the building.
Later in the evening, Provost Richard
W. Lyman responded to the votes by
noting that Stanford has been fortunate
so far in avoiding the kinds of violence
from which other universities have
suffered.
"From this standpoint, the student
decision not to escalate tactics is
significant," he said. But the sit-in has
imposed "very real costs which must be
borne by the entire community," he
added. "It has halted work for 150 AEL
employees, affecting those who are
doing electrocardiograph research as
much as those whose projects the sit-in
opposes," he noted.
Demonstrated Costs
Continuing payroll costs of more
than $5000 a day can be made up only
from University general funds, he
added. This is equivalent to nearly two
full-year scholarships a day.
"Since students gained entry to the
locked building late Wednesday night,
they have moved into several offices
which also were locked and removed
personal correspondence from locked
desk drawers," he said.
"Interference with the legitimate
rights of others and general disdain for
the values which keep universities open
and free —no matter how high the moral
imperatives in which these are
cloaked do not consittute the answer
to any real problems which this
community, the nation, and the world
face," Lyman concluded.
Investigators Stalled
Early yesterday morning, three of
the professors who had agreed to take
the names of demonstrators arrived at
AEL. The people inside indicated that
they would not respond until after a 10
a.m. meeting. The professors, Philip
Dawson, James Gibbs, and Donald
Kennedy, decided to wait. Other
investigators arrived around 9:30 a.m.
At the 10 a.m. meeting—by this time
almost all of the 24 investigators had
arrived—the 300 protestors present
reaffirmed their decision to not give
their names.
They added that if the faculty
wanted names, they should read the
complicity statements. As of midnight,
more than 1100 people had signed the
petition. Also, 13 students were fasting
in support of the demands and sit-in.
At SRI, about 200 researchers and
Coalition members met in a parking lot
at noon and talked in small groups for
more than four hours.
Meeting Goes On
When they arrived, Coalition
members found tables and chairs set up
for their use and refreshments being
served. They were met with an apology
that there was no "lawn" available for
the meeting.
This was in reference to a false report
in the San Francisco Examiner Sunday
that the Coalition had planned a
"lawn-in"—a mass rally—outside SRI
yesterday.
The response from SRI employees to
the Coalition demands was varied. Some
said they felt University control of
research there, with students and
faculty having the power to accept or
reject contracts on "moral grounds,"
would be "intolerable.'"
Other staff members advocated that
SRI research be self-controlled, with
employees having the power to make

these decisions. Still others were
sympathetic with the dissidents'
demands.
Watkins' Reception
Late in the afternoon, small groups
left the sit-in and visited the homes of
trustees who live nearby. The most
unique encounter was with trustee Dean
Watkins. When the students arrived,
Watkins answered the door, and the
following conversation took place,
according to the Coalition:
Student: "Mr. Watkins, we'd like to

Kennedy, decided to wait. Other
investigators arrived around 9:30 a.m.
At the 10 a.m. meeting—by this time
almost all of the 24 investigators had
arrived—the 300 protestors present
reaffirmed their decision to not give
their names.
They added that if the faculty
wanted names, they should read the
complicity statements. As of midnight,
more than 1100 people had signed the
petition. Also, 13 students were fasting
in support of the demands and sit-in.
At SRI, about 200 researchers and
Coalition members met in a parking lot
at noon and talked in small groups for
more than four hours.
Meeting Goes On
When they arrived, Coalition
members found tables and chairs set up
for their use and refreshments being
served. They were met with an apology
that there was no "lawn" available for
the meeting.
This was in reference to a false report
in the San Francisco Examiner Sunday
that the Coalition had planned a
"lawn-in"—a mass rally—outside SRI
yesterday.
The response from SRI employees to
the Coalition demands was varied. Some
said they felt University control of
research there, with students and
faculty having the power to accept or
reject contracts on "moral grounds,"
would be "intolerable.'"
Other staff members advocated that
SRI research be self-controlled, with
employees having the power to make

these decisions. Still others were
sympathetic with the dissidents'
demands.
Watkins' Reception
Late in the afternoon, small groups
left the sit-in and visited the homes of
trustees who live nearby. The most
unique encounter was with trustee Dean
Watkins. When the students arrived,
Watkins answered the door, and the
following conversation took place,
according to the Coalition:
Student: "Mr. Watkins, we'd like to
talk to you."
Watkins: "Are you involved in the
sit-in?"
Student: "Yes, we are."
Watkins: "I'm not going to talk to
you."
Student: "Are you afraid?"
Watkins: "I'm not afraid of
anything."
Student: "Why won't you talk to us
then?"
Watkins: "I'm not going to talk to
you until you clear out of the building
and start acting like adult, civilized
human beings."
Student: "But some 'adult, civilized
human beings' act like . .
(Watkins slams door.)
Student: (to closed door) "Thanks
for the rational dialogue."
Untouched Classified Information
At the mass meeting last night, Steve
Weissman discussed the appropriateness
of not touching the classified
documents, during the debate on
reaffirmation on sit-in policy.
"I would not urge that everyone here
should go and take files," he said. "But
certain information gotten in dubious
ways has been important to the
movement" in the past Weissman added.
He cited information on
now-Presidential advisor Henry
Kissinger's trip to Vietnam in 1966
found by students sitting at Harvard last,
week as an example.
"Therefore, we shouldn't condemn
those who might do this," he said, while
noting that no classified files had been
touched so far. The information might
be needed, Weissman added, because
"the only way we'll get them to change
is to force them to change."
More than 700 Coalition members
rejected a resolution last night to leave
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) if the Academic Senate were to
take firm action in support of their
demands at tonight's faculty meeting.
The motion was defeated by a less
than two-to-one margin at a mass
meeting in the AEL courtyard.
Earlier in the day about 100
members of Young Americans for
Freedom staged a counterdemonstration
at AEL, after giving Provost Richard W.
Lyman a letter urging the University not
to make any major concessions to the
dissidents (see story below).
Meanwhile, 100 of the protestors

spent most of the afternoon talking to
SRI researchers at the Menlo Park
Institute, while others picketed the
homes of several trustees later in the
day.
Demands for Senate
The motion, proposed by Richard
Drace, asked that the Senate, at
tonight's meeting, recommend:
"1) To end all war-related and
classified research on this campus;
"2) To affirm their (the Senate)
commitment to end CBW
( c h e m i c a 1 -b i o 1 ogical warfare),
cou nterinsurgency, and classified
research at SRI;
"3) To oppose severance of SRI
from Stanford."
The last demand was added as an
amendment by Marc Sapir.
The resolution went on to say, "We
have made a significant beginning here
at AEL toward achieving these goals. We
further recognize that good faith is
demonstrated in actions and not solely
in intimation of good intentions. When
the Senate makes these
recommendations, we agree to vacate
AEL."
Nonviolent Approach
Earlier in the meeting, the group
voted to reaffirm the principles of the
sit-in, namely leaving classified materials

untouched and not destroying any
property in the building.
Later in the evening, Provost Richard
W. Lyman responded to the votes by
noting that Stanford has been fortunate
so far in avoiding the kinds of violence
from which other universities have
suffered.
"From this standpoint, the student
decision not to escalate tactics is
significant," he said. But the sit-in has
imposed "very real costs which must be
borne by the entire community," he
added. "It has halted work for 150 AEL
employees, affecting those who are
doing electrocardiograph research as
much as those whose projects the sit-in
opposes," he noted.
Demonstrated Costs
Continuing payroll costs of more
than $5000 a day can be made up only
from University general funds, he
added. This is equivalent to nearly two
full-year scholarships a day.
"Since students gained entry to the
locked building late Wednesday night,
they have moved into several offices
which also were locked and removed
personal correspondence from locked
desk drawers," he said.
"Interference with the legitimate
rights of others and general disdain for
the values which keep universities open
and free —no matter how high the moral
imperatives in which these are
cloaked do not consittute the answer
to any real problems which this
community, the nation, and the world
face," Lyman concluded.
Investigators Stalled
Early yesterday morning, three of
the professors who had agreed to take
the names of demonstrators arrived at
AEL. The people inside indicated that
they would not respond until after a 10
a.m. meeting. The professors, Philip
Dawson, James Gibbs, and Donald
Kennedy, decided to wait. Other
investigators arrived around 9:30 a.m.
