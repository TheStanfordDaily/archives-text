# Do Not 'Give In'
## Occupation Opposed 
### ROGER REED 
Right and moderate students have
urged President Kenneth Pitzer not to
"give in to the demonstrators at AEL."
The latest move in opposition to the
six day-old sit-in came in the form of an
open letter to Pitzer delivered at the
conclusion of a rally yesterday
afternoon in White Memorial Plaza.
Approximately 60 students, organized
by an ad hoc group called Students for
Peaceful Change on Campus, marched
to the President's office on inner quad
to present the letter to Provost Richard
Lyman.
The students were led by Harvey
Hukari, Jr., president of the Stanford
chapter of Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) and included members
of the Young Republicans (YRs), the
Stanford and area high school chapters
of YAF, and students acting
independently of any group.
Administrative Failure
Hukari blasted Pitzer, who was out
of town delivering a speech in
Minneapolis to the Atomic Energy
Commission. "As is typical of university

administrators in time of crisis,
President Pitzer has left town," he
noted.
Carrying signs that read "liberate
AEL, end the sit-in," "Pitzer, faculty:
Don't be bullied," and "freedom now
from Coercive Tactics" and chanting
"Root the Rads Out," the group
marched to the administration offices
on the inner quad.
While they were waiting outside the
offices for Provost Lyman, a student
raised his voice to say that the group
was doing a disservice to the University
by splitting it up over the main issue.
Several students shouted back "What is
the issue? It's violence."

Roman Buhler, a member of the
YRs, spoke up saying "If they are going
to make tactics an issue, then we are
going to make tactics an issue." Hukari
added, "Same as the sit-in last spring, a
group of militants have made demands,
occupied .3 building, and threatened to
stay in that building until their demands
are met."
Hukari said he favored "open
discussions on SRl—not on the terms of
the radicals, but where we can hear the
other side."
When Provost Lyman came out of
the building, Buhler read, the letter
prepared for President Pitzer.
The letter said in part: "We urge you
to delay any action on SRI or related
issues until the views of the majority of
the Stanford Community become
known ... In the meantime, we remind
you that Stanford students have at the
polls twice rejected the sit-in tactic as a
legitimate vehicle for change."
The letter also indicated that "it
appears to many that the University acts
decisively only when threatened by
student pressure tactics. A concession to
the demonstrators at AEL would
seriously encourage this belief . . ."
Moral Stand
Provost Lyman responded by saying
that the sitters-in had raised serious
moral issues. "It is sometimes necessary

to call the civil power . . . But we ha\
an opportunity to bring these matters to
judgment by the on-campus, internal
mechanisms,' 1 lie said.
Harvey Hukari thanked Provost
Lyman and announced that those
interested would proceed to the AEL
"to show them that we are here."
Chanting "out, out," the group
marched to the AEL and marched
around it. There were no incidents.

the building, Buhler read, the letter
prepared for President Pitzer.
The letter said in part: "We urge you
to delay any action on SRI or related
issues until the views of the majority of
the Stanford Community become
known ... In the meantime, we remind
you that Stanford students have at the
polls twice rejected the sit-in tactic as a
legitimate vehicle for change."
The letter also indicated that "it
appears to many that the University acts
decisively only when threatened by
student pressure tactics. A concession to
the demonstrators at AEL would
seriously encourage this belief . . ."
Moral Stand
Provost Lyman responded by saying
that the sitters-in had raised serious
moral issues. "It is sometimes necessary

to call the civil power . . . But we ha\
an opportunity to bring these matters to
judgment by the on-campus, internal
mechanisms,' 1 lie said.
Harvey Hukari thanked Provost
Lyman and announced that those
interested would proceed to the AEL
"to show them that we are here."
Chanting "out, out," the group
marched to the AEL and marched
around it. There were no incidents.
Right and moderate students have
urged President Kenneth Pitzer not to
"give in to the demonstrators at AEL."
The latest move in opposition to the
six day-old sit-in came in the form of an
open letter to Pitzer delivered at the
conclusion of a rally yesterday
afternoon in White Memorial Plaza.
Approximately 60 students, organized
by an ad hoc group called Students for
Peaceful Change on Campus, marched
to the President's office on inner quad
to present the letter to Provost Richard
Lyman.
The students were led by Harvey
Hukari, Jr., president of the Stanford
chapter of Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF) and included members
of the Young Republicans (YRs), the
Stanford and area high school chapters
of YAF, and students acting
independently of any group.
Administrative Failure
Hukari blasted Pitzer, who was out
of town delivering a speech in
Minneapolis to the Atomic Energy
Commission. "As is typical of university

administrators in time of crisis,
President Pitzer has left town," he
noted.
Carrying signs that read "liberate
AEL, end the sit-in," "Pitzer, faculty:
Don't be bullied," and "freedom now
from Coercive Tactics" and chanting
"Root the Rads Out," the group
marched to the administration offices
on the inner quad.
While they were waiting outside the
offices for Provost Lyman, a student
raised his voice to say that the group
was doing a disservice to the University
by splitting it up over the main issue.
Several students shouted back "What is
the issue? It's violence."

Roman Buhler, a member of the
YRs, spoke up saying "If they are going
to make tactics an issue, then we are
going to make tactics an issue." Hukari
added, "Same as the sit-in last spring, a
group of militants have made demands,
occupied .3 building, and threatened to
stay in that building until their demands
are met."
Hukari said he favored "open
discussions on SRl—not on the terms of
the radicals, but where we can hear the
other side."
