# Frosh To Participate In Sponsor Selection
## 
### 
For the first time in three years,
freshmen will be members of the
committee to determine sponsors for
the freshman dorms.
Interested freshmen should pick up
applications for the selection committee
from the Wilbur office and contact Eric
Larson in Rinconada or Caroline Bixby
in Branner. Interviews for committee
members will begin Wednesday.
Applications for next year's sponsors
are due Friday in the Wilbur office.
The new committee proposal was
submitted by Head Sponsor Eric Larson
and approved by the President's
Committee on Undergraduate Housing.
Six sponsors, three freshmen, and three
faculty or staff members will compose
the decision-making body.
Larson, in his approved report, lists

four criteria for sponsor selection. Hr
calls for "intellectual eagerness," a
personable individual, leadership
qualities, and a definite commitment of
time and energy to the task of
sponsoring.
The twelve members of the selection
committee will be chosen, for the most
part, by the head sponsors. Larson will
select the six sponsor members from
volunteers and will ask for faculty/staff
volunteers from people involved with
freshman residences.
The freshman members will be
chosen from applicants by the head
sponsors in consultation with the
applicants' sponsors.
This selection committee will review
sponsor applications, conduct interviews
of the candidates, and make the final
decision regarding next year's sponsors.
