TO MEMBERS OF THE
ACADEMIC COUNCIL
We urge our colleagues to vote disapproval of the Senate action on ROTC.
As provided in the resolution adopted by the Academic Council: Disapproval carries the un
derstanding that the President of the University will enter into negotiations with the Department
of Defense and return to the Senate for its consideration not later than one year from this date
a proposal for continuation of ROTC at Stanford which will assure programs consistent with
the academic objectives and standards of the University, and responsive to the views which have
been expressed by reports, referenda and petitions of the University community.
This means that the faculty will retain fully : is prerogative to control the form that ROTC will
eventually take at Stanford.
As President Pitzer stated in response to questioning at the Academic Council meeting of April 4,
the Senate action on ROTC limits the exploration of alternatives for continuing ROTC at Stanford.
