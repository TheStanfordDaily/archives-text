# Judicial Council To Meet On Electronics Lab Sit-In
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
last night announced it will hold a
hearing at 3:15 today to determine
whether it should take future action in
view of the demonstration which began
at the Applied Ele«.:tronics Laboratory
(AEL) last week (see statement below).
The hearing will be held today in the
Moot Court room of the Stanford
School of Law.
The Council, in a message to faculty
students, staff and others announced
that the hearing will take place "solely
for the purpose of determining whether
the campus policy on disruptions has
been or is being violated" and to decide
whether some action should be taken
prospectively.
The Council pointed out that "the
sole issue at hte hearings will be to
decide whether the normal activities of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory are
interfered with in violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption."

It was pointed out that no charges
will be brought against specific
individuals at today's meeting.
The Council also made note of the
fact that those involved in the
demonstration had failed to name an
individual to represent their interests in
the hearing. It said that an "appropriate
individual" would be named to
represent them.
The Judicial Council includes five
faculty and four students, chosen by
their respective groups. Its chairman,
Prof. Jack Friedenthal of the Law
School, votes only to break ties.
Both President Kenneth S. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman have voiced
their intention of trying to end the
disruption through campus judicial
procedures since the sit-in began.
Students were warned they were in
violation of campus policy on
disruption on two occasions. Monday,
they were asked to identify themselves
by faculty-staff teams representing the
President's office, but only a few would
do so.
Students were read the SJC message
on a pair of occasions yesterday at
meetings in the courtyard of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory. But
with such things as a marriage and the
appearance of Tom Hayden and Bobby
Seale, little attention was paid to the
message.
As Doron Weinberg noted last night
after reading it to the audience, "they
might consider moving the hearing here.
They'd probably have a much larger
audience than they will ever get over
there."
Last night's meeting was
considerably more lively than the
afternoon session.
In that afternoon meeting over 150
people heard a speaker recently arrived
from Harvard state that "a lot of people
in Cambridge send you solidarity." He
spoke of developments in the aftermath
of the bust of over 200 SDS members

by police. The students were protesting
the presence of ROTC on campus.
Elaborating on the interconnections
between government and universities, he
read excerpts from documents that
mentioned such names as McGeorge
Bundy, Henry and Dean
Rusk.
In other afternoon action a vote
setting up a research committee to look
into the research being done in other
buildings was passed. A suggestion was
made to establish a body to screen the
research done in AEL.
The meeting also heard various other
resolutions proposed. One proposed
investigating who has been voting and
how to avoid packing the house at the
general meetings. There have been some
complaints among those sitting in that
many uncommitted people have been
coming to meetings simply for the

opportunity to participate in a
vote to leave the building. It was
noticeable Monday evening after a
vote was taken to remain, that a
large number of those in
attendance got up and left.
During the course of the day,
leafletting took place at the
neighboring industrial park and in
Palo Alto.
The evening meeting was
highlighted by a marriage
ceremony joining Marc Sapir and
Carrie Iverson. The couple was
married in a brief candlelight
ceremony characterized by songs,
chants and interrupted once by
the appearance of a smokebomb.
Following that two films were
shown, one on the Columbia
demonstrations of last spring. But
the surprise of the evening came
with the appearance of Tom
Hayden the founder of the
Students for a Democratic Society
and Bobby Seale chairman of the
Black Panther Party.
Hayden spoke about campus
disturbance saying in part that
"people will see there is going to
be no peace on campus until there
is peace in Vietnam and in the
ghetto."
But he added further that
"when student rebellions become
community rebellions then we're
going to see some action.
Hayden indicates to The Daily
he had only come to bring the
movie on Columbia and that he
was leaving soon after.
Bobby Seale's brief remarks
elicited a more lively response
from those present.
Seale said that "we are tired of
the genocidal warfare they are
waging against all peoples of the
world."
"We're going to tell them we
stand in solidarity with all people.
We are not going to fight racism

with racism. All of us know that
what you fight fire with is water.
The people are the water."
The most enthusiastic response
was elcitied from the audience
when he cried, "We are going to
fight capitalism with socialism."
In other developments The
Daily learned that the solidarity
statement has 1245 signatures.
It was also learned that a bail
fund, which has been steadily
increasing, now totals $8,000.
Contributions include $600 from
the American Federation of
Teachers.
It was disclosed that the
print ing press which has been used
continuously since the outset of
thesit-in has run-off more than
500,000 copies of material.

The meeting also heard various other
resolutions proposed. One proposed

opportunity to participate in a
vote to leave the building. It was
noticeable Monday evening after a
vote was taken to remain, that a
large number of those in
attendance got up and left.
During the course of the day,
leafletting took place at the
neighboring industrial park and in
Palo Alto.
The evening meeting was
highlighted by a marriage
ceremony joining Marc Sapir and
Carrie Iverson. The couple was
married in a brief candlelight
ceremony characterized by songs,
chants and interrupted once by
the appearance of a smokebomb.
Following that two films were
shown, one on the Columbia
demonstrations of last spring. But
the surprise of the evening came
with the appearance of Tom
Hayden the founder of the
Students for a Democratic Society
and Bobby Seale chairman of the
Black Panther Party.
Hayden spoke about campus
disturbance saying in part that
"people will see there is going to
be no peace on campus until there
is peace in Vietnam and in the
ghetto."
But he added further that
"when student rebellions become
community rebellions then we're
going to see some action.
Hayden indicates to The Daily
he had only come to bring the
movie on Columbia and that he
was leaving soon after.
Bobby Seale's brief remarks
elicited a more lively response
from those present.
Seale said that "we are tired of
the genocidal warfare they are
waging against all peoples of the
world."
"We're going to tell them we
stand in solidarity with all people.
We are not going to fight racism

with racism. All of us know that
what you fight fire with is water.
The people are the water."
The most enthusiastic response
was elcitied from the audience
when he cried, "We are going to
fight capitalism with socialism."
In other developments The
Daily learned that the solidarity
statement has 1245 signatures.
It was also learned that a bail
fund, which has been steadily
increasing, now totals $8,000.
Contributions include $600 from
the American Federation of
Teachers.
It was disclosed that the
print ing press which has been used
continuously since the outset of
thesit-in has run-off more than
500,000 copies of material.
The April 3rd Movement
announced that the next general
meeting is scheduled for 1 p.m.
today.
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
last night announced it will hold a
hearing at 3:15 today to determine
whether it should take future action in
view of the demonstration which began
at the Applied Ele«.:tronics Laboratory
(AEL) last week (see statement below).
The hearing will be held today in the
Moot Court room of the Stanford
School of Law.
The Council, in a message to faculty
students, staff and others announced
that the hearing will take place "solely
for the purpose of determining whether
the campus policy on disruptions has
been or is being violated" and to decide
whether some action should be taken
prospectively.
The Council pointed out that "the
sole issue at hte hearings will be to
decide whether the normal activities of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory are
interfered with in violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption."

It was pointed out that no charges
will be brought against specific
individuals at today's meeting.
The Council also made note of the
fact that those involved in the
demonstration had failed to name an
individual to represent their interests in
the hearing. It said that an "appropriate
individual" would be named to
represent them.
The Judicial Council includes five
faculty and four students, chosen by
their respective groups. Its chairman,
Prof. Jack Friedenthal of the Law
School, votes only to break ties.
Both President Kenneth S. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman have voiced
their intention of trying to end the
disruption through campus judicial
procedures since the sit-in began.
Students were warned they were in
violation of campus policy on
disruption on two occasions. Monday,
they were asked to identify themselves
by faculty-staff teams representing the
President's office, but only a few would
do so.
Students were read the SJC message
on a pair of occasions yesterday at
meetings in the courtyard of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory. But
with such things as a marriage and the
appearance of Tom Hayden and Bobby
Seale, little attention was paid to the
message.
As Doron Weinberg noted last night
after reading it to the audience, "they
might consider moving the hearing here.
They'd probably have a much larger
audience than they will ever get over
there."
Last night's meeting was
considerably more lively than the
afternoon session.
In that afternoon meeting over 150
people heard a speaker recently arrived
from Harvard state that "a lot of people
in Cambridge send you solidarity." He
spoke of developments in the aftermath
of the bust of over 200 SDS members

by police. The students were protesting
the presence of ROTC on campus.
Elaborating on the interconnections
between government and universities, he
read excerpts from documents that
mentioned such names as McGeorge
Bundy, Henry and Dean
Rusk.

Contributions include $600 from
the American Federation of
Teachers.
It was disclosed that the
print ing press which has been used
continuously since the outset of
thesit-in has run-off more than
500,000 copies of material.
The April 3rd Movement
announced that the next general
meeting is scheduled for 1 p.m.
today.
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
last night announced it will hold a
hearing at 3:15 today to determine
whether it should take future action in
view of the demonstration which began
at the Applied Ele«.:tronics Laboratory
(AEL) last week (see statement below).
The hearing will be held today in the
Moot Court room of the Stanford
School of Law.
The Council, in a message to faculty
students, staff and others announced
that the hearing will take place "solely
for the purpose of determining whether
the campus policy on disruptions has
been or is being violated" and to decide
whether some action should be taken
prospectively.
The Council pointed out that "the
sole issue at hte hearings will be to
decide whether the normal activities of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory are
interfered with in violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption."

It was pointed out that no charges
will be brought against specific
individuals at today's meeting.
The Council also made note of the
fact that those involved in the
demonstration had failed to name an
individual to represent their interests in
the hearing. It said that an "appropriate
individual" would be named to
represent them.
The Judicial Council includes five
faculty and four students, chosen by
their respective groups. Its chairman,
Prof. Jack Friedenthal of the Law
School, votes only to break ties.
Both President Kenneth S. Pitzer and
Provost Richard Lyman have voiced
their intention of trying to end the
disruption through campus judicial
procedures since the sit-in began.
Students were warned they were in
violation of campus policy on
disruption on two occasions. Monday,
they were asked to identify themselves
by faculty-staff teams representing the
President's office, but only a few would
do so.
Students were read the SJC message
on a pair of occasions yesterday at
meetings in the courtyard of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory. But
with such things as a marriage and the
appearance of Tom Hayden and Bobby
Seale, little attention was paid to the
message.
As Doron Weinberg noted last night
after reading it to the audience, "they
might consider moving the hearing here.
They'd probably have a much larger
audience than they will ever get over
there."
Last night's meeting was
considerably more lively than the
afternoon session.
In that afternoon meeting over 150
people heard a speaker recently arrived
from Harvard state that "a lot of people
in Cambridge send you solidarity." He
spoke of developments in the aftermath
of the bust of over 200 SDS members

by police. The students were protesting
the presence of ROTC on campus.
Elaborating on the interconnections
between government and universities, he
read excerpts from documents that
mentioned such names as McGeorge
Bundy, Henry and Dean
Rusk.
In other afternoon action a vote
setting up a research committee to look
into the research being done in other
buildings was passed. A suggestion was
made to establish a body to screen the
research done in AEL.
The meeting also heard various other
resolutions proposed. One proposed
investigating who has been voting and
how to avoid packing the house at the
general meetings. There have been some
complaints among those sitting in that
many uncommitted people have been
coming to meetings simply for the

opportunity to participate in a
vote to leave the building. It was
noticeable Monday evening after a
vote was taken to remain, that a
large number of those in
attendance got up and left.
During the course of the day,
leafletting took place at the
neighboring industrial park and in
Palo Alto.
The evening meeting was
highlighted by a marriage
ceremony joining Marc Sapir and
Carrie Iverson. The couple was
married in a brief candlelight
ceremony characterized by songs,
chants and interrupted once by
the appearance of a smokebomb.
Following that two films were
shown, one on the Columbia
demonstrations of last spring. But
the surprise of the evening came
with the appearance of Tom
Hayden the founder of the
Students for a Democratic Society
and Bobby Seale chairman of the
Black Panther Party.
Hayden spoke about campus
disturbance saying in part that
"people will see there is going to
be no peace on campus until there
is peace in Vietnam and in the
ghetto."
But he added further that
"when student rebellions become
community rebellions then we're
going to see some action.
Hayden indicates to The Daily
he had only come to bring the
movie on Columbia and that he
was leaving soon after.
Bobby Seale's brief remarks
elicited a more lively response
from those present.
Seale said that "we are tired of
the genocidal warfare they are
waging against all peoples of the
world."
"We're going to tell them we
stand in solidarity with all people.
We are not going to fight racism

with racism. All of us know that
what you fight fire with is water.
The people are the water."
The most enthusiastic response
was elcitied from the audience
when he cried, "We are going to
fight capitalism with socialism."
In other developments The
Daily learned that the solidarity
statement has 1245 signatures.
It was also learned that a bail
fund, which has been steadily
increasing, now totals $8,000.
Contributions include $600 from
the American Federation of
Teachers.
