Denis Hayes's telegram to Ronald
Reagan should suffice as editorial comment
on the governor's advice yesterday to
Stanford administrators about the AEL
sit-in:
"Your administration has severely
crippled the University of California and
nearly destroyed the State College system.
Now who in hell do you think you are to
tell Kenneth Pitzer how to deal with
Stanford?
"The Stanford community does not
consider the witless blundering of Rafferty
and the heavy-handed authoritarianism of

Hayakawa, Kirk, Pusey, Hesburg, etc. to
have illuminated wise pathways of
enlightened college leadership. We have
therefore decided to pursue a different
course-a course of non-violence and
reason.
"The students, faculty, and
administration of Stanford University are
more than capable of handling any
disturbances which occur on our campus.
We would all appreciate your confining
your maladroit blundering to affairs of
state. 4 '
