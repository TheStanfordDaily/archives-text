• Intimidation Childish
Editor, THE DAILY:
I hope by the time this letter
appears, the sit-in at AEL will no
longer be continuing. I have been
quoted in your Friday issue as
calling it "childish." It is, and I
would like to presume on your
good offices to let me devote a
few sentences to explain why.
In my view, we are in danger of
drifting more and more toward a
military garrison state. Military
considerations seem even now to
pervade almost every institution.
Our economy is both sustained
and endangered by "defense"
spending. Our national policy
decisions seem more and more to
be made under the assumption
that our present preoccupation
with defense is right and normal.
Federal support of research is
shaped by military mission and
certainly our universities are not
immune. Last, and of most
pressing urgency, is the war and
the draft. These, it seems to me,
constitute one of the central
problems of this society.
The solution to the problem is
both technical and political. The
technical part—how do we reduce
military expenditures while still
making sure those now working
on defense continue to eat, how
do we support research which will
have greater social utility, by what
means do we evacuate our troops
from Vietnam—these technical
decisions are easy. The political
decision which begins with general
awareness that something is wrong
and ends after hard thought with
the development of a new
d irection—that is the hard
decision. Unfortunately, there is
not yet even a general public
awareness that we have a problem,
much less a clear consensus that
we should look for new
directions.
The students sitting-in are
childish in that like children they
do not evaluate the effectiveness
or the consequences of their
behavior. Their intimidation may

have some minor effect in
speeding up and even influencing
the direction of the trustee's
action on SRI. But in that minor
victory they have made it more
difficult to accomplish the vastly
more important task of generating
general public awareness of what
is wrong. I am angry about their
tactic because now when I try to
convince by fellows on the
government advisory boards of
which I am a member that we
need a fundamental re-evaluation
of our whole military posture it is
that much easier for them to
dismiss the arguments by lumping
me with the "lunatic fringe" of
student activists.
When you are faced with a
problem which must be solved by
persuasion, intimidation is a
childish tactic.

• Seating Problems
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am returning my football
ticket application for the Oregon
State vs. Stanford game and
Washington vs. Stanford game in
the fall of 1969.
The reason for this action
stems from the fact that when my
class of 1937 had its reunion on
the Stanford Campus, with tickets
for the big game in 1967, we were
relegated to end zone seats despite
the fact that there were many
adequate seats available on the
sidelines as close as the 35 to 40
yard lines. When I asked the
reason for this particular
assignment from the President of
the Alumni Association, I was
informed that unless I had been a
regular donor to the Bucks Club,
that this was the seating
assignment I could expect to
obtain in the Stanford Stadium.
Under these circumstances, and
after considerable correspondence

with the President of the Alumni
Association at that time, I have of
course become somewhat
discouraged about attending
football games in which Stanford
is a participant to the extent that
I won't even attend one in my
own locality.

•Ao Radiation Danger
Editor, THE DAILY:
With regard to the article
concerning the sit-in which
appeared in Monday's edition of
the Daily, the implication of the
statement on page 3 concerning
operation of the accelerator in the
High Energy Physics Laboratory
(HEPL) is that anyone in close
proximity to the building would
be exposed to large and possibly
dangerous doses of radiation.
To clarify the matter, I should
like to point out that when the
accelerator is on at its most
powerful level, the additional
amount of radiation in any nearby
building would range from zero to
a 'evel equivalent to normal
cosmic ray intensity. The
radiation level between the
security fence and the HEPL
buidling would be somewhat
higher, but not dangerously so.
The potential high level areas
in HEPL are all within the
confines of the building, totally
enclosed by elaborate protective
devices which makes it impossible
for anyone to enter while the
accelerator is in operation.
The curtailment of operations
in HEPL is purely a precautionary
measure which stems from our
concern that someone might
decide to scale the security fence
adjacent to AEL, thereby possibly
exposing himself to the dangers of
high voltage equipment or to low
but unnecessary doses of
radiation.
