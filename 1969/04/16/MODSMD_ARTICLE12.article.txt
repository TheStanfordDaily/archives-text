## Cramming Coalition Strikes 
### Raymond White 
They came in droves, in small
groups, in one's and in two's.
They came in work clothes and
play clothes, in new clothes and in
old clothes. They came to play
and to work, to do new things,
and to do old things. And they
were not idle. They came from
the whole Peninsula area, from
the City to San Jose.
They were all of one kind, one
purpose, and one action. All
vibrations were beautifully
harmonious as the inner beings of
thousands of people were released
into the expression of their
human souls. For they had come
to talk to their brothers and
sisters, the students, about
learning. Oh, perhaps they came
to do even more than just talk.
They came to demand that the
mind-destroying practice of
cramming be ended forever.
You see, the movement was
really directed against the
institutionalized perversion of
learning known euphemistically as
"finals week cramming." This evil
has gotten into the traditional
fabric of the university structure
to such a degree that it was felt to
be injurious to the learning
processes of the students.
As the invading demonstrators

explained to all the students, in
order for the learning process to
be beneficial it must involve the
efficient absorption of factual
material and then the leisurely
contemplation of the whole
subject under consideration. Only
in this way can an accurate
understanding of the existing
universe be formulated by the
emerging intellect.
The leisurely contemplation of
facts had, it seems, been replaced
at Stanford by long nights of
too-rapid scanning of excessive
amounts of material. This
syndrome was known to increase
through "dead week" and to
reach a fever-pitch during finals
week. So the Coalition met and
decided upon community actions
to be taken during finals week.
Ragged Mobs
The students were taken by
surprise as some 6% of the area
residents (about 60,000 people)
flooded in ragged mobs over the
campus. The action started with
the seizure of the library and the
setting up of a speakers platform
on its second floor.
The purpose of the sit-in was
explained to all students present

and they were asked to go outside
or participate in discussions of
''how to learn." The
demonstrators flooded into the
dorms and where ever they found
students studying they engaged
them in hassle-type debates
extolling the virtues of leisurely
learning and the evils of
cramming.
To all and sundry they
explained that facts must be
allowed to gradually seep into
their proper slots, rather than be
forced into the wrong slots by
hasty thought processes. If the
latter occurred it could cause
illogical mental structures to
encroach upon the mind, and this
would have bad effects on every
one as the students took their
places in society.
Collins, Beatles
Aside from debates, the
entertainment was lavish. Judy
Collins came and sang "Masters of
Cram"; Peter, Paul, and Mary sang
"Cramming in the Wind" and the
Beatles sang "Why Don't You
Cram it in the Road." Many
students joined in singing "I ain't
gon to study no more, no
more . . and so on. Seminars on

how to study by relaxing were
held non-stop for exhausting
periods of time. It was
overwhelming.
Any one who still wanted to
study was just out of luck. The
administration thought the
demonstrators were too numerous
and too determined to be
dispersed peacably, so refused to
take action.
Low Ebb
The individual mayors of the
dissidents' cities declared them
"in transgression of city policy"
to no avail. The students' own
SDS was sitting in somewhere else
and the BSU members joined in
throwing books off the library
shelves. Student power had never
been at such low ebb.
When it as all over and the last
final had been taken, the
demonstrators left, vowing to
return if ever they were needed
again. The students felt somehow
frustrated by the whole affair.
Those who decided to continue in
school had flunked courses to
make up, and all had the feeling
that it was actually learning which
had suffered during the sit in.

explained to all students present

and they were asked to go outside
or participate in discussions of
''how to learn." The
demonstrators flooded into the
dorms and where ever they found
students studying they engaged
them in hassle-type debates
extolling the virtues of leisurely
learning and the evils of
cramming.
To all and sundry they
explained that facts must be
allowed to gradually seep into
their proper slots, rather than be
forced into the wrong slots by
hasty thought processes. If the
latter occurred it could cause
illogical mental structures to
encroach upon the mind, and this
would have bad effects on every
one as the students took their
places in society.
Collins, Beatles
Aside from debates, the
entertainment was lavish. Judy
Collins came and sang "Masters of
Cram"; Peter, Paul, and Mary sang
"Cramming in the Wind" and the
Beatles sang "Why Don't You
Cram it in the Road." Many
students joined in singing "I ain't
gon to study no more, no
more . . and so on. Seminars on

how to study by relaxing were
held non-stop for exhausting
periods of time. It was
overwhelming.
Any one who still wanted to
study was just out of luck. The
administration thought the
demonstrators were too numerous
and too determined to be
dispersed peacably, so refused to
take action.
Low Ebb
The individual mayors of the
dissidents' cities declared them
"in transgression of city policy"
to no avail. The students' own
SDS was sitting in somewhere else
and the BSU members joined in
throwing books off the library
shelves. Student power had never
been at such low ebb.
When it as all over and the last
final had been taken, the
demonstrators left, vowing to
return if ever they were needed
again. The students felt somehow
frustrated by the whole affair.
Those who decided to continue in
school had flunked courses to
make up, and all had the feeling
that it was actually learning which
had suffered during the sit in.
(Raymond White is a graduate
student in Biology —Ed.)
They came in droves, in small
groups, in one's and in two's.
They came in work clothes and
play clothes, in new clothes and in
old clothes. They came to play
and to work, to do new things,
and to do old things. And they
were not idle. They came from
the whole Peninsula area, from
the City to San Jose.
They were all of one kind, one
purpose, and one action. All
vibrations were beautifully
harmonious as the inner beings of
thousands of people were released
into the expression of their
human souls. For they had come
to talk to their brothers and
sisters, the students, about
learning. Oh, perhaps they came
to do even more than just talk.
They came to demand that the
mind-destroying practice of
cramming be ended forever.
You see, the movement was
really directed against the
institutionalized perversion of
learning known euphemistically as
"finals week cramming." This evil
has gotten into the traditional
fabric of the university structure
to such a degree that it was felt to
be injurious to the learning
processes of the students.
As the invading demonstrators

explained to all the students, in
order for the learning process to
be beneficial it must involve the
efficient absorption of factual
material and then the leisurely
contemplation of the whole
subject under consideration. Only
in this way can an accurate
understanding of the existing
universe be formulated by the
emerging intellect.
The leisurely contemplation of
facts had, it seems, been replaced
at Stanford by long nights of
too-rapid scanning of excessive
amounts of material. This
syndrome was known to increase
through "dead week" and to
reach a fever-pitch during finals
week. So the Coalition met and
decided upon community actions
to be taken during finals week.
Ragged Mobs
The students were taken by
surprise as some 6% of the area
residents (about 60,000 people)
flooded in ragged mobs over the
campus. The action started with
the seizure of the library and the
setting up of a speakers platform
on its second floor.
The purpose of the sit-in was
explained to all students present

and they were asked to go outside
or participate in discussions of
