## Classified At AEL 
### Christopher Glazier 
When AEL was formed in the
post war era most of the research
money in electronics was handled
through the department of
defense. It came under the general
heading of Electronic Warfare.
This broad term refers to the
ability to maintain all electronics
during a general battle situation
and to the ability to upset any
enemy electronics. In modern
warfare this can be an extremely
important weapon since so much
military hardware is electronic.
Within the last three years the
question of morality in weapons
research has come up all over
campuses in this country and even
this lab. As early as Nov. 6 S 1967,
official letters concerning what to
do in case of a sit-in in AEL were
distributed to the proper people.
A general clean-up happened
almost overnight. Strict security
precautions like guards,
identification badges and
restricted areas seemed to
disappear. The first floor of the
building began to look like any
university department. Some of
the electronic warfare projects
have disappeared so today only a
small percentage sound like
weaponry.
But the total contract budgets
on some of these contracts remain
the same. The sub-contracts of
questionable nature are replaced
with other sub-contracts that
sound like innocent pure research.

Has the work changed with the
name?
We hope this isn't a cover up
but since it's often classified it's
hard to know. And their are still
some sub-contracts called
electronic warfare or
countermeasures.
This moral question raised can
basically be simplified to the
question of whether classified
research of military interest
should be allowed on a free and
open university dedicated to the
free pursuit and dissemination of
knowledge. Classified research of
this type has comparitively little
educational value but does make
money. The results of this
research can indirectly be
measured in kill ratios and body
counts. Does the university want
this kind of money?
I personally object to being
denied access to some of the
results of this research. I have
refused the draft and cannot
obtain a security clearance which
is required. Yet I have paid tuition
and I ask the same rights as
anyone in the electrical
engineering department. The
existance of these contracts means
my political beliefs limit my
freedom in my department.
