## Sit-In Is Normal 
### Nick Selby 
When President Pitzer
informed the participants of the
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory that they were in
violation of the campus
demonstration policy, he failed to
inform them what constituted the
normal processes of the
university.
Clearly, and thankfully, the
normal processes of AEL have
been obstructed. However, the
actions there must be placed
within a larger context.
The question which must be
raised is if the normal processes of
the university as a whole have
been obstructed. I would argue
that they have not been
obstructed, and have been instead
considerably improved and
enhanced. .Â« '
Is it the normal business of the
university to engage in research
involving radar jamming so that
United States bombers may attack
North Vietnam without fear of
surface-to-air (SAM) missile
retaliation?
Is it the normal business of the
university to engage in
cost-analysis studies of bombing
routes over North Vietnam?
Classified
Is it the normal business of a
university which prides itself on
the free exchange of all ideas to
have $2.2 million of research
classified, so that its results are
available only to the military?
(Six of eight contracts now being
researched at AEL are now
classified.)
Recent translations of
Pentagonese and corrections of
erroneous "clarifications" made
by the Baxter Committee have
shown that work on the radar
jamming and bomb routes has
been conducted at AEL.
People who have read the SRI
booklet have probably noticed
that the last page of that booklet
was a copy of the introductory

page of a Pentagon contract for
research in electronic warfare
applications. The Baxter
committee told the Academic
Senate this contract concerned
only electromagnetics.
At AEL
The liberation press service
issued yesterday further explains
the real research being conducted
at AEL. A careful examination of
research conducted by the sit-in
research committee might easily
lead to the conclusion that almost
none of the research conducted at
AEL within the last few years has
been at all related to the normal
processes of the university.
President Pitzer in his address
to the Trustees last week said that
he personally would like to see an
end to all classified research on
campus.
He thereby tacitly admitted
that the classified research now
conducted at AEL was not in the
category of the normal processes,
and certainly admitted that any
classified research was not in the
best interests of the university.
Sit-In
However, the actions to shut
down AEL have been taken in the
best interests of both the
university and, I might suggest,
the napalmed children of
southeast Asia.
Furthermore, the sit-in has
greatly encouraged discussion of
this research on campus, in
dormatories and in the faculty.
Discussion of the issues and goals
of the SRI coalition fits easily,
within the best interests of the
university.
Because the sit-in has been
conducted in exemplary
non-violent fashion under great
stress, it has conformed to the
normal processes of a university
which has expressed its deep
concern for non-violence in
setting up a Martin Luther King
fund.
Learning
I would further submit that no
one presently engaged in the sit-in
has not learned about
participatory democracy,
leafletting, publishing relevant
literature, and problems in
rearranging America's priorities at
home and abroad.
All of these matters are clearly
within the context of the normal
processes of the university.
It seems, then, given the
participation in the sit-in by many
members of the faculty, and given
the numerous expressions in
dormitories asking for amnesty
for those sitting-in, that any
Student Judicial Council trials are
patently absurd, especially given
the number of participants.
The normal processes of the
university have not been
obstructed in any way. The object
and decidedly abnormal processes
at AEL have been halted, and
hopefully, ended forever.
