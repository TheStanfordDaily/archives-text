# Letters To The Editor
## 'Absence Of Integrity' Charged 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
In reply to questions directed,
during the open meeting of the
Committee on Research Policy,
toward apparent discrepancies
between the actual titles of
classified projects and the
descriptions in the Committee's
report, some Committee members
and project directors responded
that the project titles were
deliberately colored so as to
attract military support, while the
work actually performed was
relatively harmless, and perhaps
even led to social benefits.
May I suggest that these
project directors, and perhaps also
the Committee members, are
guilty of a serious breach of the
Fundamental Standard. Either
they consciously deceived the
project sponsors, which means
they are being paid for goods they
had no intention of delivering, or
else they deceived the Committee
members, or else both they and
the Committee are now deceiving
the public.

I wonder whether any of these
people would tolerate for an
instant evidence of such absence
of integrity on the part of one of
their students. For my part, I do
not see how I can require
honorable behavior from my own
students, when faculty members
are permitted to play the system
both ways for their personal gain.
If the Judicial Council wishes
to justify the support and
confidence of the Stanford
Community, then this is one

situation in which it has the
obligation to act.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Friday the International
Association Policy Board passed a
resolution supporting the sit-in at
AEL. This gives the impression
that all foreign students at
Stanford support the sit-in which
is not entirely correct. According

to the International Center only
about 25% of the foreign students
at Stanford belong to the
association.
We entirely oppose the sit-in.
We do not think that disruption is
an appropriate way for a minority
to seek change, particularly when
the disruption is not directed at
the specific institution (SRI in
this case) where change is wanted.
We noticed Friday night that
the dissenters were not following
their own guidelines since the
doors to lab 207 and 209 were
open, students were milling about

inside, and no responsible AEL
staff members were in sight. The
guidelines clearly stated that there
would be no breaking in. We wish
that the administration would
take firm measures to prevent
further disruptions of this kind.
The International Association
Policy Board's resolution is not
speaking for at least four foreign
students from Norway.

Friday the International
Association Policy Board passed a
resolution supporting the sit-in at
AEL. This gives the impression
that all foreign students at
Stanford support the sit-in which
is not entirely correct. According

to the International Center only
about 25% of the foreign students
at Stanford belong to the
association.
We entirely oppose the sit-in.
We do not think that disruption is
an appropriate way for a minority
to seek change, particularly when
the disruption is not directed at
the specific institution (SRI in
this case) where change is wanted.
We noticed Friday night that
the dissenters were not following
their own guidelines since the
doors to lab 207 and 209 were
open, students were milling about

inside, and no responsible AEL
staff members were in sight. The
guidelines clearly stated that there
would be no breaking in. We wish
that the administration would
take firm measures to prevent
further disruptions of this kind.
The International Association
Policy Board's resolution is not
speaking for at least four foreign
students from Norway.

In reply to questions directed,
during the open meeting of the
Committee on Research Policy,
toward apparent discrepancies
between the actual titles of
classified projects and the
descriptions in the Committee's
report, some Committee members
and project directors responded
that the project titles were
deliberately colored so as to
attract military support, while the
work actually performed was
relatively harmless, and perhaps
even led to social benefits.
May I suggest that these
project directors, and perhaps also
the Committee members, are
guilty of a serious breach of the
Fundamental Standard. Either
they consciously deceived the
project sponsors, which means
they are being paid for goods they
had no intention of delivering, or
else they deceived the Committee
members, or else both they and
the Committee are now deceiving
the public.

I wonder whether any of these
people would tolerate for an
instant evidence of such absence
of integrity on the part of one of
their students. For my part, I do
not see how I can require
honorable behavior from my own
students, when faculty members
are permitted to play the system
both ways for their personal gain.
If the Judicial Council wishes
to justify the support and
confidence of the Stanford
Community, then this is one

situation in which it has the
obligation to act.
