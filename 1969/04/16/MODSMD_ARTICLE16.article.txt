## Choice And Decision In The Sit-in 
### Paul Bernstein 
This article was written
because of a belief that
self-awareness is a desirable
precondition to choice. We can
make better political decisions,
the more we understand what we
have already done.
Even before the Academic
Senate meets (after the writing of
this essay) there are significant
lessons we can and must try to
draw from the experience of the
sit-in .up to today (Tuesday).
Space forces me to limit the
examination here to the Coalition
decision at the Monday evening
meeting, which was to not
promise to vacate AEL even if the
Academic Senate were to endorse
the four demands.
The group at Monday night's
meeting was quite different from
the group that had originally
pressed for the April 3rd demands
and certainly different from the
group which had seized the Lab
last Wednesday night. Five days of
sitting-in had changed many
participants; and five days for
Stanford of having a sit-in had
changed the tenor of the campus
and of those students who come
from the campus each night to the
sit-in's general meetings.
The people who had spent
almost every hour of those five
days at the sit-in had developed a
sense of community and of
identity; but they had also, over
the weekend, been developing a
need for certainty on this
identity. The stronger that need
became, the more difficult it
became for the wide range of
persons in the group to stay
together.

This process of isolation, and
of differentiation, did not become
fully apparent until Monday
night's meeting because persons of
different orientation had
separated themselves off into
different working groups, losing
contact from each other in the
process of dividing up the many
tasks of the movement.
What occurred during that
process of division of labor and
differention of experience was
that different political
orientations about the purpose of
the original movement began to
crystallize.
The people who had worked in
the Coalition because of close
experience with scientific research
and with the constraints put on
that activity by the present
structure of the American
economy wound up spending
most of their time in work on the
detailed issues of the Research
Guidelines Committee and the
Shadow Review Board, and with
following the activities of the
Baxter Committee.
Character and Spirit
Persons who had joined the
Coalition (and in many cases had
inspired antecedents to it) because
of their identification with radical
ideology wound up spending mo6t
of their time in concern and
activity addressed to the character
and spirit of the movement, and
especially of the sit-in itself.
These people composed the
newspaper (the Declassified) and
many other leaflets, discussed
intensively the apprehensions and
frustrations of the participants,

gave the Lab its revolutionary
artistic character, and worked
long hours fulfilling the functions
of the Coordinating Committee.
In many people there was a
mixture of the two orientations;
especially is this true for those
who spent much time in
organizing and communicating to
various sectors of the outside
community.
Strategy and Tactics
In the separate activities of the
movement each orientation can
find its own place, but when the
discussion turns to strategy and
tactics for the coalition as a whole
the two orientations again
discover the existence of one
another. At Monday's meeting the
task facing the coalition was now
to induce the faculty to endorse
the four basic demands and to
pressure the trustees to accept the
same.
Power towards that end had
been gained through the
establishment of the sit-in in the
first place, which had brought the
issue into high priority in the
minds of the faculty and which
had put the Coalition into a
bargaining relationship, vis-a-vis
the faculty and trustees. But in
order to induce a favorable
decision Tuesday night, the
coalition also found itself in need
of knowledge on the values,
motivations, and interests of the
various faculty.
It is at this point that the two
kinds of political orientation
which developed in the sit-in
participants become manifest and
divergent. Not because one group
can be labelled liberal and the

other radical; labelling does not
necessarily explain the content or
significance of an orientation
(though it may be a comfortable
way of avoiding coming to grips
with it).
The reality of politics is that
one can never have complete
knowledge about the persons one
is trying to influence; nor may
one be able at the time of decision
to have sufficient knowledge to
know how the other person shall
respond to one's different actions.
So in place of complete
knowledge we all use paradigms:
simplified images of the persons
we are aiming our action at. We
choose our paradigms on the basis
of our beliefs and previous social
and political experience, yet we
use them as predictions of the
behavior of our present-day
targets.
Thus, the intensive sitters-in
relied on the experience of other
groups at other universities and on
the experience of revolutionary
movements in other parts of the
world. The persons more oriented
toward the research question
alone, tended to rely more on the
statements from faculty members
at the Sunday tea or at recent
meetings, and to rely on their own
personal beliefs about the
bargaining process between parties
which share a minimal degree of
common values.
To ask which paradigm is the
correct one is to forget that both
are oversimplifications of reality.
To ask merely which paradigm is
more correct than the other is to
request factual evidence which in
this case, as in politics, is
unavailable. Nor can we hope to
rely on the outcome of the
Academic Senate meeting to tell
us which paradigm is more
correct.
For if the faculty vote to
support the demands in full,
either that could be because the
sit-in continued without declaring
that it might leave when those
demands were met, or it could be
because enough faculty chose to
look beyond the sit-in to the
issues of research and decided on
the basis of their feelings on that
issue and in spite of their
disapproval of the sit-in.
Dilemma
We cannot know from the vote
itself. Similarly, if the Senate
should fail to endorse the
coalition's demands, either it
could be because they did not
want to respond in a way that
would seem to endorse the sit-in
as a useful and necessary tactic for
campus change (particularly after
it appeared that acceptance of the
demands would not halt it
anyway), or it could be because
not enough of the faculty agree
with the demands themselves and
do not feel yet that the campus is
so disrupted that they feel
compelled to accept the demands
in an overriding interest for
campus order.
That is the dilemma we face as
members of the Stanford
community, and that was the
dilemma felt by any of us who
wished to speak Monday night, in
wanting to guide the total
membership of the crowd to a
correct decision.
