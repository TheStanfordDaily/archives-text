# Won't Endorse Demands
## Engineering Corner Polled 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Twenty-two per cent of the
Engineering students and faculty
polled Monday expressed support
for the goals and demands of the
April 3 Coalition. Sixty-six per
cent of those polled refused to
support the demands.
The results came from a
computer-tabulated poll of both
students and faculty in the School
of Engineering. Eight enterprising
undergraduates set up the poll and
handed out questionnaires
Monday at the Engineering
Corner.
The pollsters received
completed questionnaires from
100 of 560 undergraduates, "250
of 1400 graduate students, and 30
of 150 faculty members.
The poll questioned the
engineers on their views of the
Coalition demands, research
restrictions, and research policy
enforcement mechanisms.
Divergence
Students and faculty often
diverged greatly in their answers
to many questions. For instance,
while almost one-quarter of the
students endorsed the Coalition
demands on campus and Stanford
Research Institute research
policies, only ten per cent of the
faculty polled expressed similar
support. Fully 82 per cent of the
faculty do not endorse the
demands.
A similar split developed over
the question as to whether final
decisions on the demands of those
I sitting-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory should be
made until the demonstrators
have left the premises. The overall
vote was 58 per cent to 34 per
cent in favor of that notion, while
82 per cent of the faculty voted in
favor.
Information Gap
On the subjects of research
restrictions and enforcements, the
polltakers found a great
information gap between
] professors and students, especially
undergraduates. Many poll

subjects expressed concern about
the lack of substantial
information about current policies
and possible reforms.
In addition, many feared the
institution of research guidelines
that would be "sweeping and
literal," according to Peter
Robustelli, a senior in electrical
engineering, and one of the poll's
organizers. The poll seemed to
indicate, he said, that engineers
feel that "rational guidelines
won't come from
confrontations."
As one engineering professor
commented on his questionnaire,
"The objectives, methods, and
results of any research topic are
too diverse to categorize under
such simple labels as peace, war,
etc. For this reason, no large
group of people can intelligently
do other than suggest guidelines
and delegate responsibility to
another smaller group to carry out
policy."
On the subject of research
restrictions, those voting 57 per
cent t6 30 per cent against the
notion that the University should
accept contracts or grants for
research "on any subject for
which support can be obtained."
The voters were split on the
question of acceptibility of
research for which scientific
results are classified. They voted
narrowly in favor of barring
research in fields of
counter-insurgency, research
directly related to the Southeast
Asia war effort, and research
which has only military
applications. Faculty voters alone
were far less favorable to banning
campus research of these forms.
Questions applying to current
guidelines followed by the
University's Research Policies
Committee disclosed that both
professors and students strongly
supported as "adequate" most
current policies.
One current regulation that the
voters found too restrictive was
the rule that "scholarly activities

not accessible for scrutiny by the
entire Advisory Board should not
be considered in connection with
appointments, reappointments or
promotions." Thirty-two per cent
of all voters and 41 per cent of
the faculty members who voted
found t lie regulation overly
restrictive.
Engineers also found too
restrictive, by 49 per cent to 44
per cent, the regulation that "the
University should enter no
contract and accept no grant that
involves the collection of social or
behavioral data in a foreign
country and requires the security
clearance of any person involved
in the project."
On the subject of enforcement
mechanisms for research policies,
the engineers find acceptable
review of research by either the
school, department, or a
committee composed of
representatives of different
groups.
For such a committee, the
engineers rejected overwhelmingly
specific, special representation for
such groups as blacks,
Mexican-Americans, Third World
members, high school students,

concerned peninsula residents and
workers, and students from the
Third World. "Engineers don't see
why these groups should have
special representation,"
commented one student. Only a
trickle of voters favored such
representation.
The voters were split on
whether trustees should sit on
research review boards, with
faculty far more favorable.
However, they found that
administrators, faculty from
departments actually engaged in
types of research subjects to
review by the committee, and that
Stanford students should be
represented on the revie"
committee.
The engineers found little
attraction in an April 3 Coalition
proposal of a "shadow r-'view
board" which would evaluate the
desirability of research according
to the guidelines accepted by the
Coalition. Only 10.7 per cent of
those voting endorsed the idea,
while 72 per cent rejected it,
including 89 per cent of the
faculty. They expressed much
greater reliance in the Academic
Senate as an appeal body.

groups.
For such a committee, the
engineers rejected overwhelmingly
specific, special representation for
such groups as blacks,
Mexican-Americans, Third World
members, high school students,

concerned peninsula residents and
workers, and students from the
Third World. "Engineers don't see
why these groups should have
special representation,"
commented one student. Only a
trickle of voters favored such
representation.
The voters were split on
whether trustees should sit on
research review boards, with
faculty far more favorable.
However, they found that
administrators, faculty from
departments actually engaged in
types of research subjects to
review by the committee, and that
Stanford students should be
represented on the revie"
committee.
The engineers found little
attraction in an April 3 Coalition
proposal of a "shadow r-'view
board" which would evaluate the
desirability of research according
to the guidelines accepted by the
Coalition. Only 10.7 per cent of
those voting endorsed the idea,
while 72 per cent rejected it,
including 89 per cent of the
faculty. They expressed much
greater reliance in the Academic
Senate as an appeal body.

Twenty-two per cent of the
Engineering students and faculty
polled Monday expressed support
for the goals and demands of the
April 3 Coalition. Sixty-six per
cent of those polled refused to
support the demands.
The results came from a
computer-tabulated poll of both
students and faculty in the School
of Engineering. Eight enterprising
undergraduates set up the poll and
handed out questionnaires
Monday at the Engineering
Corner.
The pollsters received
completed questionnaires from
100 of 560 undergraduates, "250
of 1400 graduate students, and 30
of 150 faculty members.
The poll questioned the
engineers on their views of the
Coalition demands, research
restrictions, and research policy
enforcement mechanisms.
Divergence
Students and faculty often
diverged greatly in their answers
to many questions. For instance,
while almost one-quarter of the
students endorsed the Coalition
demands on campus and Stanford
Research Institute research
policies, only ten per cent of the
faculty polled expressed similar
support. Fully 82 per cent of the
faculty do not endorse the
demands.
A similar split developed over
the question as to whether final
decisions on the demands of those
I sitting-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory should be
made until the demonstrators
have left the premises. The overall
vote was 58 per cent to 34 per
cent in favor of that notion, while
82 per cent of the faculty voted in
favor.
Information Gap
On the subjects of research
restrictions and enforcements, the
polltakers found a great
information gap between
] professors and students, especially
undergraduates. Many poll

subjects expressed concern about
the lack of substantial
information about current policies
and possible reforms.
In addition, many feared the
institution of research guidelines
that would be "sweeping and
literal," according to Peter
Robustelli, a senior in electrical
engineering, and one of the poll's
organizers. The poll seemed to
indicate, he said, that engineers
feel that "rational guidelines
won't come from
confrontations."
As one engineering professor
commented on his questionnaire,
"The objectives, methods, and
results of any research topic are
too diverse to categorize under
such simple labels as peace, war,
etc. For this reason, no large
group of people can intelligently
do other than suggest guidelines
and delegate responsibility to
another smaller group to carry out
policy."
On the subject of research
restrictions, those voting 57 per
cent t6 30 per cent against the
notion that the University should
accept contracts or grants for
research "on any subject for
which support can be obtained."
The voters were split on the
question of acceptibility of
research for which scientific
results are classified. They voted
narrowly in favor of barring
research in fields of
counter-insurgency, research
directly related to the Southeast
Asia war effort, and research
which has only military
applications. Faculty voters alone
were far less favorable to banning
campus research of these forms.
Questions applying to current
guidelines followed by the
University's Research Policies
Committee disclosed that both
professors and students strongly
supported as "adequate" most
current policies.
One current regulation that the
voters found too restrictive was
the rule that "scholarly activities

not accessible for scrutiny by the
entire Advisory Board should not
be considered in connection with
appointments, reappointments or
promotions." Thirty-two per cent
of all voters and 41 per cent of
the faculty members who voted
found t lie regulation overly
restrictive.
Engineers also found too
restrictive, by 49 per cent to 44
per cent, the regulation that "the
University should enter no
contract and accept no grant that
involves the collection of social or
behavioral data in a foreign
country and requires the security
clearance of any person involved
in the project."
On the subject of enforcement
mechanisms for research policies,
the engineers find acceptable
review of research by either the
school, department, or a
committee composed of
representatives of different
groups.

research "on any subject for
which support can be obtained."
The voters were split on the
question of acceptibility of
research for which scientific
results are classified. They voted
narrowly in favor of barring
research in fields of
counter-insurgency, research
directly related to the Southeast
Asia war effort, and research
which has only military
applications. Faculty voters alone
were far less favorable to banning
campus research of these forms.
Questions applying to current
guidelines followed by the
University's Research Policies
Committee disclosed that both
professors and students strongly
supported as "adequate" most
current policies.
One current regulation that the
voters found too restrictive was
the rule that "scholarly activities

not accessible for scrutiny by the
entire Advisory Board should not
be considered in connection with
appointments, reappointments or
promotions." Thirty-two per cent
of all voters and 41 per cent of
the faculty members who voted
found t lie regulation overly
restrictive.
Engineers also found too
restrictive, by 49 per cent to 44
per cent, the regulation that "the
University should enter no
contract and accept no grant that
involves the collection of social or
behavioral data in a foreign
country and requires the security
clearance of any person involved
in the project."
On the subject of enforcement
mechanisms for research policies,
the engineers find acceptable
review of research by either the
school, department, or a
committee composed of
representatives of different
groups.
For such a committee, the
engineers rejected overwhelmingly
specific, special representation for
such groups as blacks,
Mexican-Americans, Third World
members, high school students,

concerned peninsula residents and
workers, and students from the
Third World. "Engineers don't see
why these groups should have
special representation,"
commented one student. Only a
trickle of voters favored such
representation.
The voters were split on
whether trustees should sit on
research review boards, with
faculty far more favorable.
However, they found that
administrators, faculty from
departments actually engaged in
types of research subjects to
review by the committee, and that
Stanford students should be
represented on the revie"
committee.
The engineers found little
attraction in an April 3 Coalition
proposal of a "shadow r-'view
board" which would evaluate the
desirability of research according
to the guidelines accepted by the
Coalition. Only 10.7 per cent of
those voting endorsed the idea,
while 72 per cent rejected it,
including 89 per cent of the
faculty. They expressed much
greater reliance in the Academic
Senate as an appeal body.

Twenty-two per cent of the
Engineering students and faculty
polled Monday expressed support
for the goals and demands of the
April 3 Coalition. Sixty-six per
cent of those polled refused to
support the demands.
The results came from a
computer-tabulated poll of both
students and faculty in the School
of Engineering. Eight enterprising
undergraduates set up the poll and
handed out questionnaires
Monday at the Engineering
Corner.
The pollsters received
completed questionnaires from
100 of 560 undergraduates, "250
of 1400 graduate students, and 30
of 150 faculty members.
The poll questioned the
engineers on their views of the
Coalition demands, research
restrictions, and research policy
enforcement mechanisms.
Divergence
Students and faculty often
diverged greatly in their answers
to many questions. For instance,
while almost one-quarter of the
students endorsed the Coalition
demands on campus and Stanford
Research Institute research
policies, only ten per cent of the
faculty polled expressed similar
support. Fully 82 per cent of the
faculty do not endorse the
demands.
A similar split developed over
the question as to whether final
decisions on the demands of those
I sitting-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory should be
made until the demonstrators
have left the premises. The overall
vote was 58 per cent to 34 per
cent in favor of that notion, while
82 per cent of the faculty voted in
favor.
Information Gap
On the subjects of research
restrictions and enforcements, the
polltakers found a great
information gap between
] professors and students, especially
undergraduates. Many poll

subjects expressed concern about
the lack of substantial
information about current policies
and possible reforms.
In addition, many feared the
institution of research guidelines
that would be "sweeping and
literal," according to Peter
Robustelli, a senior in electrical
engineering, and one of the poll's
organizers. The poll seemed to
indicate, he said, that engineers
feel that "rational guidelines
won't come from
confrontations."
As one engineering professor
commented on his questionnaire,
"The objectives, methods, and
results of any research topic are
too diverse to categorize under
such simple labels as peace, war,
etc. For this reason, no large
group of people can intelligently
do other than suggest guidelines
and delegate responsibility to
another smaller group to carry out
policy."
On the subject of research
restrictions, those voting 57 per
cent t6 30 per cent against the
notion that the University should
accept contracts or grants for
research "on any subject for
which support can be obtained."
