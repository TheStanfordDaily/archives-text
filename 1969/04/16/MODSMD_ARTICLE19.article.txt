# Lacrossers Add To Win Streak, 7-4, 11-2
## 
### 
Although playing up-and-down
lacrosse, the Stanford lacrosse
team extended its victory skein to
twenty-five games by downing
league foes the San Francisco
Lacrosse Club and the Marin
County Lacrosse Club on
Saturday and Sunday.
The Indians had a relatively
tough day of it against a tough
and spirited San Francisco
contingent for a 7-4 victory. All
the San Francisco goals came in
extra-man situations and the
Indians were never behind.
The Sunday affair was a bit
easier, as the Indians powered
themselves to a decisive, if not
particularly polished 11-2 win.
Chip Loveman turned a hat
trick for Stanford against San
Francisco, scoring the first three
Stanford goals. The San Francisco
team double-teamed attack star
George Muser, leaving the clever
Loveman alone waving his stick
on the crease. Loveman took
feeds from Muser, Ben Smith, and
Ted Suen for all of the Stanford
first quarter goals. Meanwhile, the
Stanford man-down defense had a
little trouble getting organized
and gave San Francisco a goal on a
feed across the cage from
Fippinger to Strassburger.
Both teams scored once in the
second quarter. With nine minutes
gone, Stanford's John Howe
quick-sticked a feed from Suen
for a tally. Then, with only fifteen
seconds in the half San
Francisco's Hindes teamed up

with Markell for a goal, while
Stanford Defenseman Wade
Killefer sat out a penalty.
Markell, a veteran of Princeton
and the Mount Washington
Lacrosse Club, was kept
completely at bay by Killefer all
afternoon. Killefer, however, drew
two more penalties, which
accounted for the two other San
Francisco goals.
The Tribe completely
controlled the second half, though
they had some difficulty getting
on the scoreboard. Bill Callison
scored late in the third period on
a drive from the midfield, while
Muser added two fourth period
tallies.
In the Marin game, which was
marred by eighteen penalties, the
Indians were led by a hat trick
from Dirk Speas and fine goalie
play from Jay Morse and Dan
Clement. Loveman once again got
the first Stanford goal, shooting
out of a forest of Marin sticks.
Speas followed with three
straight, with help from Stu
Childs and Ben Smith. Other
scorers for Stanford were Larry
Beard with two goals, Ted Suen
with a goal and an assist, Smith
with a goal in addition to his
assist, a goal and two assists for
Muser, and a solo tally from Bill
Callison.
Marin scored once in the first
period and once in the fourth on
unassisted strikes by Bob Heaton
and Jim Hart.

out of a forest of Marin sticks.
Speas followed with three
straight, with help from Stu
Childs and Ben Smith. Other
scorers for Stanford were Larry
Beard with two goals, Ted Suen
with a goal and an assist, Smith
with a goal in addition to his
assist, a goal and two assists for
Muser, and a solo tally from Bill
Callison.
Marin scored once in the first
period and once in the fourth on
unassisted strikes by Bob Heaton
and Jim Hart.
Although playing up-and-down
lacrosse, the Stanford lacrosse
team extended its victory skein to
twenty-five games by downing
league foes the San Francisco
Lacrosse Club and the Marin
County Lacrosse Club on
Saturday and Sunday.
The Indians had a relatively
tough day of it against a tough
and spirited San Francisco
contingent for a 7-4 victory. All
the San Francisco goals came in
extra-man situations and the
Indians were never behind.
The Sunday affair was a bit
easier, as the Indians powered
themselves to a decisive, if not
particularly polished 11-2 win.
Chip Loveman turned a hat
trick for Stanford against San
Francisco, scoring the first three
Stanford goals. The San Francisco
team double-teamed attack star
George Muser, leaving the clever
Loveman alone waving his stick
on the crease. Loveman took
feeds from Muser, Ben Smith, and
Ted Suen for all of the Stanford
first quarter goals. Meanwhile, the
Stanford man-down defense had a
little trouble getting organized
and gave San Francisco a goal on a
feed across the cage from
Fippinger to Strassburger.
Both teams scored once in the
second quarter. With nine minutes
gone, Stanford's John Howe
quick-sticked a feed from Suen
for a tally. Then, with only fifteen
seconds in the half San
Francisco's Hindes teamed up

with Markell for a goal, while
Stanford Defenseman Wade
Killefer sat out a penalty.
Markell, a veteran of Princeton
and the Mount Washington
Lacrosse Club, was kept
completely at bay by Killefer all
afternoon. Killefer, however, drew
two more penalties, which
accounted for the two other San
Francisco goals.
The Tribe completely
controlled the second half, though
they had some difficulty getting
on the scoreboard. Bill Callison
scored late in the third period on
a drive from the midfield, while
Muser added two fourth period
tallies.
In the Marin game, which was
marred by eighteen penalties, the
Indians were led by a hat trick
from Dirk Speas and fine goalie
play from Jay Morse and Dan
Clement. Loveman once again got
the first Stanford goal, shooting
out of a forest of Marin sticks.
Speas followed with three
