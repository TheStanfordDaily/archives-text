# Rambo Member Of War Group
## 
### 
Stanford professors frequently base
their esteem of colleagues on
membership in exclusive and unique
organizations. By this criterion,
Professor William R. Rambo, the
director of Stanford's Applied
Electronics Laboratory, must rank high.
Demonstrators at AEL discovered on
Professor Rambo's desk yesterday an
unusual membership card and
certificate. The document stated that
Rambo, "having evinced a sincere
interest and dedication to the
advancement of the art of electronic
warfare," was elected as a member of
the Association of Old Crows.
When contacted, Rambo confirmed
his charter membership but said that he
had never attended any meetings.
The membership card lists as the
aims and purposes of the Old Crows:
To foster and preserve the art of
electronic warfare
To promote the exchange of ideas
and information in this field
To recognize advances and
contributions to Electronic Warfare
To document this history of
Electronic Warfare
To commemorate fully the memory
of Fellow Crows
Their Latin motto means "They will
not see." "Old Crows" refers to the
black bombers that flew at night in
World War 11. Rambo flew as a radar
operator. They publish a magazine.
