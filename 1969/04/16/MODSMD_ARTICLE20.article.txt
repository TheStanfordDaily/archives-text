# Pitzer Raps Atomic Tests
## 
### 
Stanford University President
Kenneth Pitzer called yesterday
for public hearings before
underground nuclear tests are held
at new sites in central Nevada and
the Aleutian Islands.
Both locations have a history
of earthquakes.
Pitzer, a former director of the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), urged that "some higher
authority" than the AEC assess
possible hazards of new testing.
Until last January, Pitzer was a
member of the President's
scientific advisory committee. The
American Chemical Society (ACS)
awarded him the 1969 Priestly
gold medal for "distinguished
services to chemistry."
Pitzer, speaking at a meeting of
the ACS, said that new off-site
testing should be probed by
scientists who have no AEC
affiliation since tests involve
judgment as well as expertise "and
might therefore involve a conflict
of interest."
"When I was asked to look into
this situation a few months ago,"
Pitzer commented, "I was struck
by the fact that there is no real
need for secrecy in discussing this
problem."
"The details of the explosive
devices were irrelevant. All of the
essential information was
unclassified, or ought to be.
"Hence I urged, as did others,
that the problem be discussed
openly. It has now received some
attention at a recent
A EC-sponsored conference on
off-site safety programs for
underground nuclear detonations,
held at Las Vegas. The initial
report, while desirable in opening
the subject for public discussion,
is inadequate."
Following a major public
hearing, "Congressmen, governors
and other responsible officials as
well as the interested public can
form their own judgment,
balancing this and any other risks
against the need for tests or the
extra costs of moving to a
non-seismic location.
"The problem in this case is
not that the risk is completely
ignored; rather it has been

examined primarily in closed
circles with the effective judgment
rendered by officials committed
to the test program.
"To be sure, the president
makes the final decision on
nuclear tests, but by that time all
the preparations have been made
and there is enormous pressure on
him to go ahead. This sort of
problem should be considered at
an earlier date by an impartial
judge and jury."
ACS a Promoter
The trouble, as Pitzer saw it, is
that the ACS is now the promoter
as well as the regulator of new
nuclear technology.
"Unless some higher authority
keeps emphasizing questions of
risks and damage, the promotional
side of the agency is likely to
dominate."
In the case of the SST, the
convenience of faster travel for a
few people should have been
"strictly secondary" to the
majority of people who do not
want to be annoyed by sonic
booms, he said.
"This should have been
recognized before a major project
was undertaken with thousands of
people employed. Now there are
political and economic pressures
to continue the project, and there
will be human hardships if it is
terminated."
In the future, he said, "growth
in support of science cannot be
expected to be much greater than
the growth in our total national
productivity."
He said there is "a blatant
contradiction" between federal
programs encouraging the
development of additional major
centers of academic science and
the absence of additional funds to
finance these centers on a
continuing basis.
If the limited support avilable
to support science programs in

colleges is spread too thinly, "we
will destroy the excellence of our
present centers of real distinction
and great productivity," he said.

Kenneth Pitzer called yesterday
for public hearings before
underground nuclear tests are held
at new sites in central Nevada and
the Aleutian Islands.
Both locations have a history
of earthquakes.
Pitzer, a former director of the
Atomic Energy Commission
(AEC), urged that "some higher
authority" than the AEC assess
possible hazards of new testing.
Until last January, Pitzer was a
member of the President's
scientific advisory committee. The
American Chemical Society (ACS)
awarded him the 1969 Priestly
gold medal for "distinguished
services to chemistry."
Pitzer, speaking at a meeting of
the ACS, said that new off-site
testing should be probed by
scientists who have no AEC
affiliation since tests involve
judgment as well as expertise "and
might therefore involve a conflict
of interest."
"When I was asked to look into
this situation a few months ago,"
Pitzer commented, "I was struck
by the fact that there is no real
need for secrecy in discussing this
problem."
"The details of the explosive
devices were irrelevant. All of the
essential information was
unclassified, or ought to be.
"Hence I urged, as did others,
that the problem be discussed
openly. It has now received some
attention at a recent
A EC-sponsored conference on
off-site safety programs for
underground nuclear detonations,
held at Las Vegas. The initial
report, while desirable in opening
the subject for public discussion,
is inadequate."
Following a major public
hearing, "Congressmen, governors
and other responsible officials as
well as the interested public can
form their own judgment,
balancing this and any other risks
against the need for tests or the
extra costs of moving to a
non-seismic location.
"The problem in this case is
not that the risk is completely
ignored; rather it has been

examined primarily in closed
circles with the effective judgment
rendered by officials committed
to the test program.
"To be sure, the president
makes the final decision on
nuclear tests, but by that time all
the preparations have been made
and there is enormous pressure on
him to go ahead. This sort of
problem should be considered at
an earlier date by an impartial
judge and jury."
ACS a Promoter
The trouble, as Pitzer saw it, is
that the ACS is now the promoter
as well as the regulator of new
nuclear technology.
"Unless some higher authority
keeps emphasizing questions of
risks and damage, the promotional
side of the agency is likely to
dominate."
In the case of the SST, the
convenience of faster travel for a
few people should have been
"strictly secondary" to the
majority of people who do not
want to be annoyed by sonic
booms, he said.
"This should have been
recognized before a major project
was undertaken with thousands of
people employed. Now there are
political and economic pressures
to continue the project, and there
will be human hardships if it is
terminated."
In the future, he said, "growth
in support of science cannot be
expected to be much greater than
the growth in our total national
productivity."
He said there is "a blatant
contradiction" between federal
programs encouraging the
development of additional major
centers of academic science and
the absence of additional funds to
finance these centers on a
continuing basis.
If the limited support avilable
to support science programs in

colleges is spread too thinly, "we
will destroy the excellence of our
present centers of real distinction
and great productivity," he said.
