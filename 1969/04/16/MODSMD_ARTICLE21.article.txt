### JOHN ARTHUR 
Proving that Southern
California smog may indeed have
its salutary effects, Stanford's
Indians trekked south last
weekend and won two out of
three baseball games. And, in an
impressive weekend, they nearly
won the third.
Taking on two of the best
teams in the nation, the Tribe
ended up in a trio of tight games,
all dominated by fine
pitching—which just happens to
be Stanford's main weapon. On
Friday, Bob Boone hurled a seven
hitter and Jack Hodges homered
as the Indians edged UCLA, 3-2.
On Saturday USC's Trojans took
the opener of a double-header
from Stanford by a big 1-0
margin, then were beaten in the
nightcap, 4-3, mainly because of a
sensational relief stint by
sophomore Jim Coate.
Last night Stanford played a
non-league game against the
number one ranked Santa Clara
Broncos in San Jose.
Stanford had to come from
behind to win the UCLA game.
The Bruins scored on three singles
in the first, then added their
second run on a leadoff homer by
Steve Shedd in the third. The
Tribe, meanwhile, was getting
men on base easily enough (three
in the first, then one or more for
the next four innings), but
couldn't get 'em across. Bruin
catcher Bill Leßlanc wasn't overly
cooperative, of course —he threw
out four Stanford runners during
the first six innings.

But Hodges' homer, following
a walk to Mark Marquess, put the
Tribe on the board in the sixth,
and set the stage for the ninth.
Jack Lynn, sent in to hit for Mike
Ewing by Coach Young, led off
the frame with a single, making
his boss look brilliant in the
process. Shortstop Russ Tweet
then sacrificed Lynn to second,
and, an out and a walk later, third
baseman Chuck Williams punched
a two-out single to score Lynn
and give the Tribe the 3-2 lead.
The victory was insured when
Boone retired the side in the
bottom half of the inning, getting
Shedd, his last man, to take a
third strike. In all, Boone walked
five and struck out 12—a pretty
fair performance for a rookie
moundsman in his Pac-8 debut.
Boone returned to his old
haunt—third base (he was
all-league there last year)—as the
Indians took on USC in
Saturday's double-header. The
Tribe fell behind in the first
inning, and they could have
stopped it right there. Stanford's
starter Phil Keller walked the
leadoff hitter, then saw him score
two outs later on a triple by first
baseman Bill Seinsoth (who led
the league last year with a .429
average), and that was it, baby.
Aside from a single by Boone
in the third and a couple more by

Hodges and Williams in the
seventh (and last) inning, all the
Tribe could manage were a few
loud fouls. Keller fanned ten, gave
up four hits and walked two while
taking the loss—a tough one.
Showing that Stanford
students can learn even quicker
than you think, the Tribe came
right back to open the second
game with a run from the leadoff
hitter. Marquess opened the game
with a triple, then scored on a
wild pitch, and presto . . . Stan
ford 1, USC zip. But, unlike the
first game, this one wasn't over.
Rod Poteete, the lanky ace of
the Tribe staff, suffered the
revolting development of being
tagged for three home runs in the
fourth, which put the Card heroes
behind, 3-1. But one run was
chipped from that deficit when

the Indians scored in the fifth on
a double by catcher Bob Edie and
three walks. Then, in the sixth,
Williams scored on a passed ball
after reaching base on a single,
and Poteete singled in second
baseman Dick Borchers for what
proved to be the winning run.
Poteete ran into some trouble
in the bottom half of the sixth,
but was bailed out of what could
have been a disastrous hole by
Hodges (left-field)-Boone-Edie
double play which ended the
inning. When a hit batsman and a
walk threatened to turn the
seventh into a disaster too, Young
went to his bull pen for southpaw
sophomore Jim Coate.
Coate dumped so much water
on SC's potential fire that the
Coast Guard was nearly called in.
Situation: bases loaded, no outs.

Enter Young. Exit Poteete. Enter
Coate. Enter Trojan pinch-hitter.
Exit Trojan pinch-hitter (looks at
a third strike). Enter Trojan
catcher named Perkins. He has a
homer and single in three trips.

side in the eighth and ninth
frames, striking out the last two
hitters, to wrap up a piece of
sensational relief and, not
incidentally, the game.

third strike. In all, Boone walked
five and struck out 12—a pretty
fair performance for a rookie
moundsman in his Pac-8 debut.
Boone returned to his old
haunt—third base (he was
all-league there last year)—as the
Indians took on USC in
Saturday's double-header. The
Tribe fell behind in the first
inning, and they could have
stopped it right there. Stanford's
starter Phil Keller walked the
leadoff hitter, then saw him score
two outs later on a triple by first
baseman Bill Seinsoth (who led
the league last year with a .429
average), and that was it, baby.
Aside from a single by Boone
in the third and a couple more by

Hodges and Williams in the
seventh (and last) inning, all the
Tribe could manage were a few
loud fouls. Keller fanned ten, gave
up four hits and walked two while
taking the loss—a tough one.
Showing that Stanford
students can learn even quicker
than you think, the Tribe came
right back to open the second
game with a run from the leadoff
hitter. Marquess opened the game
with a triple, then scored on a
wild pitch, and presto . . . Stan
ford 1, USC zip. But, unlike the
first game, this one wasn't over.
Rod Poteete, the lanky ace of
the Tribe staff, suffered the
revolting development of being
tagged for three home runs in the
fourth, which put the Card heroes
behind, 3-1. But one run was
chipped from that deficit when

the Indians scored in the fifth on
a double by catcher Bob Edie and
three walks. Then, in the sixth,
Williams scored on a passed ball
after reaching base on a single,
and Poteete singled in second
baseman Dick Borchers for what
proved to be the winning run.
Poteete ran into some trouble
in the bottom half of the sixth,
but was bailed out of what could
have been a disastrous hole by
Hodges (left-field)-Boone-Edie
double play which ended the
inning. When a hit batsman and a
walk threatened to turn the
seventh into a disaster too, Young
went to his bull pen for southpaw
sophomore Jim Coate.
Coate dumped so much water
on SC's potential fire that the
Coast Guard was nearly called in.
Situation: bases loaded, no outs.

Enter Young. Exit Poteete. Enter
Coate. Enter Trojan pinch-hitter.
Exit Trojan pinch-hitter (looks at

frames, striking out the last two
hitters, to wrap up a piece of
sensational relief and, not
incidentally, the game.
Proving that Southern
California smog may indeed have
its salutary effects, Stanford's
Indians trekked south last
weekend and won two out of
three baseball games. And, in an
impressive weekend, they nearly
won the third.
Taking on two of the best
teams in the nation, the Tribe
ended up in a trio of tight games,
all dominated by fine
pitching—which just happens to
be Stanford's main weapon. On
Friday, Bob Boone hurled a seven
hitter and Jack Hodges homered
as the Indians edged UCLA, 3-2.
On Saturday USC's Trojans took
the opener of a double-header
from Stanford by a big 1-0
margin, then were beaten in the
nightcap, 4-3, mainly because of a
sensational relief stint by
sophomore Jim Coate.
Last night Stanford played a
non-league game against the
number one ranked Santa Clara
Broncos in San Jose.
Stanford had to come from
behind to win the UCLA game.
The Bruins scored on three singles
in the first, then added their
second run on a leadoff homer by
Steve Shedd in the third. The
Tribe, meanwhile, was getting
men on base easily enough (three
in the first, then one or more for
the next four innings), but
couldn't get 'em across. Bruin
catcher Bill Leßlanc wasn't overly
cooperative, of course —he threw
out four Stanford runners during
the first six innings.

But Hodges' homer, following
a walk to Mark Marquess, put the
Tribe on the board in the sixth,
and set the stage for the ninth.
Jack Lynn, sent in to hit for Mike
Ewing by Coach Young, led off
the frame with a single, making
his boss look brilliant in the
process. Shortstop Russ Tweet
then sacrificed Lynn to second,
and, an out and a walk later, third
baseman Chuck Williams punched
a two-out single to score Lynn
and give the Tribe the 3-2 lead.

inning. When a hit batsman and a
walk threatened to turn the
seventh into a disaster too, Young
went to his bull pen for southpaw
sophomore Jim Coate.
Coate dumped so much water
on SC's potential fire that the
Coast Guard was nearly called in.
Situation: bases loaded, no outs.

Enter Young. Exit Poteete. Enter
Coate. Enter Trojan pinch-hitter.
Exit Trojan pinch-hitter (looks at
a third strike). Enter Trojan

homer and single in three trips.
Exit Perkins (hits into 5-4-3
double-play). Coate retired the
side in the eighth and ninth
frames, striking out the last two
hitters, to wrap up a piece of
sensational relief and, not
incidentally, the game.
Proving that Southern
California smog may indeed have
its salutary effects, Stanford's
Indians trekked south last
weekend and won two out of
three baseball games. And, in an
impressive weekend, they nearly
won the third.
Taking on two of the best
teams in the nation, the Tribe
ended up in a trio of tight games,
all dominated by fine
pitching—which just happens to
be Stanford's main weapon. On
Friday, Bob Boone hurled a seven
hitter and Jack Hodges homered
as the Indians edged UCLA, 3-2.
On Saturday USC's Trojans took
the opener of a double-header
from Stanford by a big 1-0
margin, then were beaten in the
nightcap, 4-3, mainly because of a
sensational relief stint by
sophomore Jim Coate.
Last night Stanford played a
non-league game against the
number one ranked Santa Clara
Broncos in San Jose.
Stanford had to come from
behind to win the UCLA game.
The Bruins scored on three singles
in the first, then added their
second run on a leadoff homer by
Steve Shedd in the third. The
Tribe, meanwhile, was getting
men on base easily enough (three
in the first, then one or more for
the next four innings), but
couldn't get 'em across. Bruin
catcher Bill Leßlanc wasn't overly
cooperative, of course —he threw
out four Stanford runners during
the first six innings.

But Hodges' homer, following
a walk to Mark Marquess, put the
Tribe on the board in the sixth,
and set the stage for the ninth.
Jack Lynn, sent in to hit for Mike
Ewing by Coach Young, led off
the frame with a single, making
his boss look brilliant in the
process. Shortstop Russ Tweet
then sacrificed Lynn to second,
and, an out and a walk later, third
baseman Chuck Williams punched
a two-out single to score Lynn
and give the Tribe the 3-2 lead.
The victory was insured when
Boone retired the side in the
bottom half of the inning, getting
Shedd, his last man, to take a
third strike. In all, Boone walked
five and struck out 12—a pretty
fair performance for a rookie
moundsman in his Pac-8 debut.
Boone returned to his old
haunt—third base (he was
all-league there last year)—as the
Indians took on USC in
Saturday's double-header. The
Tribe fell behind in the first
inning, and they could have
stopped it right there. Stanford's
starter Phil Keller walked the
leadoff hitter, then saw him score
two outs later on a triple by first
baseman Bill Seinsoth (who led
the league last year with a .429
average), and that was it, baby.
Aside from a single by Boone
in the third and a couple more by

Hodges and Williams in the
seventh (and last) inning, all the
Tribe could manage were a few
loud fouls. Keller fanned ten, gave
up four hits and walked two while
taking the loss—a tough one.
Showing that Stanford
students can learn even quicker
than you think, the Tribe came
right back to open the second
game with a run from the leadoff
hitter. Marquess opened the game
with a triple, then scored on a
wild pitch, and presto . . . Stan
ford 1, USC zip. But, unlike the
first game, this one wasn't over.
Rod Poteete, the lanky ace of
the Tribe staff, suffered the
revolting development of being
tagged for three home runs in the
fourth, which put the Card heroes
behind, 3-1. But one run was
chipped from that deficit when

the Indians scored in the fifth on
a double by catcher Bob Edie and
three walks. Then, in the sixth,
Williams scored on a passed ball
after reaching base on a single,
and Poteete singled in second
baseman Dick Borchers for what
proved to be the winning run.
Poteete ran into some trouble
in the bottom half of the sixth,
but was bailed out of what could
have been a disastrous hole by
Hodges (left-field)-Boone-Edie
double play which ended the
inning. When a hit batsman and a
walk threatened to turn the
seventh into a disaster too, Young
went to his bull pen for southpaw
sophomore Jim Coate.
Coate dumped so much water
on SC's potential fire that the
Coast Guard was nearly called in.
Situation: bases loaded, no outs.

Enter Young. Exit Poteete. Enter
Coate. Enter Trojan pinch-hitter.
Exit Trojan pinch-hitter (looks at
