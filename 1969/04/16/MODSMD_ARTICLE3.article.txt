### 
To all members of the Stanford
Community, including:
a) Faculty—tenure and non-tenure
(including teaching assistants, fellows,
etc.)
b) S t u d en ts—includ ing those
registered and those eligible to register
without formal application
c) Staff and others
The Stanford Judicial Council hereby
notifies you, individually and
collectively:
I)That in accordance with the
request of the University President, the
Council hereby takes jurisdiction over
disciplinary matters arising from the
occupation of the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and any disruption of
activities thereof.
2) That the Council will on
Wednesday, April 16, 1969, at 3:15
p.m., in Room 163E of the Stanford
Law School, hold hearings regarding the
status of events in and around the
Applied Electronics Laboratory solely
for the purpose of determining whether
the campus policy on distruptions has
been or is being violated in order to
decide whether or not some action
should be taken prospectively,

subsequent to such hearings, to protect
the safety and tranquility of the
campus.
3) That the sole issue at such
hearings will be whether or not, or to
what extent, the normal activities of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory are
interfered with in violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. No charges against specific
individuals will be brought at this time
nor will any matters be heard regarding
acts committed by specified individuals
or their motives or any penalties for
such acts that have been committed.
4) The Council has unsuccessfully
attempted to have those involved in the
demonstration name an individual to
represent their interests at the hearing.
Therefore, the Council will endeavor to
appoint at the earliest possible moment
an appropriate individual to represent
those members of the community
interested in eliciting facts showing that
no disruption has occurred or that the
level of such disruption is less than it
otherwise might appear.
Ily Order of the Stanford Judicial
Con ncil
