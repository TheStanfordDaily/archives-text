# Candlelight Ceremony
## Pair Married In AEL Courtyard 
### SUSAN SWARD Society Editor 
Not every bride can have a smoke
bomb go off at her wedding and still
have the wedding be a success.
Carrie Iverson, a senior in music, was
the bride in the candlelight cermony in
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) courtyard last night before an
audience of about 500 people. The
groom was Marc Sapir, a medical
student.
In an informal celebration of their
union, Paul Rupert of the United
Christian Ministry made several
comments.
He announced to the audience that
Marc and Carrie had approached him in
the morning about the possibility of
their marriage being conducted in the
AEL courtyard. R ipert in turn checked
with the Coordinating Committee of the
April 3rd Coalition and with the general
meeting in the courtyard. Both groups
had given their approval to the
scheduling of the ceremony.
Smoke Bomb Highlight
Rupert was in the process of saying
that the ceremony was an event "that
grows out of what we're doing here"
when a smoke bomb was thrown into
the crowd from the roof. The smoke
bomb was carried away as Rupert
choked and continued,
"It certainly doesn't smell like most
churches," he said. Rupert had earlier
noted that he would deny that he was
presiding over the ceremony in any
"official" capacity just about as fast as
his church would deny it.
Rupert went on to make an analogy

between this ceremony and the wedding
shown in the "Battle of Algiers"—a
movie depicting the Algerian
revolutionary struggle against the
French. "That was one of the most
rapid weddings I have ever witnessed,
and at the time, it was one of the most
moving," he said.
The bride, Carrie Iverson, was then
asked by Rupert to come to the
microphone. Dressed simply in a blue
jacket and long pants, Carrie walked
through the audience to the
microphone.
Carrie Scorns Gown
As she approached the place where
she was to speak, a final detail of her
outfit became evident. Through her
long, dark hair were laced several
flowers of the different hues. Carrie
expressed in her speech a dislike for the
trappings of the wedding ceremony like
the wedding dress commonly displayed
in department store windows.
She spoke briefly to the group about
the institution of marriage in the
society. Marc Sapir, wearing dark pants
and a brown jacket, came to the
microphone after Carrie spoke and told
the group,
"I wish there were another word than
'marriage." He mentioned the fact that
marriage can be "a trap away from
collectivity."
After Sapir stopped speaking, Rupert
took the microphone again.
Whose Authority?
"I'm going to paraphrase Charles
Ducommun a bit," he said. He paused
and then asked the group, "By whose

authority are these people being
married?"
Just as the audience had shouted at
the March 11 panel meeting in Memorial
Auditorium, the group responded,
"OURS!"
The more formal part of the
ceremony stopped at this point. The
group then sang a song entitled
"Solidarity Forever," and a wedding
cake was passed out of the AEL
building through a window
Purple Light Shed
The cake was a four-layer creation
with two enormous purple candles in it.
The group then sang some new words
to the tune of "This Little Light of
Mine." According to the new verses, the
light is going to shine "all over" SRI,
the Stanford Trustees, Harvard
University and Vietnam—to name only a
few locations.
