# Senate Asks Curbs On Secret Research
## 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
The Academic Senate last night
called for the drafting of new policy
guidelines "which prohibit research
which involves secrecy of sponsorship or
results."
The vote for a "significant change"
in present policy came with a single
dissent after four and a half hours'
discussion.
The 53-member Senate asked the
Committee on Research Policies, headed
by Law Prof. William Baxter, to come
up with new research policy proposals
for the Sentate meeting on April 24.
The Senate passed the following
resolution:
"The Senate desires a significant
change in University research policy,
greater than that proposed in the April
15 majority report of the Committee on
Research Policy.
"We request that the Committee
prepare for the April 24 meeting of the
Senate new research policy guidelines
which prohibit research which involves
secrecy of sponsorship or results.
"We further desire that after April
24, the Committee addresses itself to
the issue of how the University can
bring about a further reordering of our
own research priorities and to a
reordering of research priorities of the
federal government agencies, reporting
as soon as practicable on these two
issues.
"The term secrecy as used in the
foregoing shall be defined in the terms
used in the following excerpt from a
minority report of the Committee:
No Contract
"The University should enter no
contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that
restrain the freedom of the University
to disclose known applications of the
research.
"The University should enter no
contract and accept no grant to carry
out research if there is a substantial
possibility that foreseeable results of the
research will be subjected by the
sponsor to restrictions on the
publication of research results, for a
period in excess of that reasonably
required for the sponsor to ascertain
whether classified information would be
disclosed by publication."
President Kenneth Pitzer told the
Senate he felt it was "entirely
reasonable" to press toward elimination

of secrecy. Doing so minimizes the
"great danger" of attempting to legislate
"vague moral aspects" of research.
If research is open, everyone has the
right to discuss it without restriction, he
noted. "If anything is sufficiently
reprehensible, sufficient moral pressure
can be brought to bear" to change it.
At present, Stanford has 13 classified
research contracts, each of which is
screened by the Committee on Research
Policy in accord with earlier guidelines
approved by the faculty.
Under those guidelines adopted by
the faculty two years ago, the number
of classified contracts on campus has
dropped from more than 20 to the
current 13. Several are regarded as
classified because access to classified
details is necessary for the completion
of the work.
'Sense Of Senate'
Last night's faculty action, therefore,
represents a "sense of the Senate" that
classified research —which the Senate
chose to call "secret" research—should
be veritably ended. It commissioned
Baxter's Research Policy Committee to
hammer out the details of such
guidelines in time for the Senate's April
24 meeting.
Law Prof. Baxter announced to the
Seante that his committee had "agreed
on very little" in its closed meeting
yesterday."The committee is aware of
the sense of urgency of this matter, but
was unable to make significant progress
toward a solution."
Baxter reported that his committee

arrived upon no new research policy
guidelines for presentation to the
Senate, and instead presented a majority
report from his committee that clarified
minor points of the classified research
guidelines.
One point adopted was that the
committee's descriptive statements of
classified projects should include at least
one paragraph describing both the
military and non-military application
which the committee deemed probable.
Baxter responded directly to pointed
and widely circulated criticism of his
summary descriptions of classified
research projects. He said he wrote the
titles from notes in his office, and not
from the contracts themselves. In 12
out of 14 cases, the summaries used
different words than the official
description.
Two minority reports from the
Research Policies Committee strongly
chastized the committee's deliberations.
One member, Pierre Noyes of SLAC,
called for an unequivocal end to
classified research. He then announced
his resignation from the committee.
Another committee member,
economics student Michael Sweeney,
doubted the "willingness of the
committee to form new guidelines."
He called for restrictions against
classified and military-related contracts,
along with advocating the creation of a
committee to be set up to investigate
applied research areas that have been
"long-neglected," and to seek funding
for this type of work.

The 53-member Senate asked the
Committee on Research Policies, headed
by Law Prof. William Baxter, to come
up with new research policy proposals
for the Sentate meeting on April 24.
The Senate passed the following
resolution:
"The Senate desires a significant
change in University research policy,
greater than that proposed in the April
15 majority report of the Committee on
Research Policy.
"We request that the Committee
prepare for the April 24 meeting of the
Senate new research policy guidelines
which prohibit research which involves
secrecy of sponsorship or results.
"We further desire that after April
24, the Committee addresses itself to
the issue of how the University can
bring about a further reordering of our
own research priorities and to a
reordering of research priorities of the
federal government agencies, reporting
as soon as practicable on these two
issues.
"The term secrecy as used in the
foregoing shall be defined in the terms
used in the following excerpt from a
minority report of the Committee:
No Contract
"The University should enter no
contract and accept no grant to carry
out research under circumstances that
restrain the freedom of the University
to disclose known applications of the
research.
"The University should enter no
contract and accept no grant to carry
out research if there is a substantial
possibility that foreseeable results of the
research will be subjected by the
sponsor to restrictions on the
publication of research results, for a
period in excess of that reasonably
required for the sponsor to ascertain
whether classified information would be
disclosed by publication."
President Kenneth Pitzer told the
Senate he felt it was "entirely
reasonable" to press toward elimination

of secrecy. Doing so minimizes the
"great danger" of attempting to legislate
"vague moral aspects" of research.
If research is open, everyone has the
right to discuss it without restriction, he
noted. "If anything is sufficiently
reprehensible, sufficient moral pressure
can be brought to bear" to change it.
At present, Stanford has 13 classified
research contracts, each of which is
screened by the Committee on Research
Policy in accord with earlier guidelines
approved by the faculty.
Under those guidelines adopted by
the faculty two years ago, the number
of classified contracts on campus has
dropped from more than 20 to the
current 13. Several are regarded as
classified because access to classified
details is necessary for the completion
of the work.
'Sense Of Senate'
Last night's faculty action, therefore,
represents a "sense of the Senate" that
classified research —which the Senate
chose to call "secret" research—should
be veritably ended. It commissioned
Baxter's Research Policy Committee to
hammer out the details of such
guidelines in time for the Senate's April
24 meeting.
Law Prof. Baxter announced to the
Seante that his committee had "agreed
on very little" in its closed meeting
yesterday."The committee is aware of
the sense of urgency of this matter, but
was unable to make significant progress
toward a solution."
Baxter reported that his committee

arrived upon no new research policy
guidelines for presentation to the
Senate, and instead presented a majority
report from his committee that clarified
minor points of the classified research
guidelines.
One point adopted was that the
committee's descriptive statements of
classified projects should include at least
one paragraph describing both the
military and non-military application
which the committee deemed probable.
Baxter responded directly to pointed
and widely circulated criticism of his
summary descriptions of classified
research projects. He said he wrote the
titles from notes in his office, and not
from the contracts themselves. In 12
out of 14 cases, the summaries used
different words than the official
description.
Two minority reports from the
Research Policies Committee strongly
chastized the committee's deliberations.
One member, Pierre Noyes of SLAC,
called for an unequivocal end to
classified research. He then announced
his resignation from the committee.
Another committee member,
economics student Michael Sweeney,
doubted the "willingness of the
committee to form new guidelines."
He called for restrictions against
classified and military-related contracts,
along with advocating the creation of a
committee to be set up to investigate
applied research areas that have been
"long-neglected," and to seek funding
for this type of work.
The Academic Senate last night
called for the drafting of new policy
guidelines "which prohibit research
which involves secrecy of sponsorship or
results."
The vote for a "significant change"
in present policy came with a single
dissent after four and a half hours'
discussion.
