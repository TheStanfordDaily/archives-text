WASHINGTON (AP)-A U.S. aircraft
searching for the Navy reconnaissance
plane and 31 men which North Korea
claims to have shot down reported
sighting debris in the sea of Japan, the
Pentagon reported Tuesday night.
The P3 patrol plane directed two
Russian destroyers to the scene of the
debris in an effort to identify it as the
humpbacked Navy super Constellation
missing with its crew and cargo of
electronics gear.

The Pentagon said the Soviet
destroyers were the closest ships to the
scene and were cooperating. The U.S.
embassy in Moscow had earlier asked
the Soviet government to assist in the
search.
No survivors had been reported, the
Pentagon spokesman said late Tuesday
night. Meanwhile Vice President Spiro
T. Agnew said in Manchester, N.H., his
information is that the unarmed plane
was attacked by two MIG jets.
Investigation Promised
"We are in the process of making a
complete investigation," Agnew said. He
said President Nixon would have
"something to say" after the
investigation produces more facts.
In Seoul, a United Nations command
spokesman said North Korea has
requested a meeting of the Military
Armistice Commission Friday. There is
speculation it will deal with the
incident.
Sources in Seoul said U.S. and South
Korean Air Force units in South Korea
are on special alert.
Debris Gives Clue
Spotting of the debris in the first
hours of daylight Wednesday, far
eastern time, was the first evidence
reported from the search zone that the
Navy ECI2I aircraft might have been
destroyed as the North Koreans
claimed.
Earlier, in the darkness, search planes
had dropped flares and there was a
report that dim lights had been spotted.
"This debris could be associated with
the missing aircraft," a statement issued
at the Pentagon said. "No survivors have
been reported."
