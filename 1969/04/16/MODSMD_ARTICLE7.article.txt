# Reagan: Oust Students Hayes: Who Are You?
## 
### 
Gov. Ronald Reagan declared
yesterday that he thought Stanford
officials should oust the demonstrators
sitting-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL).
Reagan told a press conference, "I
think the administration should do what
they did at Harvard and go in there and
get them out."
ASSU President Denis Hayes
telegraphed an immediate response to
the governor's comments:
"Your administration has severely
crippled the University of California and
nearly destroyed the State College
system. Now who in hell do you think
you are to tell Kenneth Pitzer how to
deal with Stanford?
"The Stanford community does not
consider the witless blundering of
Rafferty and the heavy-handed
authoritarianism of Hayakawa, Kirk,
Pusey, Hessburg, etc. to have
illuminated wise pathways of
enlightened college leadership. We have
therefore decided to pursue a different
course—a course of non-violence and
reason.
"The students, faculty, and
administration of Stanford University
are more than capable of handling any
disturbances which occur on our
campus. We would all appreciate your
confining your maladroit blundering to
affairs of state."
The University issued its own reply
to Reagan's statements which included
his personal opinion that Stanford
officials have failed to recognize "the
nature of the revolt that is going on."
"Since the sit-in began, both

President Kenneth Pitzer and Provost
Richard Lyman have made it clear that
the university intends to make every
effort to use its own internal judicial
processes in attempting to end this
disruption.
"These processes have been formally
sanctioned by both students and faculty
this year.
"As Provost Lyman told Young
Americans for Freedom Monday, 'The
results of using off-campus methods to
end disorders elsewhere have not been
especially happy or encouraging. This is
not to say that the use of civil authority
is not ever necessary. Sometimes it is."
Reagan explained his call for a forced
removal of the AEL demonstrators by
saying of the sit-in, "I think it is this
kind of action that leads to further
violence on the part of the rebels."
There has been no violence at
Stanford associated with the sit-in.
The governor claimed the
demonstration constitutes "an
infringement on the rights of others
who are paying a tuition to go to that
school," as well as those teaching or
doing research.
