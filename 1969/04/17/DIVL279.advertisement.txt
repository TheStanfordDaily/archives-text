Bouncing
Around
\ for Stereo?
No need to wander thither and yon. You'll find
an impressive array of brand names such as
Fisher, Scott, Dyna, KLH, AR and many others at
Lafayette—plus the outstanding values of our
own make.
Whether you're looking for separate compon
ents, stereo compacts, table radios, or portables
—tape recorders or phonos—Lafayette has the
selection and values.
Our new, much-enlarged store in the Mountain
View Shopping Center, at El Camino and Grant
Road, is the place to go for (you should pardon
the pun) sound values!
