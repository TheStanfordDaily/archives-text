# Hayes Calls Friday Student Body Meeting Pitzer Blasts Sit-In; SJC Deliberates
## SJC Considers Sit-In 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
Dean of Students Joel Smith early
this morning made a dramatic and
eloquent plea to the Stanford Judicial
Council recommending that they advise
President Kenneth Pitzer to suspend any
students who remain in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory after a warning
to leave.
The Council deliberated for more
than an hour and adjourned until today.
No decision was announced.
Besides suspension, other options
open to the Council included finding
that there was no violation of the
demonstrations policy, fines as an
alternative to suspension or a
declaration that the policy has in fact
been broken and that more hearings will
be held.
Smith was appearing before a hearing
of the Judicial Council called to
determine whether the campus
disruption policy is being violated by
the prolonged occupation of AEL. The
hearing began at 3:30 yesterday
afternoon, adjourned at 7:15,
reconvened at 10 and finally went into
deliberations at one this morning.
Though the matter is not entirely
clear, the suspensions would apparently
be temporary, pending later hearings by
the Council. Both Friedenthal and
Smith indicated that any forthcoming
suspensions would be temporary, but it
was not clear just what form later
hearings might take.
Calling his recommendation "a
desperate last hope against alternatives I
regard as grim," Smith cited three
factors which led to his decision. They
were the threat of escalation by
sit-inners, the possibility of retaliation
by persons disgruntled with the
occupation of AEL and the possibility
of "police activity over which the
University may not have control."
"Police activity" refers to the
possibility that police might be called in
to protect the classified information in
the AEL building. Smith revealed that
consultations have been held with
Federal authorities on the matter and
that thus far the University had
persuaded them not to act.
The spectre of a constitutional crisis
also materialized last night when the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) voted to promulgate a rule, not
effective for at least 45 days, which
would, in effect, prohibit what the
Council appears to be contemplating,
suspension, albeit temporary
suspension, without a full hearing
before the Council.
Informed of this action during the
evening hearing, SJC chairman
Friedenthal was visibly angered, stating
that he intended to write a letter of
protest to SCLC. He said, "I am
incensed. I reagrd this as a grave breach

of etiquette and jurisdiction." None of
the Council objected to his statement.
At the afternoon session an AEL
researcher testified that he had been
threatened with death by an enraged
demonstrator whom he encountered
near his office.
The threat of death was made to
Alexander Sawchuk, Ph.D. candidate in
electrical engineering from Silver Spring,
Md., who told the Council he entered
his laboratory Monday and "surprised
three people in the laser area examining
equipment, turning over papers, and
rearranging everything."
When Sawchuk asked them to leave
they told him the demonstration's
policy was not to damage anything in
the building. He repeated his request,
and two left.
"But one was particularly upset," he
continued, "shouted obscenities, and
said if I asked him again to leave he
would kill me. I left."
Most of the afternoon session was
devoted to questioning AEL employees
as to whether they felt their work was
being stopped by the sit-in. Five
employees testified that they had been
prevented from carrying on their normal
activities.
The Council, at the beginning of its
marathon session, appointed law school
teaching fellow Richard Kuhns to act as
appointed defense counsel representing
the interests of those sitting-in. Kuhn
stated, and the Council agreed, that he
was acting not as the representative of
the sit-inners but rather was acting in
their interests. The sit-inners had earlier
voted not to participate in the Council
hearings.
In bringing up the possibility of
suspension Council members used the
mass refusal to cooperate with the
Council as well as the refusal to give
names to investigators as reasons they
were considering the action.

of etiquette and jurisdiction." None of
the Council objected to his statement.
At the afternoon session an AEL
researcher testified that he had been
threatened with death by an enraged
demonstrator whom he encountered
near his office.
The threat of death was made to
Alexander Sawchuk, Ph.D. candidate in
electrical engineering from Silver Spring,
Md., who told the Council he entered
his laboratory Monday and "surprised
three people in the laser area examining
equipment, turning over papers, and
rearranging everything."
When Sawchuk asked them to leave
they told him the demonstration's
policy was not to damage anything in
the building. He repeated his request,
and two left.
"But one was particularly upset," he
continued, "shouted obscenities, and
said if I asked him again to leave he
would kill me. I left."
Most of the afternoon session was
devoted to questioning AEL employees
as to whether they felt their work was
being stopped by the sit-in. Five
employees testified that they had been
prevented from carrying on their normal
activities.
The Council, at the beginning of its
marathon session, appointed law school
teaching fellow Richard Kuhns to act as
appointed defense counsel representing
the interests of those sitting-in. Kuhn
stated, and the Council agreed, that he
was acting not as the representative of
the sit-inners but rather was acting in
their interests. The sit-inners had earlier
voted not to participate in the Council
hearings.
In bringing up the possibility of
suspension Council members used the
mass refusal to cooperate with the
Council as well as the refusal to give
names to investigators as reasons they
were considering the action.

Dean of Students Joel Smith early
this morning made a dramatic and
eloquent plea to the Stanford Judicial
Council recommending that they advise
President Kenneth Pitzer to suspend any
students who remain in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory after a warning
to leave.
The Council deliberated for more
than an hour and adjourned until today.
No decision was announced.
Besides suspension, other options
open to the Council included finding
that there was no violation of the
demonstrations policy, fines as an
alternative to suspension or a
declaration that the policy has in fact
been broken and that more hearings will
be held.
Smith was appearing before a hearing
of the Judicial Council called to
determine whether the campus
disruption policy is being violated by
the prolonged occupation of AEL. The
hearing began at 3:30 yesterday
afternoon, adjourned at 7:15,
reconvened at 10 and finally went into
deliberations at one this morning.
Though the matter is not entirely
clear, the suspensions would apparently
be temporary, pending later hearings by
the Council. Both Friedenthal and
Smith indicated that any forthcoming
suspensions would be temporary, but it
was not clear just what form later
hearings might take.
Calling his recommendation "a
desperate last hope against alternatives I
regard as grim," Smith cited three
factors which led to his decision. They
were the threat of escalation by
sit-inners, the possibility of retaliation
by persons disgruntled with the
occupation of AEL and the possibility
of "police activity over which the
University may not have control."
"Police activity" refers to the
possibility that police might be called in
to protect the classified information in
the AEL building. Smith revealed that
consultations have been held with
Federal authorities on the matter and
that thus far the University had
persuaded them not to act.
The spectre of a constitutional crisis
also materialized last night when the
Student Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) voted to promulgate a rule, not
effective for at least 45 days, which
would, in effect, prohibit what the
Council appears to be contemplating,
suspension, albeit temporary
suspension, without a full hearing
before the Council.
Informed of this action during the
evening hearing, SJC chairman
Friedenthal was visibly angered, stating
that he intended to write a letter of
protest to SCLC. He said, "I am
incensed. I reagrd this as a grave breach

of etiquette and jurisdiction." None of
the Council objected to his statement.
