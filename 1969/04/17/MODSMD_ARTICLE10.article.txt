## 'Harvard Way' Seen As Wrong Way 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a graduate student here at
Stanford, and a recent graduate of
Harvard, I have followed with a
great deal of interest and sense of
involvement, the recent events on
these two campuses. The
differences between what has
transpired on these two campuses
is indeed striking.
Last Wednesday, after failing
to win a majority within their
own organization, a small group
of radical students entered the
Harvard administration building,
forcibly evicted its occupants, and
chained and locked themselves
within its walls, after which they
began to break into the
University's confidential files.
Here at Stanford, that same
evening, a mass meeting voted to
occupy the AEL. This building
has remained open to the
community, and few, if any,
incidents of vandalism have
occurred.
At Harvard, President Pusey,
against the advice of the Deans
and of the House Masters, decided
to call in local and state "troops"
to oust the radicals. Here,
President Pitzer and the
Administration have decided to
handle the "problem" through
internal means.
And now, Reagan and,
doubtless, many alumni, are
asking why old "second-best
Stanford" can't do things the
"Harvard way." What they are
saying is that the situation
currently existing at Harvard is
preferable to the one existing
here. It sounds an awful lot like
the line of reasoning used by that
immortal colonel (or lieutenant)
during the TET offensive when he
said that "It became necessary to
destroy the village in order to save
it." What they are saying is to hell
with the feelings and opinions of
faculty and students alike, the
function of an administrator is to
wield power, it doesn't matter
what he does with it.
President Pusey has now joined
the ranks of the Hayakawa's and
the Hesburgh's and all the others
who believe that the answer to
today's problems is the use of
armed might. President Pitzer, as
yet, has not joined this august
body of the champions of
brutality. I for one, hope and pray
that he never does.
I firmly support the sit-in, as
long as it remains in the spirit in
which it was started. Likewise, I
condemn the irresponsible
ramblings of the pompous idiot

who governs this state. Right now,
I am very much ashamed of my
alma mater, let's not let the same
thing happen here.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to express my
opposition to the telegram sent to
Governor Reagan by Denis Hayes.
By virtue of receiving more votes
than a topless dancer, Mr. Hayes
apparently feels qualified to speak
for "the Stanford community."
On the contrary, several student
referenda this year have indicated
that Mr. Hayes does not even have
the support of the student body,
much less that of "the Stanford
community." My guess is that
Governor Reagan is a great deal
more legitimately able to speak
for his constituency, the people of
the State of California.
I do not feel that the Reagan
administration has "crippled the
University of California and
nearly destroyed the State College
system." What damage has been
done can more likely by charged
to the SDS and the BSU. In
passing, Mr. Hayes accuses
President Hayakawa of San
Francisco State of "heavy-handed
authoritarianism." My personal
feeling is that SF State would
probably have burned down if it
hadn't been for the courageous
efforts of S.I. Hayakawa.
History will determine what
course of action is most effective
in quelling the uprisings of small
groups of extremist students. I
contend that history will show
that peace on campus is more
effectively attained by the
immediate use of lawful force
against those who violate
University and civil regulations.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to draw the
attention of the Stanford
community to certain insidious
invasions of civil rights that are
wrongfully being tolerated.
Yesterday's Dail) reported that
AEL demonstrators discovered
documents on Prof. Rambo's desk
linking him with a society
dedicated to electronic warfare. I
ask: what were those
demonstrators doing at Prof.
Rambo's desk?
The fourth amendment to the
U.S. Constitution guarantees "the
right of the people to be secure in
their houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and
seizures." Unfortunately, Prof.
Rambo's right to privacy exists
only to the extent he is willing to
demand it, by recourse to the
courts, if necessary. But I'm sure
thai both he and the university
are too afraid of antagonizing the

demonstrators to take any such
action.
Of course, there have been
many instances in the present
sit-in of locked offices being
invaded and private papers
confiscated. The same tactic was
used at Harvard and Columbia.
And Tuesday's Daily reported
that Steve Weissman, addressing
the AEL demonstrators, urged
them not to condemn those who
would take personal or even
classified files, for such files have
been ''important to the
movement."
I condemn such invasions of
privacy for whatever reasons and
urge those who have been
wronged to enforce their rights
through legal channels.
Not long ago many people on
this campus were whining because
marijuana was found in a
student's library locker, and he
got into legal trouble as a result.
Yes, the double standard is
alive and well at Stanford.

To the dissident Foreign
Students:
Yesterday's letter by four
students from Norway requires
some clarification from my side.
1) The International
Association is not only a group of
Foreign Students. The
Constitution clearly states: . . .the
I. A. shall provide for the
representation and association of
Foreign and American students
concerned with international
activities on campus and for all
aspects of these activities (Para.
II).

2) The sit-in is clearly of major
concern to us, since we are
especially concerned with CBW
and military research conducted
against foreign countries and third
world people, which the
statement of support clearly
indicates:
''We the International
Association, composed of Foreign
and American Students feel very
strongly the need, in the present
circumstances, to state our firm
support to you students directly
engaged in struggle with Stanford
on SRI war activities.
As human beings we are hKe
you concerned in the first place
with the issues raised on chemical
and biological warfare,
counter-insurgency and other
military research, mainly directed
against the third world people.
Your fight is our fight as well.
We salute the present struggle of
students against the American war
machine.
Our support will always go to
those students against racism and
imperialism throughout the
world."
3) The resolution was passed by
a clear majority. Since the Policy
Board of the I.A. has the final
deliberative and decision-making
power in all matters of policy, we
exercised this right on a very
crucial issue. Those people outside
should present their viewpoints
directly to the Policy Board or
through the election and
referendum on Political Issues on
May 6th.

I would like to express my
opposition to the telegram sent to
Governor Reagan by Denis Hayes.
By virtue of receiving more votes
than a topless dancer, Mr. Hayes
apparently feels qualified to speak
for "the Stanford community."
On the contrary, several student
referenda this year have indicated
that Mr. Hayes does not even have
the support of the student body,
much less that of "the Stanford
community." My guess is that
Governor Reagan is a great deal
more legitimately able to speak
for his constituency, the people of
the State of California.
I do not feel that the Reagan
administration has "crippled the
University of California and
nearly destroyed the State College
system." What damage has been
done can more likely by charged
to the SDS and the BSU. In
passing, Mr. Hayes accuses
President Hayakawa of San
Francisco State of "heavy-handed
authoritarianism." My personal
feeling is that SF State would
probably have burned down if it
hadn't been for the courageous
efforts of S.I. Hayakawa.
History will determine what
course of action is most effective
in quelling the uprisings of small
groups of extremist students. I
contend that history will show
that peace on campus is more
effectively attained by the
immediate use of lawful force
against those who violate
University and civil regulations.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to draw the
attention of the Stanford
community to certain insidious
invasions of civil rights that are
wrongfully being tolerated.
Yesterday's Dail) reported that
AEL demonstrators discovered
documents on Prof. Rambo's desk
linking him with a society
dedicated to electronic warfare. I
ask: what were those
demonstrators doing at Prof.
Rambo's desk?
The fourth amendment to the
U.S. Constitution guarantees "the
right of the people to be secure in
their houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and
seizures." Unfortunately, Prof.
Rambo's right to privacy exists
only to the extent he is willing to
demand it, by recourse to the
courts, if necessary. But I'm sure
thai both he and the university
are too afraid of antagonizing the

demonstrators to take any such
action.
Of course, there have been
many instances in the present
sit-in of locked offices being
invaded and private papers
confiscated. The same tactic was
used at Harvard and Columbia.
And Tuesday's Daily reported
that Steve Weissman, addressing
the AEL demonstrators, urged
them not to condemn those who
would take personal or even
classified files, for such files have
been ''important to the
movement."
I condemn such invasions of
privacy for whatever reasons and
urge those who have been
wronged to enforce their rights
through legal channels.
Not long ago many people on
this campus were whining because
marijuana was found in a
student's library locker, and he
got into legal trouble as a result.
Yes, the double standard is
alive and well at Stanford.

To the dissident Foreign
Students:
Yesterday's letter by four
students from Norway requires
some clarification from my side.
1) The International
Association is not only a group of
Foreign Students. The
Constitution clearly states: . . .the
I. A. shall provide for the
representation and association of
Foreign and American students
concerned with international
activities on campus and for all
aspects of these activities (Para.
II).

2) The sit-in is clearly of major
concern to us, since we are
especially concerned with CBW
and military research conducted
against foreign countries and third
world people, which the
statement of support clearly
indicates:
''We the International
Association, composed of Foreign
and American Students feel very
strongly the need, in the present
circumstances, to state our firm
support to you students directly
engaged in struggle with Stanford
on SRI war activities.
As human beings we are hKe
you concerned in the first place
with the issues raised on chemical
and biological warfare,
counter-insurgency and other
military research, mainly directed
against the third world people.
Your fight is our fight as well.
We salute the present struggle of
students against the American war
machine.
Our support will always go to
those students against racism and
imperialism throughout the
world."
3) The resolution was passed by
a clear majority. Since the Policy
Board of the I.A. has the final
deliberative and decision-making
power in all matters of policy, we
exercised this right on a very
crucial issue. Those people outside
should present their viewpoints
directly to the Policy Board or
through the election and
referendum on Political Issues on
May 6th.

As a graduate student here at
Stanford, and a recent graduate of
Harvard, I have followed with a
great deal of interest and sense of
involvement, the recent events on
these two campuses. The
differences between what has
transpired on these two campuses
is indeed striking.
Last Wednesday, after failing
to win a majority within their
own organization, a small group
of radical students entered the
Harvard administration building,
forcibly evicted its occupants, and
chained and locked themselves
within its walls, after which they
began to break into the
University's confidential files.
Here at Stanford, that same
evening, a mass meeting voted to
occupy the AEL. This building
has remained open to the
community, and few, if any,
incidents of vandalism have
occurred.
At Harvard, President Pusey,
against the advice of the Deans
and of the House Masters, decided
to call in local and state "troops"
to oust the radicals. Here,
President Pitzer and the
Administration have decided to
handle the "problem" through
internal means.
And now, Reagan and,
doubtless, many alumni, are
asking why old "second-best
Stanford" can't do things the
"Harvard way." What they are
saying is that the situation
currently existing at Harvard is
preferable to the one existing
here. It sounds an awful lot like
the line of reasoning used by that
immortal colonel (or lieutenant)
during the TET offensive when he
said that "It became necessary to
destroy the village in order to save
it." What they are saying is to hell
with the feelings and opinions of
faculty and students alike, the
function of an administrator is to
wield power, it doesn't matter
what he does with it.
President Pusey has now joined
the ranks of the Hayakawa's and
the Hesburgh's and all the others
who believe that the answer to
today's problems is the use of
armed might. President Pitzer, as
yet, has not joined this august
body of the champions of
brutality. I for one, hope and pray
that he never does.
I firmly support the sit-in, as
long as it remains in the spirit in
which it was started. Likewise, I
condemn the irresponsible
ramblings of the pompous idiot

who governs this state. Right now,
I am very much ashamed of my
alma mater, let's not let the same

Of course, there have been

confiscated. The same tactic was

I condemn such invasions of

To the dissident Foreign
Students:
Yesterday's letter by four
students from Norway requires
some clarification from my side.
1) The International
Association is not only a group of
Foreign Students. The
Constitution clearly states: . . .the
I. A. shall provide for the
representation and association of
Foreign and American students
concerned with international
activities on campus and for all
aspects of these activities (Para.
II).

2) The sit-in is clearly of major
concern to us, since we are
especially concerned with CBW
and military research conducted
against foreign countries and third
world people, which the
statement of support clearly
indicates:
''We the International
Association, composed of Foreign
and American Students feel very
strongly the need, in the present
circumstances, to state our firm
support to you students directly
engaged in struggle with Stanford
on SRI war activities.
As human beings we are hKe
you concerned in the first place
with the issues raised on chemical
and biological warfare,
counter-insurgency and other
military research, mainly directed
against the third world people.
Your fight is our fight as well.
We salute the present struggle of
students against the American war
machine.
Our support will always go to
those students against racism and
imperialism throughout the
world."
3) The resolution was passed by
a clear majority. Since the Policy
Board of the I.A. has the final
deliberative and decision-making
power in all matters of policy, we
exercised this right on a very
crucial issue. Those people outside
should present their viewpoints
directly to the Policy Board or
through the election and
referendum on Political Issues on
May 6th.

As a graduate student here at
Stanford, and a recent graduate of
Harvard, I have followed with a
great deal of interest and sense of
involvement, the recent events on
these two campuses. The
differences between what has
transpired on these two campuses
is indeed striking.
Last Wednesday, after failing
to win a majority within their
own organization, a small group
of radical students entered the
Harvard administration building,
forcibly evicted its occupants, and
chained and locked themselves
within its walls, after which they
began to break into the
University's confidential files.
Here at Stanford, that same
evening, a mass meeting voted to
occupy the AEL. This building
has remained open to the
community, and few, if any,
incidents of vandalism have
occurred.
At Harvard, President Pusey,
against the advice of the Deans
and of the House Masters, decided
to call in local and state "troops"
to oust the radicals. Here,
President Pitzer and the
Administration have decided to
handle the "problem" through
internal means.
And now, Reagan and,
doubtless, many alumni, are
asking why old "second-best
Stanford" can't do things the
"Harvard way." What they are
saying is that the situation
currently existing at Harvard is
preferable to the one existing
here. It sounds an awful lot like
the line of reasoning used by that
immortal colonel (or lieutenant)
during the TET offensive when he
said that "It became necessary to
destroy the village in order to save
it." What they are saying is to hell
with the feelings and opinions of
faculty and students alike, the
function of an administrator is to
wield power, it doesn't matter
what he does with it.
President Pusey has now joined
the ranks of the Hayakawa's and
the Hesburgh's and all the others
who believe that the answer to
today's problems is the use of
armed might. President Pitzer, as
yet, has not joined this august
body of the champions of
brutality. I for one, hope and pray
that he never does.
I firmly support the sit-in, as
long as it remains in the spirit in
which it was started. Likewise, I
condemn the irresponsible
ramblings of the pompous idiot

who governs this state. Right now,
I am very much ashamed of my
alma mater, let's not let the same
thing happen here.

I would like to express my
opposition to the telegram sent to
Governor Reagan by Denis Hayes.
By virtue of receiving more votes
than a topless dancer, Mr. Hayes
apparently feels qualified to speak
for "the Stanford community."
On the contrary, several student
referenda this year have indicated
that Mr. Hayes does not even have
the support of the student body,
much less that of "the Stanford
community." My guess is that
Governor Reagan is a great deal
more legitimately able to speak
for his constituency, the people of
the State of California.
I do not feel that the Reagan
administration has "crippled the
University of California and
nearly destroyed the State College
system." What damage has been
done can more likely by charged
to the SDS and the BSU. In
passing, Mr. Hayes accuses
President Hayakawa of San
Francisco State of "heavy-handed
authoritarianism." My personal
feeling is that SF State would
probably have burned down if it
hadn't been for the courageous
efforts of S.I. Hayakawa.
History will determine what
course of action is most effective
in quelling the uprisings of small
groups of extremist students. I
contend that history will show
that peace on campus is more
effectively attained by the
immediate use of lawful force
against those who violate
University and civil regulations.

I would like to draw the

Yesterday's Dail) reported that

The fourth amendment to the

only to the extent he is willing to

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a graduate student here at
Stanford, and a recent graduate of
Harvard, I have followed with a
great deal of interest and sense of
involvement, the recent events on
these two campuses. The
differences between what has
transpired on these two campuses
is indeed striking.
Last Wednesday, after failing
to win a majority within their
own organization, a small group
of radical students entered the
Harvard administration building,
forcibly evicted its occupants, and
chained and locked themselves
within its walls, after which they
began to break into the
University's confidential files.
Here at Stanford, that same
evening, a mass meeting voted to
occupy the AEL. This building
has remained open to the
community, and few, if any,
incidents of vandalism have
occurred.
At Harvard, President Pusey,
against the advice of the Deans
and of the House Masters, decided
to call in local and state "troops"
to oust the radicals. Here,
President Pitzer and the
Administration have decided to
handle the "problem" through
internal means.
And now, Reagan and,
doubtless, many alumni, are
asking why old "second-best
Stanford" can't do things the
"Harvard way." What they are
saying is that the situation
currently existing at Harvard is
preferable to the one existing
here. It sounds an awful lot like
the line of reasoning used by that
immortal colonel (or lieutenant)
during the TET offensive when he
said that "It became necessary to
destroy the village in order to save
it." What they are saying is to hell
with the feelings and opinions of
faculty and students alike, the
function of an administrator is to
wield power, it doesn't matter
what he does with it.
President Pusey has now joined
the ranks of the Hayakawa's and
the Hesburgh's and all the others
who believe that the answer to
today's problems is the use of
armed might. President Pitzer, as
yet, has not joined this august
body of the champions of
brutality. I for one, hope and pray
that he never does.
I firmly support the sit-in, as
long as it remains in the spirit in
which it was started. Likewise, I
condemn the irresponsible
ramblings of the pompous idiot

who governs this state. Right now,
I am very much ashamed of my
alma mater, let's not let the same
thing happen here.

• Opposition
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to express my
opposition to the telegram sent to
Governor Reagan by Denis Hayes.
By virtue of receiving more votes
than a topless dancer, Mr. Hayes
apparently feels qualified to speak
for "the Stanford community."
On the contrary, several student
referenda this year have indicated
that Mr. Hayes does not even have
the support of the student body,
much less that of "the Stanford
community." My guess is that
Governor Reagan is a great deal
more legitimately able to speak
for his constituency, the people of
the State of California.
I do not feel that the Reagan
administration has "crippled the
University of California and
nearly destroyed the State College
system." What damage has been
done can more likely by charged
to the SDS and the BSU. In
passing, Mr. Hayes accuses
President Hayakawa of San
Francisco State of "heavy-handed
authoritarianism." My personal
feeling is that SF State would
probably have burned down if it
hadn't been for the courageous
efforts of S.I. Hayakawa.
History will determine what
course of action is most effective
in quelling the uprisings of small
groups of extremist students. I
contend that history will show
that peace on campus is more
effectively attained by the
immediate use of lawful force
against those who violate
University and civil regulations.

•Double Standard
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to draw the
attention of the Stanford
community to certain insidious
invasions of civil rights that are
wrongfully being tolerated.
Yesterday's Dail) reported that
AEL demonstrators discovered
documents on Prof. Rambo's desk
linking him with a society
dedicated to electronic warfare. I
ask: what were those
demonstrators doing at Prof.
Rambo's desk?
The fourth amendment to the
U.S. Constitution guarantees "the
right of the people to be secure in
their houses, papers, and effects,
against unreasonable searches and
seizures." Unfortunately, Prof.
Rambo's right to privacy exists
only to the extent he is willing to
demand it, by recourse to the
courts, if necessary. But I'm sure
thai both he and the university
are too afraid of antagonizing the

demonstrators to take any such
action.
Of course, there have been
many instances in the present
sit-in of locked offices being
invaded and private papers
confiscated. The same tactic was
used at Harvard and Columbia.
And Tuesday's Daily reported
that Steve Weissman, addressing
the AEL demonstrators, urged
them not to condemn those who
would take personal or even
classified files, for such files have
been ''important to the
movement."
I condemn such invasions of
privacy for whatever reasons and
urge those who have been
wronged to enforce their rights
through legal channels.
Not long ago many people on
this campus were whining because
marijuana was found in a
student's library locker, and he
got into legal trouble as a result.
Yes, the double standard is
alive and well at Stanford.

Editor, THE DAILY:
To the dissident Foreign
Students:
Yesterday's letter by four
students from Norway requires
some clarification from my side.
1) The International
Association is not only a group of
Foreign Students. The
Constitution clearly states: . . .the
I. A. shall provide for the
representation and association of
Foreign and American students
concerned with international
activities on campus and for all
aspects of these activities (Para.
II).

2) The sit-in is clearly of major
concern to us, since we are
especially concerned with CBW
and military research conducted
against foreign countries and third
world people, which the
statement of support clearly
indicates:
''We the International
Association, composed of Foreign
and American Students feel very
strongly the need, in the present
circumstances, to state our firm
support to you students directly
engaged in struggle with Stanford
on SRI war activities.
As human beings we are hKe
you concerned in the first place
with the issues raised on chemical
and biological warfare,
counter-insurgency and other
military research, mainly directed
against the third world people.
Your fight is our fight as well.
We salute the present struggle of
students against the American war
machine.
Our support will always go to
those students against racism and
imperialism throughout the
world."
3) The resolution was passed by
a clear majority. Since the Policy
Board of the I.A. has the final
deliberative and decision-making
power in all matters of policy, we
exercised this right on a very
crucial issue. Those people outside
should present their viewpoints
directly to the Policy Board or
through the election and
referendum on Political Issues on
May 6th.
