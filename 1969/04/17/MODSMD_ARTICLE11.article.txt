## Congratulations, Engineers 
### Dave Offen 
M embers of the Stanford
engineering community, we must
congratulate ourselves. In the
recent engineering poll we showed
again that it is important to have
stimulating research, irrespective
of how it impresses othersâ€”who
said "oppresses"?
With our understanding of the
physical world we can, and do,
change the face of the earth in the
most imaginative ways possible.
Through our intimate contact
with technological concepts, we
can see the necessity of war. Just
try to imagine how many of us
would be deprived of fascinating
research if it weren't for war.
There is nothing more valuable
to society than an efficiently
programmed researcher. We ail
agree on that. And solving
problems is infinitely more

satisfying than muddling our
minds with the BS and rhetoric of
social issues.
Now that the engineering poll
has come out, we know that we
have a great start; we're on the
road to success. If we can unify
ourselves firmly behind our
convictions, just think of how
much better our education could
be:
First of all, I think we should
work towards abolishing General
Studies requirements. In this way,
we can take up to 180 units of
engineering courses alone, or even
more courses with summer school,
and we won't have to worry about
taking irrelevant classes. Maybe,
after working five or ten years
through legitimate channels, this
dream can become a reality.

Secondly, I think we should
work towards keeping all
non-engineers (with the possible
exception of a few, selected
scientists) out of the engineering
courses and engineering buildings.
It's none of their damn business
what we do with their lives! They
just can't begin to comprehend
the complexity of the issues we
face, and we are much more
practiced in problem-solving and
decision-making, anyway.
So let's talk it up. Let's put our
power to the best use possible, by
involving ourselves in the
fascinating world of nature.
You say I forgot that man is
part of nature?
Oh, ya . . . maybe he is at that.
