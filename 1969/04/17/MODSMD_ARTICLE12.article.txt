## Reason Together On SRI 
### Sidney Slomich 
I came to talk to you on the
fourth of March when you asked,
and I appreciate your carrying
today my personal views and
reactions to the issues being raised
in the Stanford community and to
the Scott Report. Is there,
however, a Stanford community,
or is it incumbent now to invent
one?
American universities
increasingly over the last
generation have been
bureaucratic, insulated and
peer-group ridden. There has not
been among faculties much
passion for inquiry, research and
action befitting a constitutional
democracy on issues like arms
control and disarmament,
pathways to international order,
restoration of the health of the
environment and encouraging
socially responsive attitudes in the
corporate world. Nor has there
been much passion for education
in humanism and democratic
responsibility.
The community comes into
being on those glorious Fall
Saturdays when Cal or UCLA
comes to town for football.
Now that faculty and students
are moving to new levels of social
awareness and responsibility, with
all the questions raised being
admirable, though some of the
methods and "solutions" are not,
a Stanford-SRI separation, should
it occur, could emerge as a
tragicomic event.
It was gratifying on Sunday
last participating with SRI
colleagues in dialogues in the
courtyard of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, to
discover, among the negativism,
profound and constructive
attitudes.
It was also gratifying and
reassuring to meet respect for
SRl's commitment and
accomplishments in important
social areas.
Along with the usual
misconceptions and distortions,
there was a willingness to learn.
Young people want a chance, and
also want to give their elders a
chance.
As for the Scott Report, both
the minority and majority

viewpoints raised isses and
discussed them with expertise and
sensitivity, while "settling" them
with much less. The
recommendations were pompous,
invested with (quite unjustified)
holier-than-thou attitudes and,
were, more importantly, not
responsive to today's crisis in
Academia, the Community and
the Country.
Let us sever relationships, it
said; you are immoral, but give us
cash. Is the Scott Report the
beginning or the end of dialogue?
I came to SRI last year looking
for autonomy, and found it. I
won't work on officially
supported Vietnam studies, but I
am not sure that I or anyone else
has the moral or legal right in a
constitutional and pluralist
society to say that others cannot.
The issues are complex. They

arose over a generation and can't
be settled in a week.
The vacuous wording of Scott
Committee recommendations
threaten independent research and
inquiry relating to socially and
politically relevant, but
controversial issues. Some today
question research on Vietnam
under an amorphous proposed
review relationship; some
tomorrow, when the political
climate may have swung to
opposite extremes, may stigmatize
research on population control or
arms control and disarmament.
The Stanford Community—if
there is one—needs to think in
terms of orderly and sensible
procedures rooted in a political
and ethical tradition going back
more than 3,000 years, not in
visceral moral indignation.
As I see it, it is now up to the

faculty. If ihey choose
non-involvement and pomposity,
I will be among the first of SRI
colleagues with a similar approach
and values to push for separation.
If I might address a word to
the Sit-ins at AEL: Please go
home. You have made some
points, most of them good. I wish
my own Alma Mater's
administration had behaved last
week as sensibly and reasonably as
yours. The abuse Of the
procedures of constitutional
democracy by Lyndon Johnson
and others means neither that he
invented nor owns them. Let us
reason together.
