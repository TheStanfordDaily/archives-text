## Power And A Better World 
### Molly Dougherty 
A number of students do not
support the sit-in, saying "I agree
with the goals but not the
tactics." Besides being the easiest
way to avoid really thinking about
the goals, this statement is usually
not true. For the most part,
people who do not like the tactics
do not like the goals either.
The two are inseparable. Why?
Because behind them both is a
common worldview—a worldview
that says that a few men have too
much power, and that what they
are doing with that power is
immoral. That worldview is
behind the demands, which ask
that the trustees stop using their
power in immoral ways.
That worldview is also behind
the tactics, in two ways. First,

since the system perpetuated by
the trustees and the faculty is
immoral, the educational aspect
of the tactics appeals to the moral
sensitivity of the community.
Secondly, since the trustees have
too much power, the action
aspect of the tactics is a use of
power.
It is this second aspect of the
tactics —the use of
is a real hang-up for a lot of
people. Moral appeals are fine, but
"power" is a dirty word, as are
"coercive tactics" and
"demands."
Why is power such a hang-up?
In the first place, most people do
not admit to themselves how
powerless they are, and if they do
admit it, they see it as an
inevitable condition. Stanford
students are not "most people."
They have been treated well
enough by the system that
powerlessness does not gnaw on
their conscious mind. Why should
it? For them it is not inevitable,
but only temporary.
Means To Power
For them the system is a
ready-made means to eventual
power. They need only to be
patient and to follow the rules of
the system obediently. As Russell

Baker said: "Stand in Harvard
Yard and you suddenly realize
that you are entirely surrounded
by people with a gold-edged
guarantee against losing at
American life." Stand in the
middle of the Stanford Quad and
you realize the same thing.
But the crux of the matter is
that these people do not want
other powerless individuals or
groups to wield power. Since they
themselves are temporarily
powerless, any attempt to wield
power is a threat to them. It is a
threat to that power they
someday hope to exercise.
They are willing to accept the
immense power of men like the
trustees, because that is part of
the status quo. They see the only
alternative to the status quo as the
substitution of one elitist group
for another. Either way they get
left out. And they fear that the
group that takes over may be
worse than the one now in power.
This is a legitimate fear and
should be kept in mind, but the
point is that that is not the only
alternative.
Don't Dream Enough
People who see this as the only
alternative don't dream enough,
don't hope enough, and don't
have enough faith in people. They
believe it is not possible to build a
world of equal opportunity for
creative self-fulfillment. They
believe that gross inequality and
violence to human life and to the
human sprit are inevitable. They
believe that "human nature"
makes it impossible to build a
society better than ours.
Many of us sitting in the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
do believe these things are
possible. We have no absolute
guarantee that such a world will
ever come into being, but we feel
a strong obligation to try to create
it.
