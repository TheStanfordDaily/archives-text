# Allard Lowenstein.. An Implausible Political Hero
## 
### STROBE TALBOTT 
(Ed. Note, the author is a former
editor of the Yale Daily News and lias
followed Congressman Lowenstein's
career for some time.)
AUard K. Lowenstein, who spent two
days this month as the Inter-fraternity
Council's guest-in-residence, is an
implausible sort of political hero. For a
long time he has been distinguished as
much by his boyish, somewhat sloppy
appearance and his madcap lifestyle
as by his rigorous mind and his
remarkable career.
He looks ten years too young to be a
serious figure in national politics and
ten years too old to be on the inside of
student movements. Yet he is a
formidable influence in both places, and
he is getting more formidable all the
'time in the U.S. House of
Representatives as its most energetic
and progressive freshman congressman.
He is probably on a first-name basis
with more people, and certainly more
young people, than anyone else in
Congress-and that in itself is progress,
A year ago A 1 Lowenstein had a far
less promising reputation than he has
today. He was widely known on college
campuses as an almost legendary figure;
he had been turning up in common
rooms and student unions to organize
for numerous causes since the early
fifties when he had been president of
the National Student Association (in its
pre-CIA days) and then head of
Students for Stevenson. He was widely
appreciated among students for his

casual manner and his ability to
combine an articulate advocacy of
idealistic positions with a thorough
understanding of practical politics.
Worked Against Him
But his success with students worked
against him during his many forays into
Democratic Party in-fighting and New
York electoral battles. He was put down
as a minor-leaguer, an aging student
body president, a good high school
debater but a naive professional
politician. The press was sympathetic to
him but condescending; Lowenstein was
billed as a kind of Don Quixote in a
varsity letter sweater, the champion of
more lost causes than any other bright
young man in America.
His detractors began to take him
more seriously about a year ago.
Lowenstein was intimately associated
with the protagonists of the four major
events of last year: he had as much as
anyone to do with mounting the
pressures which dumped Lyndon
Johnson; he was crucial in getting
Eugene McCarthy to run for President;
he was a board member of the SCLC
and a close friend and advisor to Martin
Luther King; he was closer still to
Robert Kennedy.
After last spring's triumph over
Johnson and the subsequent tragedies in
Memphis and Los Angeles, Lowenstein
devoted himself to the plight of
dissident liberal Democrats, who were in
the ambiguous position of being the
party in power yet alienated from their
own leadership. While working hard in

the Coalition for Democratic
Alternatives and later the Coalition for
an Open Convention, Lowenstein was
also running a campaign for Congress in
Nassau County on Long Island as an
underdog and carpetbagger.
Campaign \V on
The coalitions produced neither
democratic alternatives nor an open
convention in Chicago, but they did
enhance Lowenstein's stature among the
men who will probably be running the
party in 1972; and he won his campaign
for Congress.
The philosophy he brought to the
Hill was, "If we're going to do anything,
we've got to start doing everything."
Despite his curious relegation to the
agriculture committee, Lowenstein has
managed to start doing a bit of
everything in the House.
He is working on bills to repeal the
draft and oil depletion allowance, to
reform agricultural subsidies, House
rules, and the loophole-ridden tax
system. His biggest concern is stopping
what he calls the "nightmare of military
spending." Last week he voted against a
supplemental allocation of $76 million
for "maintenance" of military
hardware.
Frustration
He does not so much see Congress as
a new world and a new life as simply an
opportunity to escalate his own
effectiveness. "Whenever I'm
interviewed I'm always asked if I feel
frustrated and stepped on in Congress.
Anyone who thinks I'm frustrated now

doesn't know what I was doing before 1
got to Congress."
One thing Lowenstein did before he
got to Congress was serve as an assistant
dean of men at Stanford in 1961-62.
And that had its frustrations, too.
Lowenstein was put in charge of
Stern Hall. One of his colleagues from
those years recalls that Stern Hall was
the "turkey house, the place where all
the rejects from the fraternity rush and
other undesirables went and sucked
their thumbs." Lowenstein set about to
change this. With the encouragement of
William Craig, then dean of men,
Lowenstein made Stern Hall a center of
intellectual life and social activism when
neither commodity was very fashionable
among Stanford students. He even
persuaded a number of prominent and
widely-respected students who were
disenchanted with the fraternity system
to move out of their Greek houses and
into Stern.
Resignation
In so doing, Lowenstein helped break
the stranglehold which the fraternities
then had over social life at Stanford. He
also made himself a number of bitter
enemies among traditionalists in the
administration, including then-President
Wallace Sterling. After being harassed
and vilified all year, Lowenstein
resigned.
Despite his reputation then as a
flaming renegade, Lowenstein's mode of
operation has always been to work
outside the normal apparatus but not
outside the system. He is certainly not a

revolutionary. His personal political
roots are with New York reform clubs
and liberal white southerners whom he
met at the University of North Carolina
and during the early years of the Civil
Rights movement in Mississippi.
His own heroes are Eleanor
Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Norman
Thomas, and Frank Graham. He finds
his most receptive audience with groups
like the Women's Strike for Peace and
among the more traditional, clean-cut
student leader types.
Limit Of Influence
His influence ends abruptly where
the New Left begins. SDS-founder Tom
Hayden denounced him during the
Chicago convention as "a professional
CIA-oriented politician," and Ramparts
ran a story last summer by Paul Cowan
arguing that "the McCarthys and the
Lowensteins are the most effective
champions in the country of the order
that the upper-middle-class Americans
who support themwantto maintain."
However, the fact remains that
Lowenstein probably has more contacts
than anyone between the political
underground in this country and the
corridors of power. He has spent time in
both places.
Lowenstein's life changes and yet it
doesn't change. Being a congressman
with a young wife, a baby boy, and
another baby on the way is certainly a
change from the days when his only
constituents were the students who
turned up at a rally or a midnight

organization meeting to hear him speak.
But in other ways Lowenstein's life is
very much the same as it has always
been. He was obviously in his element
when he breezed into Phi Delt Tuesday
night or Grove House Wed night,
unbuttoned his shirt and took off his
shoes, and led a discussion which was
informal, yet tight, coherent and close
to the issues. A champion wrestler in
college, he still looks for a work-out on
the mat whenever he visits a college
campus. He still hardly ever sleeps. And
he still flies about the country and the
world like a messianic whirling dervish.
"When there are so many things to
do, you're always limited by the basic
problem of where you're physically at.
Should I go to Vietnam where we really
need a Congressional committee?
Should I go to Fort Jackson where ten
kids are undergoing something like
Presidio? Should I go to the Middle
East? Should I go back to the district?
Or should I go to Stanford to speak?"
The problem of "where you're
physically at" is less of a limitation for
Lowenstein than it is for other men. He
manages somehow to get to all these
places and to do all these things,
including coming to Stanford to speak.'
And he hasn't yet succumbed to
laryngitis or fatigue. In fact, A 1
Lowenstein is looking well and going
strong. He could well be beginning the
most intensive and effective period of
an already extraordinary career.

AUard K. Lowenstein, who spent two
days this month as the Inter-fraternity
Council's guest-in-residence, is an
implausible sort of political hero. For a
long time he has been distinguished as
much by his boyish, somewhat sloppy
appearance and his madcap lifestyle
as by his rigorous mind and his
remarkable career.
He looks ten years too young to be a
serious figure in national politics and
ten years too old to be on the inside of
student movements. Yet he is a
formidable influence in both places, and
he is getting more formidable all the
'time in the U.S. House of
Representatives as its most energetic
and progressive freshman congressman.
He is probably on a first-name basis
with more people, and certainly more
young people, than anyone else in
Congress-and that in itself is progress,
A year ago A 1 Lowenstein had a far
less promising reputation than he has
today. He was widely known on college
campuses as an almost legendary figure;
he had been turning up in common
rooms and student unions to organize
for numerous causes since the early
fifties when he had been president of
the National Student Association (in its
pre-CIA days) and then head of
Students for Stevenson. He was widely
appreciated among students for his

casual manner and his ability to
combine an articulate advocacy of
idealistic positions with a thorough
understanding of practical politics.
Worked Against Him
But his success with students worked
against him during his many forays into
Democratic Party in-fighting and New
York electoral battles. He was put down
as a minor-leaguer, an aging student
body president, a good high school
debater but a naive professional
politician. The press was sympathetic to
him but condescending; Lowenstein was
billed as a kind of Don Quixote in a
varsity letter sweater, the champion of
more lost causes than any other bright
young man in America.
His detractors began to take him
more seriously about a year ago.
Lowenstein was intimately associated
with the protagonists of the four major
events of last year: he had as much as
anyone to do with mounting the
pressures which dumped Lyndon
Johnson; he was crucial in getting
Eugene McCarthy to run for President;
he was a board member of the SCLC
and a close friend and advisor to Martin
Luther King; he was closer still to
Robert Kennedy.
After last spring's triumph over
Johnson and the subsequent tragedies in
Memphis and Los Angeles, Lowenstein
devoted himself to the plight of
dissident liberal Democrats, who were in
the ambiguous position of being the
party in power yet alienated from their
own leadership. While working hard in

the Coalition for Democratic
Alternatives and later the Coalition for
an Open Convention, Lowenstein was
also running a campaign for Congress in
Nassau County on Long Island as an
underdog and carpetbagger.
Campaign \V on
The coalitions produced neither
democratic alternatives nor an open
convention in Chicago, but they did
enhance Lowenstein's stature among the
men who will probably be running the
party in 1972; and he won his campaign
for Congress.
The philosophy he brought to the
Hill was, "If we're going to do anything,
we've got to start doing everything."
Despite his curious relegation to the
agriculture committee, Lowenstein has
managed to start doing a bit of
everything in the House.
He is working on bills to repeal the
draft and oil depletion allowance, to
reform agricultural subsidies, House
rules, and the loophole-ridden tax
system. His biggest concern is stopping
what he calls the "nightmare of military
spending." Last week he voted against a
supplemental allocation of $76 million
for "maintenance" of military
hardware.
Frustration
He does not so much see Congress as
a new world and a new life as simply an
opportunity to escalate his own
effectiveness. "Whenever I'm
interviewed I'm always asked if I feel
frustrated and stepped on in Congress.
Anyone who thinks I'm frustrated now

doesn't know what I was doing before 1
got to Congress."
One thing Lowenstein did before he
got to Congress was serve as an assistant
dean of men at Stanford in 1961-62.
And that had its frustrations, too.
Lowenstein was put in charge of
Stern Hall. One of his colleagues from
those years recalls that Stern Hall was
the "turkey house, the place where all
the rejects from the fraternity rush and
other undesirables went and sucked
their thumbs." Lowenstein set about to
change this. With the encouragement of
William Craig, then dean of men,
Lowenstein made Stern Hall a center of
intellectual life and social activism when
neither commodity was very fashionable
among Stanford students. He even
persuaded a number of prominent and
widely-respected students who were
disenchanted with the fraternity system
to move out of their Greek houses and
into Stern.
Resignation
In so doing, Lowenstein helped break
the stranglehold which the fraternities
then had over social life at Stanford. He
also made himself a number of bitter
enemies among traditionalists in the
administration, including then-President
Wallace Sterling. After being harassed
and vilified all year, Lowenstein
resigned.
Despite his reputation then as a
flaming renegade, Lowenstein's mode of
operation has always been to work
outside the normal apparatus but not
outside the system. He is certainly not a

revolutionary. His personal political
roots are with New York reform clubs
and liberal white southerners whom he
met at the University of North Carolina
and during the early years of the Civil
Rights movement in Mississippi.
His own heroes are Eleanor
Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Norman
Thomas, and Frank Graham. He finds
his most receptive audience with groups
like the Women's Strike for Peace and
among the more traditional, clean-cut
student leader types.
Limit Of Influence
His influence ends abruptly where
the New Left begins. SDS-founder Tom
Hayden denounced him during the
Chicago convention as "a professional
CIA-oriented politician," and Ramparts
ran a story last summer by Paul Cowan
arguing that "the McCarthys and the
Lowensteins are the most effective
champions in the country of the order
that the upper-middle-class Americans
who support themwantto maintain."
However, the fact remains that
Lowenstein probably has more contacts
than anyone between the political
underground in this country and the
corridors of power. He has spent time in
both places.
Lowenstein's life changes and yet it
doesn't change. Being a congressman
with a young wife, a baby boy, and
another baby on the way is certainly a
change from the days when his only
constituents were the students who
turned up at a rally or a midnight

organization meeting to hear him speak.
But in other ways Lowenstein's life is
very much the same as it has always
been. He was obviously in his element
when he breezed into Phi Delt Tuesday
night or Grove House Wed night,
unbuttoned his shirt and took off his
shoes, and led a discussion which was
informal, yet tight, coherent and close
to the issues. A champion wrestler in
college, he still looks for a work-out on
the mat whenever he visits a college
campus. He still hardly ever sleeps. And
he still flies about the country and the
world like a messianic whirling dervish.
"When there are so many things to

underground in this country and the
corridors of power. He has spent time in
both places.
Lowenstein's life changes and yet it
doesn't change. Being a congressman
with a young wife, a baby boy, and
another baby on the way is certainly a
change from the days when his only
constituents were the students who
turned up at a rally or a midnight

organization meeting to hear him speak.
But in other ways Lowenstein's life is
very much the same as it has always
been. He was obviously in his element
when he breezed into Phi Delt Tuesday
night or Grove House Wed night,
unbuttoned his shirt and took off his
shoes, and led a discussion which was
informal, yet tight, coherent and close
to the issues. A champion wrestler in
college, he still looks for a work-out on
the mat whenever he visits a college
campus. He still hardly ever sleeps. And
he still flies about the country and the
world like a messianic whirling dervish.
"When there are so many things to
do, you're always limited by the basic
problem of where you're physically at.
Should I go to Vietnam where we really
need a Congressional committee?
Should I go to Fort Jackson where ten
kids are undergoing something like
Presidio? Should I go to the Middle
East? Should I go back to the district?
Or should I go to Stanford to speak?"
The problem of "where you're
physically at" is less of a limitation for
Lowenstein than it is for other men. He
manages somehow to get to all these
places and to do all these things,
including coming to Stanford to speak.'
And he hasn't yet succumbed to
laryngitis or fatigue. In fact, A 1
Lowenstein is looking well and going
strong. He could well be beginning the
most intensive and effective period of
an already extraordinary career.

AUard K. Lowenstein, who spent two
days this month as the Inter-fraternity
Council's guest-in-residence, is an
implausible sort of political hero. For a
long time he has been distinguished as
much by his boyish, somewhat sloppy
appearance and his madcap lifestyle
as by his rigorous mind and his
remarkable career.
He looks ten years too young to be a
serious figure in national politics and
ten years too old to be on the inside of
student movements. Yet he is a
formidable influence in both places, and
he is getting more formidable all the
'time in the U.S. House of
Representatives as its most energetic
and progressive freshman congressman.
He is probably on a first-name basis
with more people, and certainly more
young people, than anyone else in
Congress-and that in itself is progress,
A year ago A 1 Lowenstein had a far
less promising reputation than he has
today. He was widely known on college
campuses as an almost legendary figure;
he had been turning up in common
rooms and student unions to organize
for numerous causes since the early
fifties when he had been president of
the National Student Association (in its
pre-CIA days) and then head of
Students for Stevenson. He was widely
appreciated among students for his

casual manner and his ability to
combine an articulate advocacy of
idealistic positions with a thorough
understanding of practical politics.
Worked Against Him
But his success with students worked
against him during his many forays into
Democratic Party in-fighting and New
York electoral battles. He was put down
as a minor-leaguer, an aging student
body president, a good high school
debater but a naive professional
politician. The press was sympathetic to
him but condescending; Lowenstein was
billed as a kind of Don Quixote in a
varsity letter sweater, the champion of
more lost causes than any other bright
young man in America.
His detractors began to take him
more seriously about a year ago.
Lowenstein was intimately associated
with the protagonists of the four major
events of last year: he had as much as
anyone to do with mounting the
pressures which dumped Lyndon
Johnson; he was crucial in getting
Eugene McCarthy to run for President;
he was a board member of the SCLC
and a close friend and advisor to Martin
Luther King; he was closer still to
Robert Kennedy.
After last spring's triumph over
Johnson and the subsequent tragedies in
Memphis and Los Angeles, Lowenstein
devoted himself to the plight of
dissident liberal Democrats, who were in
the ambiguous position of being the
party in power yet alienated from their
own leadership. While working hard in

the Coalition for Democratic
Alternatives and later the Coalition for
an Open Convention, Lowenstein was
also running a campaign for Congress in
Nassau County on Long Island as an
underdog and carpetbagger.
Campaign \V on
The coalitions produced neither
democratic alternatives nor an open
convention in Chicago, but they did
enhance Lowenstein's stature among the
men who will probably be running the
party in 1972; and he won his campaign
for Congress.
The philosophy he brought to the
Hill was, "If we're going to do anything,
we've got to start doing everything."
Despite his curious relegation to the
agriculture committee, Lowenstein has
managed to start doing a bit of
everything in the House.
He is working on bills to repeal the
draft and oil depletion allowance, to
reform agricultural subsidies, House
rules, and the loophole-ridden tax
system. His biggest concern is stopping
what he calls the "nightmare of military
spending." Last week he voted against a
supplemental allocation of $76 million
for "maintenance" of military
hardware.
Frustration
He does not so much see Congress as
a new world and a new life as simply an
opportunity to escalate his own
effectiveness. "Whenever I'm
interviewed I'm always asked if I feel
frustrated and stepped on in Congress.
Anyone who thinks I'm frustrated now

doesn't know what I was doing before 1
got to Congress."
One thing Lowenstein did before he
got to Congress was serve as an assistant
dean of men at Stanford in 1961-62.
And that had its frustrations, too.
Lowenstein was put in charge of
Stern Hall. One of his colleagues from
those years recalls that Stern Hall was
the "turkey house, the place where all
the rejects from the fraternity rush and
other undesirables went and sucked
their thumbs." Lowenstein set about to
change this. With the encouragement of
William Craig, then dean of men,
Lowenstein made Stern Hall a center of
intellectual life and social activism when
neither commodity was very fashionable
among Stanford students. He even
persuaded a number of prominent and
widely-respected students who were
disenchanted with the fraternity system
to move out of their Greek houses and
into Stern.
Resignation
In so doing, Lowenstein helped break
the stranglehold which the fraternities
then had over social life at Stanford. He
also made himself a number of bitter
enemies among traditionalists in the
administration, including then-President
Wallace Sterling. After being harassed
and vilified all year, Lowenstein
resigned.
Despite his reputation then as a
flaming renegade, Lowenstein's mode of
operation has always been to work
outside the normal apparatus but not
outside the system. He is certainly not a

revolutionary. His personal political
roots are with New York reform clubs
and liberal white southerners whom he
met at the University of North Carolina
and during the early years of the Civil
Rights movement in Mississippi.
His own heroes are Eleanor
Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Norman
Thomas, and Frank Graham. He finds
his most receptive audience with groups
like the Women's Strike for Peace and
among the more traditional, clean-cut
student leader types.
Limit Of Influence
His influence ends abruptly where
the New Left begins. SDS-founder Tom
Hayden denounced him during the
Chicago convention as "a professional
CIA-oriented politician," and Ramparts
ran a story last summer by Paul Cowan
arguing that "the McCarthys and the
Lowensteins are the most effective
champions in the country of the order
that the upper-middle-class Americans
who support themwantto maintain."
However, the fact remains that
Lowenstein probably has more contacts
than anyone between the political
underground in this country and the
corridors of power. He has spent time in
both places.
Lowenstein's life changes and yet it

and liberal white southerners whom he
met at the University of North Carolina
and during the early years of the Civil
Rights movement in Mississippi.
His own heroes are Eleanor
Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Norman
Thomas, and Frank Graham. He finds
his most receptive audience with groups
like the Women's Strike for Peace and
among the more traditional, clean-cut
student leader types.
Limit Of Influence
His influence ends abruptly where
the New Left begins. SDS-founder Tom
Hayden denounced him during the
Chicago convention as "a professional
CIA-oriented politician," and Ramparts
ran a story last summer by Paul Cowan
arguing that "the McCarthys and the
Lowensteins are the most effective
champions in the country of the order
that the upper-middle-class Americans
who support themwantto maintain."
However, the fact remains that
Lowenstein probably has more contacts
than anyone between the political
underground in this country and the
corridors of power. He has spent time in
both places.
Lowenstein's life changes and yet it
doesn't change. Being a congressman
with a young wife, a baby boy, and
another baby on the way is certainly a
change from the days when his only
constituents were the students who
turned up at a rally or a midnight

organization meeting to hear him speak.
But in other ways Lowenstein's life is
very much the same as it has always
been. He was obviously in his element
when he breezed into Phi Delt Tuesday
night or Grove House Wed night,
unbuttoned his shirt and took off his
shoes, and led a discussion which was
informal, yet tight, coherent and close
to the issues. A champion wrestler in
college, he still looks for a work-out on
the mat whenever he visits a college
campus. He still hardly ever sleeps. And
he still flies about the country and the
world like a messianic whirling dervish.
"When there are so many things to
do, you're always limited by the basic
problem of where you're physically at.
Should I go to Vietnam where we really
need a Congressional committee?
Should I go to Fort Jackson where ten
kids are undergoing something like
Presidio? Should I go to the Middle
East? Should I go back to the district?
Or should I go to Stanford to speak?"
The problem of "where you're
physically at" is less of a limitation for
Lowenstein than it is for other men. He
manages somehow to get to all these
places and to do all these things,
including coming to Stanford to speak.'
And he hasn't yet succumbed to
laryngitis or fatigue. In fact, A 1
Lowenstein is looking well and going
strong. He could well be beginning the
most intensive and effective period of
an already extraordinary career.

AUard K. Lowenstein, who spent two
days this month as the Inter-fraternity
Council's guest-in-residence, is an
implausible sort of political hero. For a
long time he has been distinguished as
much by his boyish, somewhat sloppy
appearance and his madcap lifestyle
as by his rigorous mind and his
remarkable career.
He looks ten years too young to be a
serious figure in national politics and
ten years too old to be on the inside of
student movements. Yet he is a
formidable influence in both places, and
he is getting more formidable all the
'time in the U.S. House of
Representatives as its most energetic
and progressive freshman congressman.
He is probably on a first-name basis
with more people, and certainly more
young people, than anyone else in
Congress-and that in itself is progress,
A year ago A 1 Lowenstein had a far
less promising reputation than he has
today. He was widely known on college
campuses as an almost legendary figure;
he had been turning up in common
rooms and student unions to organize
for numerous causes since the early
fifties when he had been president of
the National Student Association (in its
pre-CIA days) and then head of
Students for Stevenson. He was widely
appreciated among students for his

casual manner and his ability to
combine an articulate advocacy of
idealistic positions with a thorough
understanding of practical politics.
Worked Against Him
But his success with students worked
against him during his many forays into
Democratic Party in-fighting and New
York electoral battles. He was put down
as a minor-leaguer, an aging student
body president, a good high school
debater but a naive professional
politician. The press was sympathetic to
him but condescending; Lowenstein was
billed as a kind of Don Quixote in a
varsity letter sweater, the champion of
more lost causes than any other bright
young man in America.
His detractors began to take him
more seriously about a year ago.
Lowenstein was intimately associated
with the protagonists of the four major
events of last year: he had as much as
anyone to do with mounting the
pressures which dumped Lyndon
Johnson; he was crucial in getting
Eugene McCarthy to run for President;
he was a board member of the SCLC
and a close friend and advisor to Martin
Luther King; he was closer still to
Robert Kennedy.
After last spring's triumph over
Johnson and the subsequent tragedies in
Memphis and Los Angeles, Lowenstein
devoted himself to the plight of
dissident liberal Democrats, who were in
the ambiguous position of being the
party in power yet alienated from their
own leadership. While working hard in

the Coalition for Democratic
Alternatives and later the Coalition for
an Open Convention, Lowenstein was
also running a campaign for Congress in
Nassau County on Long Island as an
underdog and carpetbagger.
Campaign \V on
The coalitions produced neither
democratic alternatives nor an open
convention in Chicago, but they did
enhance Lowenstein's stature among the
men who will probably be running the
party in 1972; and he won his campaign
for Congress.
The philosophy he brought to the
Hill was, "If we're going to do anything,
we've got to start doing everything."
Despite his curious relegation to the
agriculture committee, Lowenstein has
managed to start doing a bit of
everything in the House.
He is working on bills to repeal the
draft and oil depletion allowance, to
reform agricultural subsidies, House
rules, and the loophole-ridden tax
system. His biggest concern is stopping
what he calls the "nightmare of military
spending." Last week he voted against a
supplemental allocation of $76 million
for "maintenance" of military
hardware.
Frustration
He does not so much see Congress as
a new world and a new life as simply an
opportunity to escalate his own
effectiveness. "Whenever I'm
interviewed I'm always asked if I feel
frustrated and stepped on in Congress.
Anyone who thinks I'm frustrated now

doesn't know what I was doing before 1
got to Congress."
One thing Lowenstein did before he
got to Congress was serve as an assistant
dean of men at Stanford in 1961-62.
And that had its frustrations, too.
Lowenstein was put in charge of
Stern Hall. One of his colleagues from
those years recalls that Stern Hall was
the "turkey house, the place where all
the rejects from the fraternity rush and
other undesirables went and sucked
their thumbs." Lowenstein set about to
change this. With the encouragement of
William Craig, then dean of men,
Lowenstein made Stern Hall a center of
intellectual life and social activism when
neither commodity was very fashionable
among Stanford students. He even
persuaded a number of prominent and
widely-respected students who were
disenchanted with the fraternity system
to move out of their Greek houses and
into Stern.
Resignation
In so doing, Lowenstein helped break
the stranglehold which the fraternities
then had over social life at Stanford. He
also made himself a number of bitter
enemies among traditionalists in the
administration, including then-President
Wallace Sterling. After being harassed
and vilified all year, Lowenstein
resigned.
Despite his reputation then as a
flaming renegade, Lowenstein's mode of
operation has always been to work
outside the normal apparatus but not
outside the system. He is certainly not a

revolutionary. His personal political
roots are with New York reform clubs
and liberal white southerners whom he
met at the University of North Carolina
and during the early years of the Civil
Rights movement in Mississippi.
His own heroes are Eleanor
Roosevelt, Adlai Stevenson, Norman
Thomas, and Frank Graham. He finds
