# Anderson Has Misgivings
## SRI Accepts CBW Ruling 
### KIM THORBURN 
"We will cooperate fully with
the Trustees' request that we
rpake no new contracts lor
research for chemical and
biological warfare," according to
Charles Anderson, President of
SRI.
"However, I want to emphasize
Jiat work in CBW represents only
small number of our contracts,"
e said. "Less than one tenth of
One percent of our work is
Involved with CBW. That means
One and one half men per year are
used in this research.
' "Our work in CBW is not
lengthy or offensive," he
continued. "None of it is
classified.
"We have made it clear to our

clients that our halt in CBW
research is only temporary and
not a change in SRI policy. Our
present policy is that we will,
through research programs, serve
the national security interests and
that can only be changed by the
Board of Directors," said
Anderson.
In a letter to the employees of
the Institute about the
moratorium in CBW contracts,
Anderson stated, "I recognize that
this action may be disappointing
to some who have been pursuing
professional programs in the
chemical-biological fields."
Anderson refused to say what
reaction at SRI would be if the
Trustees decide to sever ties or to
bring the Institute under closer

control by the University. "It
would be irresponsible for me to
speak for all our employees," he
said.
"There are some misgivings
among our professional staff and
the organizations served by us as
to the degree of possible control
by a group that isn't directly
responsible for our operations.
Many of our researchers are
concerned about their freedom to
carry out their professional
activities," he added.
There is doubt among SRI
employees that the majority of
the members of the University are
interested enough in the
institute's operations to warrant
closer control. Homer Metters,
Public Relations officer, said that
only sixteen students came to the
discussions held at SRI last fall.
One hundred twenty SRI staff
members volunteered to explain
the organization to interested
students.
Anderson explained that a poll
would be taken among SRI
employees to solicit their
reactions to the committee's
report which rame out on April
15. "The Trustees have assured us
that no decisions will be made
without first consulting us," he
said.

Coalition demand that all
classified contracts be made
public, Anderson stated,
"Discontinuation of classified
research would wipe out SKI as an
organization that supports
national security.
"There is some confusion
about the meaning of classified
research," he continued. "It
merely means information not
accessible to the public; it doesn't
denote something undesirable.
For example, much research done
by Research and Development of
Foremost Dairies isn't given away.
"Certain information can't be
made public because if it became
known to other nations, it would
represent a threat to our national
interests."
"There is no counterinsurgency
program by that name here at
SRI," Anderson continued.
"That's merely an obscure
categorization." This constitutes a
difficulty concerning one of the
Coalition's demands.
"If they want us to stop
military research in Southeast
Asia concerning how radio waves
in a tropical atmosphere or the
establishment of a computer
center for the Thai government,
