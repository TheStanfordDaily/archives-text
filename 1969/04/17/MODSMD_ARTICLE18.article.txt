# Stanford Solicited Gifts 'Preserve American Way'
## 
### CLAIRE DARLEY 
The picture of Stanford on
which alumni and other donors
base their contributions has to be
neatly cropped and touched-up.
"We usually precondition
people with pamphlets," explains
Allan Harris, National Chairman
of Stanford's Annual Giving
Personal Solicitation, "they stress
what good things have been done
at Stanford." Harris mentioned
heart transplants, student and
faculty honors, and outstanding
athletic records.
"Sometimes we get the
response," relates Harris," 'I don't
want to give—they are tearing the
place apart: We try to explain that
there are still good reasons to give.
Some of the reasons I feel giving
to Stanford is a good investment
is that it preserves the American
way of life. In spite of all the bad
things, it is still a pretty good
society we live in. This has been
accomplished by energetic and
educated people.
"It is not just a flag waving
picture. The men who will lick
cancer are going to be
educated ... You get a return on
your investment when you give to
Stanford."

procurement. The most publicized
issues like ROTC, SDS, the
Trustees, and the sit-in are the
subject of most of the mail.
"Naturally we are more
conscious of alumni opinions than
some departments," commented
Pearson. "This is not new by any
means. Our course, however, is
not just determined by what we
think will get the most in gift
money."
''Of course we avoid
antagonizing people," explains
Harris. "You never sell anything
to anybody who is mad at you. If
confronted, I acknowledge the
person's point of view. He usually
hasn't had the benefit of both
sides of the story.
"A person's opinions can often
be overcome if the volunteer has a
good sound background of
information so he can tell it like it
is. For most problems, there is a
reasonable, rational explanation
that will ultimately appeal. We try
and get across the good to them.
If you look at the net good, it's
way on the plus side."
"We've got a great product to
sell—Stanford—but we must
compete with other institutions in
gift solicitation," Harris
explained.
In response to the tremendous
competition, a nationwide
network of volunteer workers
exists to solicit money for
Stanford. Last year, private gifts
supplied 22% of Stanford's
income,-second only to the
contribution through student
tuition and fees.

In the last five years, the
money collected from gifts,
donations, endowments, and
bequests totaled $135.2 million.
During this time period,
foundations supplied $45.2
million, bequests $39.8 million,
living individuals $32.4 million,
and corporations $17.8 million.
A fund-raising staff of 28
headed by the General Secretary,
Pearson, is responsible for gift
procurement. According to Harris,
a Palo Alto manufacturers'
representative, "The fund raising
must be done by volunteers, but
the General Secretary's office
does the paper work. They staff
the volunteer organization and
with the help of computers
provide us with names and
addresses, and crank out statistics
to show how well we are doing."
The Stanford Annual Fund, a
campaign of soliciting from
alumni, reached an all-time high
last year of $1,906,000. About
1,000 volunteers solicited
80-90,000 alumni.
According to Pearson, the
decision whether to meet with a
potential donor is based on the
amount it is estimated the person
will give and on geographic
distribution. "Those expected to
give $1,000 or more are always
contacted personally."
Harris heads a steering
committee consisting of eight
national vice-chairmen. These
vice-chairmen recruit regional
chairmen who recruit captains
who in turn recruit workers.
Workers are usually asked to
contact five other alumni.

Allan Harris, National Chairman

"Sometimes we get the

Some of the reasons I feel giving

is that it preserves the American

"Naturally we are more
conscious of alumni opinions than
some departments," commented
Pearson. "This is not new by any
means. Our course, however, is
not just determined by what we
think will get the most in gift
money."
''Of course we avoid
antagonizing people," explains
Harris. "You never sell anything
to anybody who is mad at you. If
confronted, I acknowledge the
person's point of view. He usually
hasn't had the benefit of both
sides of the story.
"A person's opinions can often
be overcome if the volunteer has a
good sound background of
information so he can tell it like it
is. For most problems, there is a
reasonable, rational explanation
that will ultimately appeal. We try
and get across the good to them.
If you look at the net good, it's
way on the plus side."
"We've got a great product to
sell—Stanford—but we must
compete with other institutions in
gift solicitation," Harris
explained.
In response to the tremendous
competition, a nationwide
network of volunteer workers
exists to solicit money for
Stanford. Last year, private gifts
supplied 22% of Stanford's
income,-second only to the
contribution through student
tuition and fees.

In the last five years, the
money collected from gifts,
donations, endowments, and
bequests totaled $135.2 million.
During this time period,
foundations supplied $45.2
million, bequests $39.8 million,
living individuals $32.4 million,
and corporations $17.8 million.
A fund-raising staff of 28
headed by the General Secretary,
Pearson, is responsible for gift
procurement. According to Harris,
a Palo Alto manufacturers'
representative, "The fund raising
must be done by volunteers, but
the General Secretary's office
does the paper work. They staff
the volunteer organization and
with the help of computers
provide us with names and
addresses, and crank out statistics
to show how well we are doing."
The Stanford Annual Fund, a
campaign of soliciting from
alumni, reached an all-time high
last year of $1,906,000. About
1,000 volunteers solicited
80-90,000 alumni.
According to Pearson, the
decision whether to meet with a
potential donor is based on the
amount it is estimated the person
will give and on geographic
distribution. "Those expected to
give $1,000 or more are always
contacted personally."
