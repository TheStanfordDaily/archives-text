week. "There is city defense and
hard-point defense."
The first refers to the original
Sentinel system which was
lesigned to protect major cities
rom nuclear attack and the latter
0 the "Modified Sentinel" system
>eing reviewed now, which in its
irst phase would protect our
ctual missile minutemen sites,
lowever, later phases would cover
■omber bases on the coasts also.
"The City Defense System
1 principle tries to stop all
acorn ing missiles," explained
anofsky. "The difficulty is that
lis system accelerates the arms
ice. It would cause the Soviet
Union serious concern about its
ability to deter us from the first
strike against them. It is
self-defeating and provocative and
would hinder any negotiations we
have with the Russians."
"In any case," Panofsky
concluded, "the Russians can beat
it with less effort than it takes us
to build it by increasing their
offensive forces correspondingly."
"On principle, I have no
objection to eventually defending
hard missile sites," Panofsky said,
referring to the Modified System.
"If the Russians attacked us first,
it would protect our ability to
come back at them. But there is
no urgency for putting in such a
defense system now. However, if
we were tempted to shoot first,
defending empty holes would
make no difference."
In respect to Defense Secretary
Melvin R. Laird's argument that
the USSR was building up missiles
to achieve a first strike capability
against the US, Panofsky said that
"Laird was trying to make up a
big spectre of the Russian threat. I

believe personally that he greatly
overstated that case. He has no
way to measure the 'intent' of the
Soviets, despite his testimony.
"I have very strong objections
to the actual technical concept of
the execution of the Modified
Sentinel," Panofsky went on.
"When the plans were changed,
they didn't change the missiles
themselves. They're using the
same old stuff.
"Secondly, the Administration
does not plan to put ABM only
around missile sites but have some
which are close to cities. It belies
the intent. The stated change
makes a certain amount of sense
but what is actually being done is
very poor.
"Additional objectives .of the
Modified Sentinel System are
protection against accidental
attack and protection against the
emergent Chinese nuclear threat."
Panofsky said that the Modified
Sentinel has some limited value in
providing protection against
accident; "but the chance of such
an accident occurring is in itself
directly related to the level of
armaments and the degree of
tension in the world."
As for the Chinese, Panofsky
holds that "they are not a threat
now. All the ABM would do, in
any case, is extend the time over
which the US would have a first
strike potential against China."
"It would be less provocative
to the Soviet Union to defend the
force we have rather than to
increase it," Panofsky concluded.
"Such a defense should be
efficiently designed for this
purpose and this purpose only."

Melvin R. Laird's argument that
the USSR was building up missiles
to achieve a first strike capability
against the US, Panofsky said that
"Laird was trying to make up a
big spectre of the Russian threat. I

believe personally that he greatly
overstated that case. He has no
way to measure the 'intent' of the
Soviets, despite his testimony.
"I have very strong objections
to the actual technical concept of
the execution of the Modified
Sentinel," Panofsky went on.
"When the plans were changed,
they didn't change the missiles
themselves. They're using the
same old stuff.
"Secondly, the Administration
does not plan to put ABM only
around missile sites but have some
which are close to cities. It belies
the intent. The stated change
makes a certain amount of sense
but what is actually being done is
very poor.
"Additional objectives .of the
Modified Sentinel System are
protection against accidental
attack and protection against the
emergent Chinese nuclear threat."
Panofsky said that the Modified
Sentinel has some limited value in
providing protection against
accident; "but the chance of such
an accident occurring is in itself
directly related to the level of
armaments and the degree of
tension in the world."
As for the Chinese, Panofsky
holds that "they are not a threat
now. All the ABM would do, in
any case, is extend the time over
which the US would have a first
strike potential against China."
"It would be less provocative
to the Soviet Union to defend the
force we have rather than to
increase it," Panofsky concluded.
"Such a defense should be
efficiently designed for this
purpose and this purpose only."

"The City Defense System

anofsky. "The difficulty is that

Union serious concern about its
ability to deter us from the first
strike against them. It is
self-defeating and provocative and
would hinder any negotiations we
have with the Russians."
"In any case," Panofsky
concluded, "the Russians can beat
it with less effort than it takes us
to build it by increasing their
offensive forces correspondingly."
"On principle, I have no
objection to eventually defending
hard missile sites," Panofsky said,
referring to the Modified System.
"If the Russians attacked us first,
it would protect our ability to
come back at them. But there is
no urgency for putting in such a
defense system now. However, if
we were tempted to shoot first,
defending empty holes would
make no difference."
