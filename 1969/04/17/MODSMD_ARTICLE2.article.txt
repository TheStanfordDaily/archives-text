# Occupation Continues
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) sit-in entered its second week last
night in a cresendo of activity, including
the following major developments:
• ASSU President Denis Hayes called
a special, unprecedented meeting of the
entire Stanford student body for Friday
at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
• University President Kenneth Pitzer
released a statement at 1:30 a.m.
strongly condemning the sit-in. (The full
text appears on Page 1 of The Daily.)
• In a large and tense meeting at AEL
last night, the demonstrators
overwhelmingly defeated a motion to
escalate the sit-in by occupying the new
space sciences building. The April 3
Coalition will hold a noon rally in White
Plaza today. Students continue to
occupy AEL.
• The Student Education Council
(SEC) requested that its reguiarly
scheduled meeting with the faculty
senate this afternoon be cancelled and
that senate meet alone to discuss
research policies at Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute, rather than
the SES items on the agenda. Senate
Chairman Leneord Schiff said last night
that the senate would not meet alone.
• In a flurry of activity in
mid-afternoon yesterday, sit-inners
made brief forays to SRI and Encina
Hall to protest failure to circulate the
minority report of the SRI committee
to the employees at SRI.
• The April 3 Coalition
overwhelmingly adopted a message to
the Stanford community declaring (1)
that its own guidelines on research
policy will be implemented by the
Coalition, including consideration of
allowing certain research to resume at
AEL, (2) that the AEL printing facilities
have not been damaged and have
provided a means of helping the
community understand the issues of

military research on campus, (3) that
the faculty senate action on Tuesday
evening was "token," and that the
faculty must "pledge NOW" that
Stanford will do away with questionable
research, and (4) that the Coalition
repeats its intention not to open any
classified files in AEL. (Full text
appears below.)
Pitzer Blasts Demonstration
Pitzer, in his statement, comments,
"In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to
teach."
He further remarks, "I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by the
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituences have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall."
The statement begins by
energetically condemning the failure of
demonstrators to give their names to
faculty and staff members to begin
hearings by the Stanford Judicial
Council. Pitzer says, "One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked.
"Let nobody think that his own
moral principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
learning in this and all other universities
is founded."
Classified Material
The president notes that classified
material in AEL is threatened by the
presence of the demonstrators and that
the University does not have final
control over policing by federal
authorities. He states, "Should the
federal government find it necessary to
actively take over this responsibility,
clearly the community will have lost, at
least in part, control over our own
affairs."
In announcing plans for the student
body meeting on Friday, Hayes states
that the questionnaire on SRI presently
being mailed to every student and
faculty member necessitates a thorough
knowledge of the issues at stake. He
says,"It is therefore imperative that
each member of the Stanford
community have an opportunity to gain
a thorough understanding of the issues
before casting a ballot.
"To help achieve this end I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112 of the Constitution of
the Associated Students)."
Hayes further states, "This
meeting is open to all members of
the Stanford community. I hope
that faculty, administration, and
employees —as well as
students—will find it possible to
attend."
Hayes has not yet prepared a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Specific proposals should be left
in his mail box in the ASSU office
in Tresidder Union by 3:30 p.m.
today.
Hayes commented last night
that he was not sure the sit-in
would be discussed at the
meeting.
During a five hour meeting at
AEL last night, more than 400
students discussed and voted on
questions of further tactics.
Numerous proposals were
presented, some calling for
escalation by occupying the space
sciences building, and holding a
one day strike. Other proposals
suggested leaving AEL and ending
the sit-in.
Members of the Coalition
charged yesterday that the
University had witheld the full
text of the SRI committee report
from the employees at SRI. The
entire text of the report was
printed by multilith process over
the weekend, but the
Cleaver-Bauer report was not
circulated at SRI until late
yesterday afternoon following
actions and arguments by the
Coalition.
Meetings of SRI employees
began yesterday as four groups of
100 employees gathered to discuss
the question of the SRI-Stanford
relationship. Harry Cleaver,
co-author of the minority report,
claimed that it was "ridiculous
behavior to discuss the issues
when only the majority report
had been circulated."
The University Relations
Office, which supervised the
printing, apologized for the delay
in delivery yesterday, explaining
that the Bauer-Cleaver report was
received late and initial portions

of the report were thus sent to
SRI before the completed text
was available. The full text, as
printed in The Daily, was to be
sent to SRI yesterday.
As a result of short visits to
SRI and Encina Hall by
demonstrators (where the
multilith copies were stored), the
University shifted plans and sent
the multilith copies to SRI in
response to Cleaver's claim that
such copies were easier to read
than The Daily supplement.
Coalition Message
The full text of the Coalition
message to the Stanford
community follows:
"1. Since the University is
unable to agree on research
guidelines, and publish them in a
reasonable time, we have created
our own guidelines for the
University. And similarly, since
the Baxter Committee on
Research Policy is clearly an
inadequate body which has even
gone so far as to distort
information, we shall now
implement our own Research
Review Board to screen research
;o be conducted in our liberated
:ommune.
Therefore we ask our Research
Review Board to consider, in
public meetings, all requests from
AEL staff to resume research, as
long as the work meets the
stipulations in our GUIDELINES
FOR RESEARCH AT
STANFORD AND SRI. The
Research Review Board will
consult members from the
Stanford student body, faculty,
and staff, including certain AEL
staff members, in its review
function.
2. We believe our occupation
of AEL and use of printing
facilities here has helped the
community understand the issue
of military research on campus
and the need for action.
"We wish to dispel any rumors
that the printing equipment has
been damaged. We invite anyone
to examine the printing facilities
if they are concerned, and to help
us operate them around the clock
as we have been doing. We could
also use more paper.
"Our mission as a center for
discussion and printing literature
has not been completed as of

today. We must continue for the
present to provide this service to
the community. Naturally it is not
our only reason for remaining.
3. We wish to commend the
many members of the faculty who
have committed themselves to
work for the sweeping reform of
campus research that we have
asked. But their work has scarcely
begun.
The response of the Academic
Senate at its meeting April 15 was
token. We ask that all members of
the faculty give us their pledge
NOW that Stanford will do away
with classified research, research
for clear-cut military applications,
CBW, and counterinsurgency
research.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the
same kinds of research at SRI be
ended as soon as possible.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed

4. We know that many in the
community are worried about the
presence of classified documents
in locked files in AEL. We have
stated repeatedly our intention
not to open those files. But we do
feel obligated to continue to
prevent their use in research to
kill Vietnamese and others in the
Third World.
Join us."
Hayes' Announcement
The full text of Denis Hayes
meeting announcement follows:
Today a questionnaire on the
Stanford Research Institute is
being mailed to every student and
faculty member at Stanford. This
was decided upon by the
University Advisory Committee as
the most comprehensive method
of guaging student and faculty

opinion on the myriad issues
surrounding SRI.
The efficacy of this method of
sampling at this point in time has
been questioned by some; many
people are not fully apprised of all
the ramifications of the possible
courses of action.
There is, however, a certain
obvious urgency about this
matter, and the questionnaire is in
the mail. The results of this
questionnaire are certain to have
an enormous influence upon the
future of SRI. It is therefore
imperative that each member of
the Stanford community have an
opportunity to gain a thorough
understanding of the issues before
casting a ballot.
To help achieve this I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112. of the Constitution of
the Associated Students). The
meeting will be held at 2 p.m.
Friday, April 18, in Frost
Ampitheater.
There are few classes after this
time on Friday afternoons. I am
requesting any instructors whose
classes conflict with 'this meeting
to please reschedule them.
This meeting will be open to all
members of the Stanford
community. I hope that faculty,
administration, and employees- as
well as all find it
possible to attend. Blankets and
picnic lunches will make things
more comfortable.
I have not as yet established a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Anyone with specific proposals in
this regard should leave copies of
them in my mail box in the ASSU
Office in Tresidder by 3:30 this
afternoon.
More specific details
concerning the meeting will
appear in the Friday Daily.

Friday, April 18, in Frost
Ampitheater.
There are few classes after this
time on Friday afternoons. I am
requesting any instructors whose
classes conflict with 'this meeting
to please reschedule them.
This meeting will be open to all
members of the Stanford
community. I hope that faculty,
administration, and employees- as
well as all find it
possible to attend. Blankets and
picnic lunches will make things
more comfortable.
I have not as yet established a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Anyone with specific proposals in
this regard should leave copies of
them in my mail box in the ASSU
Office in Tresidder by 3:30 this
afternoon.
More specific details
concerning the meeting will
appear in the Friday Daily.
The Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) sit-in entered its second week last
night in a cresendo of activity, including
the following major developments:
• ASSU President Denis Hayes called
a special, unprecedented meeting of the
entire Stanford student body for Friday
at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
• University President Kenneth Pitzer
released a statement at 1:30 a.m.
strongly condemning the sit-in. (The full
text appears on Page 1 of The Daily.)
• In a large and tense meeting at AEL
last night, the demonstrators
overwhelmingly defeated a motion to
escalate the sit-in by occupying the new
space sciences building. The April 3
Coalition will hold a noon rally in White
Plaza today. Students continue to
occupy AEL.
• The Student Education Council
(SEC) requested that its reguiarly
scheduled meeting with the faculty
senate this afternoon be cancelled and
that senate meet alone to discuss
research policies at Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute, rather than
the SES items on the agenda. Senate
Chairman Leneord Schiff said last night
that the senate would not meet alone.
• In a flurry of activity in
mid-afternoon yesterday, sit-inners
made brief forays to SRI and Encina
Hall to protest failure to circulate the
minority report of the SRI committee
to the employees at SRI.
• The April 3 Coalition
overwhelmingly adopted a message to
the Stanford community declaring (1)
that its own guidelines on research
policy will be implemented by the
Coalition, including consideration of
allowing certain research to resume at
AEL, (2) that the AEL printing facilities
have not been damaged and have
provided a means of helping the
community understand the issues of

military research on campus, (3) that
the faculty senate action on Tuesday
evening was "token," and that the
faculty must "pledge NOW" that
Stanford will do away with questionable
research, and (4) that the Coalition
repeats its intention not to open any
classified files in AEL. (Full text
appears below.)
Pitzer Blasts Demonstration
Pitzer, in his statement, comments,
"In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to
teach."
He further remarks, "I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by the
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituences have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall."
The statement begins by
energetically condemning the failure of
demonstrators to give their names to
faculty and staff members to begin
hearings by the Stanford Judicial
Council. Pitzer says, "One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked.
"Let nobody think that his own
moral principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
learning in this and all other universities
is founded."
Classified Material
The president notes that classified
material in AEL is threatened by the
presence of the demonstrators and that
the University does not have final
control over policing by federal
authorities. He states, "Should the
federal government find it necessary to
actively take over this responsibility,
clearly the community will have lost, at
least in part, control over our own
affairs."
In announcing plans for the student
body meeting on Friday, Hayes states
that the questionnaire on SRI presently
being mailed to every student and
faculty member necessitates a thorough
knowledge of the issues at stake. He
says,"It is therefore imperative that
each member of the Stanford
community have an opportunity to gain
a thorough understanding of the issues
before casting a ballot.
"To help achieve this end I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112 of the Constitution of
the Associated Students)."
Hayes further states, "This
meeting is open to all members of
the Stanford community. I hope
that faculty, administration, and
employees —as well as
students—will find it possible to
attend."
Hayes has not yet prepared a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Specific proposals should be left
in his mail box in the ASSU office
in Tresidder Union by 3:30 p.m.
today.
Hayes commented last night
that he was not sure the sit-in
would be discussed at the
meeting.
During a five hour meeting at
AEL last night, more than 400
students discussed and voted on
questions of further tactics.
Numerous proposals were
presented, some calling for
escalation by occupying the space
sciences building, and holding a
one day strike. Other proposals
suggested leaving AEL and ending
the sit-in.
Members of the Coalition
charged yesterday that the
University had witheld the full
text of the SRI committee report
from the employees at SRI. The
entire text of the report was
printed by multilith process over
the weekend, but the
Cleaver-Bauer report was not
circulated at SRI until late
yesterday afternoon following
actions and arguments by the
Coalition.
Meetings of SRI employees
began yesterday as four groups of
100 employees gathered to discuss
the question of the SRI-Stanford
relationship. Harry Cleaver,
co-author of the minority report,
claimed that it was "ridiculous
behavior to discuss the issues
when only the majority report
had been circulated."
The University Relations
Office, which supervised the
printing, apologized for the delay
in delivery yesterday, explaining
that the Bauer-Cleaver report was
received late and initial portions

of the report were thus sent to
SRI before the completed text
was available. The full text, as
printed in The Daily, was to be
sent to SRI yesterday.
As a result of short visits to
SRI and Encina Hall by
demonstrators (where the
multilith copies were stored), the
University shifted plans and sent
the multilith copies to SRI in
response to Cleaver's claim that
such copies were easier to read
than The Daily supplement.
Coalition Message
The full text of the Coalition
message to the Stanford
community follows:
"1. Since the University is
unable to agree on research
guidelines, and publish them in a
reasonable time, we have created
our own guidelines for the
University. And similarly, since
the Baxter Committee on
Research Policy is clearly an
inadequate body which has even
gone so far as to distort
information, we shall now
implement our own Research
Review Board to screen research
;o be conducted in our liberated
:ommune.
Therefore we ask our Research
Review Board to consider, in
public meetings, all requests from
AEL staff to resume research, as
long as the work meets the
stipulations in our GUIDELINES
FOR RESEARCH AT
STANFORD AND SRI. The
Research Review Board will
consult members from the
Stanford student body, faculty,
and staff, including certain AEL
staff members, in its review
function.
2. We believe our occupation
of AEL and use of printing
facilities here has helped the
community understand the issue
of military research on campus
and the need for action.
"We wish to dispel any rumors
that the printing equipment has
been damaged. We invite anyone
to examine the printing facilities
if they are concerned, and to help
us operate them around the clock
as we have been doing. We could
also use more paper.
"Our mission as a center for
discussion and printing literature
has not been completed as of

today. We must continue for the
present to provide this service to
the community. Naturally it is not
our only reason for remaining.
3. We wish to commend the
many members of the faculty who
have committed themselves to
work for the sweeping reform of
campus research that we have
asked. But their work has scarcely
begun.
The response of the Academic
Senate at its meeting April 15 was
token. We ask that all members of
the faculty give us their pledge
NOW that Stanford will do away
with classified research, research
for clear-cut military applications,
CBW, and counterinsurgency
research.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the
same kinds of research at SRI be
ended as soon as possible.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the

4. We know that many in the
community are worried about the
presence of classified documents
in locked files in AEL. We have
stated repeatedly our intention
not to open those files. But we do
feel obligated to continue to
prevent their use in research to
kill Vietnamese and others in the
Third World.
Join us."
Hayes' Announcement
The full text of Denis Hayes
meeting announcement follows:
Today a questionnaire on the
Stanford Research Institute is
being mailed to every student and
faculty member at Stanford. This
was decided upon by the
University Advisory Committee as
the most comprehensive method
of guaging student and faculty

opinion on the myriad issues
surrounding SRI.
The efficacy of this method of
sampling at this point in time has
been questioned by some; many
people are not fully apprised of all
the ramifications of the possible
courses of action.
There is, however, a certain
obvious urgency about this
matter, and the questionnaire is in
the mail. The results of this
questionnaire are certain to have
an enormous influence upon the
future of SRI. It is therefore
imperative that each member of
the Stanford community have an
opportunity to gain a thorough
understanding of the issues before
casting a ballot.
To help achieve this I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112. of the Constitution of
the Associated Students). The
meeting will be held at 2 p.m.

been questioned by some; many
people are not fully apprised of all
the ramifications of the possible
courses of action.
There is, however, a certain
obvious urgency about this
matter, and the questionnaire is in
the mail. The results of this
questionnaire are certain to have
an enormous influence upon the
future of SRI. It is therefore
imperative that each member of
the Stanford community have an
opportunity to gain a thorough
understanding of the issues before
casting a ballot.
To help achieve this I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112. of the Constitution of
the Associated Students). The
meeting will be held at 2 p.m.
Friday, April 18, in Frost
Ampitheater.
There are few classes after this
time on Friday afternoons. I am
requesting any instructors whose
classes conflict with 'this meeting
to please reschedule them.
This meeting will be open to all
members of the Stanford
community. I hope that faculty,
administration, and employees- as
well as all find it
possible to attend. Blankets and
picnic lunches will make things
more comfortable.
I have not as yet established a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Anyone with specific proposals in
this regard should leave copies of
them in my mail box in the ASSU
Office in Tresidder by 3:30 this
afternoon.
More specific details
concerning the meeting will
appear in the Friday Daily.
The Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) sit-in entered its second week last
night in a cresendo of activity, including
the following major developments:
• ASSU President Denis Hayes called
a special, unprecedented meeting of the
entire Stanford student body for Friday
at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
• University President Kenneth Pitzer
released a statement at 1:30 a.m.
strongly condemning the sit-in. (The full
text appears on Page 1 of The Daily.)
• In a large and tense meeting at AEL
last night, the demonstrators
overwhelmingly defeated a motion to
escalate the sit-in by occupying the new
space sciences building. The April 3
Coalition will hold a noon rally in White
Plaza today. Students continue to
occupy AEL.
• The Student Education Council
(SEC) requested that its reguiarly
scheduled meeting with the faculty
senate this afternoon be cancelled and
that senate meet alone to discuss
research policies at Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute, rather than
the SES items on the agenda. Senate
Chairman Leneord Schiff said last night
that the senate would not meet alone.
• In a flurry of activity in
mid-afternoon yesterday, sit-inners
made brief forays to SRI and Encina
Hall to protest failure to circulate the
minority report of the SRI committee
to the employees at SRI.
• The April 3 Coalition
overwhelmingly adopted a message to
the Stanford community declaring (1)
that its own guidelines on research
policy will be implemented by the
Coalition, including consideration of
allowing certain research to resume at
AEL, (2) that the AEL printing facilities
have not been damaged and have
provided a means of helping the
community understand the issues of

military research on campus, (3) that
the faculty senate action on Tuesday
evening was "token," and that the
faculty must "pledge NOW" that
Stanford will do away with questionable
research, and (4) that the Coalition
repeats its intention not to open any
classified files in AEL. (Full text
appears below.)
Pitzer Blasts Demonstration
Pitzer, in his statement, comments,
"In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to
teach."
He further remarks, "I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by the
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituences have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall."
The statement begins by
energetically condemning the failure of
demonstrators to give their names to
faculty and staff members to begin
hearings by the Stanford Judicial
Council. Pitzer says, "One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked.
"Let nobody think that his own
moral principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
learning in this and all other universities
is founded."
Classified Material
The president notes that classified
material in AEL is threatened by the
presence of the demonstrators and that
the University does not have final
control over policing by federal
authorities. He states, "Should the
federal government find it necessary to
actively take over this responsibility,
clearly the community will have lost, at
least in part, control over our own
affairs."
In announcing plans for the student
body meeting on Friday, Hayes states
that the questionnaire on SRI presently
being mailed to every student and
faculty member necessitates a thorough
knowledge of the issues at stake. He
says,"It is therefore imperative that
each member of the Stanford
community have an opportunity to gain
a thorough understanding of the issues
before casting a ballot.
"To help achieve this end I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112 of the Constitution of
the Associated Students)."
Hayes further states, "This
meeting is open to all members of
the Stanford community. I hope
that faculty, administration, and
employees —as well as
students—will find it possible to
attend."
Hayes has not yet prepared a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Specific proposals should be left
in his mail box in the ASSU office
in Tresidder Union by 3:30 p.m.
today.
Hayes commented last night
that he was not sure the sit-in
would be discussed at the
meeting.
During a five hour meeting at
AEL last night, more than 400
students discussed and voted on
questions of further tactics.
Numerous proposals were
presented, some calling for
escalation by occupying the space
sciences building, and holding a
one day strike. Other proposals
suggested leaving AEL and ending
the sit-in.
Members of the Coalition
charged yesterday that the
University had witheld the full
text of the SRI committee report
from the employees at SRI. The
entire text of the report was
printed by multilith process over
the weekend, but the
Cleaver-Bauer report was not
circulated at SRI until late
yesterday afternoon following
actions and arguments by the
Coalition.
Meetings of SRI employees
began yesterday as four groups of
100 employees gathered to discuss
the question of the SRI-Stanford
relationship. Harry Cleaver,
co-author of the minority report,
claimed that it was "ridiculous
behavior to discuss the issues
when only the majority report
had been circulated."
The University Relations
Office, which supervised the
printing, apologized for the delay
in delivery yesterday, explaining
that the Bauer-Cleaver report was
received late and initial portions

of the report were thus sent to
SRI before the completed text
was available. The full text, as
printed in The Daily, was to be
sent to SRI yesterday.
As a result of short visits to
SRI and Encina Hall by
demonstrators (where the
multilith copies were stored), the
University shifted plans and sent
the multilith copies to SRI in
response to Cleaver's claim that
such copies were easier to read
than The Daily supplement.
Coalition Message
The full text of the Coalition
message to the Stanford
community follows:
"1. Since the University is
unable to agree on research
guidelines, and publish them in a
reasonable time, we have created
our own guidelines for the
University. And similarly, since
the Baxter Committee on
Research Policy is clearly an
inadequate body which has even
gone so far as to distort
information, we shall now
implement our own Research
Review Board to screen research
;o be conducted in our liberated
:ommune.
Therefore we ask our Research
Review Board to consider, in
public meetings, all requests from
AEL staff to resume research, as
long as the work meets the
stipulations in our GUIDELINES
FOR RESEARCH AT
STANFORD AND SRI. The
Research Review Board will
consult members from the
Stanford student body, faculty,
and staff, including certain AEL
staff members, in its review
function.
2. We believe our occupation
of AEL and use of printing
facilities here has helped the
community understand the issue
of military research on campus
and the need for action.
"We wish to dispel any rumors
that the printing equipment has
been damaged. We invite anyone
to examine the printing facilities
if they are concerned, and to help
us operate them around the clock
as we have been doing. We could
also use more paper.
"Our mission as a center for
discussion and printing literature
has not been completed as of

today. We must continue for the
present to provide this service to
the community. Naturally it is not
our only reason for remaining.
3. We wish to commend the
many members of the faculty who
have committed themselves to
work for the sweeping reform of
campus research that we have
asked. But their work has scarcely
begun.
The response of the Academic
Senate at its meeting April 15 was
token. We ask that all members of
the faculty give us their pledge
NOW that Stanford will do away
with classified research, research
for clear-cut military applications,
CBW, and counterinsurgency
research.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the
same kinds of research at SRI be
ended as soon as possible.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the
same kinds of research at SRI be

4. We know that many in the
community are worried about the
presence of classified documents
in locked files in AEL. We have
stated repeatedly our intention
not to open those files. But we do
feel obligated to continue to
prevent their use in research to
kill Vietnamese and others in the
Third World.
Join us."
Hayes' Announcement
The full text of Denis Hayes
meeting announcement follows:
Today a questionnaire on the
Stanford Research Institute is
being mailed to every student and

University Advisory Committee as

of guaging student and faculty

opinion on the myriad issues
surrounding SRI.

4. We know that many in the
community are worried about the
presence of classified documents
in locked files in AEL. We have
stated repeatedly our intention
not to open those files. But we do
feel obligated to continue to
prevent their use in research to
kill Vietnamese and others in the
Third World.
Join us."
Hayes' Announcement
The full text of Denis Hayes
meeting announcement follows:
Today a questionnaire on the
Stanford Research Institute is
being mailed to every student and
faculty member at Stanford. This
was decided upon by the
University Advisory Committee as
the most comprehensive method
of guaging student and faculty

opinion on the myriad issues
surrounding SRI.
The efficacy of this method of
sampling at this point in time has
been questioned by some; many
people are not fully apprised of all
the ramifications of the possible
courses of action.
There is, however, a certain
obvious urgency about this
matter, and the questionnaire is in
the mail. The results of this
questionnaire are certain to have
an enormous influence upon the
future of SRI. It is therefore
imperative that each member of
the Stanford community have an
opportunity to gain a thorough
understanding of the issues before
casting a ballot.
To help achieve this I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112. of the Constitution of
the Associated Students). The
meeting will be held at 2 p.m.
Friday, April 18, in Frost
Ampitheater.
There are few classes after this
time on Friday afternoons. I am
requesting any instructors whose
classes conflict with 'this meeting
to please reschedule them.
This meeting will be open to all
members of the Stanford
community. I hope that faculty,
administration, and employees- as
well as all find it
possible to attend. Blankets and
picnic lunches will make things
more comfortable.
I have not as yet established a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Anyone with specific proposals in
this regard should leave copies of
them in my mail box in the ASSU
Office in Tresidder by 3:30 this
afternoon.
More specific details
concerning the meeting will
appear in the Friday Daily.
The Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) sit-in entered its second week last
night in a cresendo of activity, including
the following major developments:
• ASSU President Denis Hayes called
a special, unprecedented meeting of the
entire Stanford student body for Friday
at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
• University President Kenneth Pitzer
released a statement at 1:30 a.m.
strongly condemning the sit-in. (The full
text appears on Page 1 of The Daily.)
• In a large and tense meeting at AEL
last night, the demonstrators
overwhelmingly defeated a motion to
escalate the sit-in by occupying the new
space sciences building. The April 3
Coalition will hold a noon rally in White
Plaza today. Students continue to
occupy AEL.
• The Student Education Council
(SEC) requested that its reguiarly
scheduled meeting with the faculty
senate this afternoon be cancelled and
that senate meet alone to discuss
research policies at Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute, rather than
the SES items on the agenda. Senate
Chairman Leneord Schiff said last night
that the senate would not meet alone.
• In a flurry of activity in
mid-afternoon yesterday, sit-inners
made brief forays to SRI and Encina
Hall to protest failure to circulate the
minority report of the SRI committee
to the employees at SRI.
• The April 3 Coalition
overwhelmingly adopted a message to
the Stanford community declaring (1)
that its own guidelines on research
policy will be implemented by the
Coalition, including consideration of
allowing certain research to resume at
AEL, (2) that the AEL printing facilities
have not been damaged and have
provided a means of helping the
community understand the issues of

military research on campus, (3) that
the faculty senate action on Tuesday
evening was "token," and that the
faculty must "pledge NOW" that
Stanford will do away with questionable
research, and (4) that the Coalition
repeats its intention not to open any
classified files in AEL. (Full text
appears below.)
Pitzer Blasts Demonstration
Pitzer, in his statement, comments,
"In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to
teach."
He further remarks, "I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by the
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituences have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall."
The statement begins by
energetically condemning the failure of
demonstrators to give their names to
faculty and staff members to begin
hearings by the Stanford Judicial
Council. Pitzer says, "One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked.
"Let nobody think that his own
moral principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
learning in this and all other universities
is founded."
Classified Material
The president notes that classified
material in AEL is threatened by the
presence of the demonstrators and that
the University does not have final
control over policing by federal
authorities. He states, "Should the
federal government find it necessary to
actively take over this responsibility,
clearly the community will have lost, at
least in part, control over our own
affairs."
In announcing plans for the student
body meeting on Friday, Hayes states
that the questionnaire on SRI presently
being mailed to every student and
faculty member necessitates a thorough
knowledge of the issues at stake. He
says,"It is therefore imperative that
each member of the Stanford
community have an opportunity to gain
a thorough understanding of the issues
before casting a ballot.
"To help achieve this end I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112 of the Constitution of
the Associated Students)."
Hayes further states, "This
meeting is open to all members of
the Stanford community. I hope
that faculty, administration, and
employees —as well as
students—will find it possible to
attend."
Hayes has not yet prepared a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Specific proposals should be left
in his mail box in the ASSU office
in Tresidder Union by 3:30 p.m.
today.
Hayes commented last night
that he was not sure the sit-in
would be discussed at the
meeting.
During a five hour meeting at
AEL last night, more than 400
students discussed and voted on
questions of further tactics.
Numerous proposals were
presented, some calling for
escalation by occupying the space
sciences building, and holding a
one day strike. Other proposals
suggested leaving AEL and ending
the sit-in.
Members of the Coalition
charged yesterday that the
University had witheld the full
text of the SRI committee report
from the employees at SRI. The
entire text of the report was
printed by multilith process over
the weekend, but the
Cleaver-Bauer report was not
circulated at SRI until late
yesterday afternoon following
actions and arguments by the
Coalition.
Meetings of SRI employees
began yesterday as four groups of
100 employees gathered to discuss
the question of the SRI-Stanford
relationship. Harry Cleaver,
co-author of the minority report,
claimed that it was "ridiculous
behavior to discuss the issues
when only the majority report
had been circulated."
The University Relations
Office, which supervised the
printing, apologized for the delay
in delivery yesterday, explaining
that the Bauer-Cleaver report was
received late and initial portions

of the report were thus sent to
SRI before the completed text
was available. The full text, as
printed in The Daily, was to be
sent to SRI yesterday.
As a result of short visits to
SRI and Encina Hall by
demonstrators (where the
multilith copies were stored), the
University shifted plans and sent
the multilith copies to SRI in
response to Cleaver's claim that
such copies were easier to read
than The Daily supplement.
Coalition Message
The full text of the Coalition
message to the Stanford
community follows:
"1. Since the University is
unable to agree on research
guidelines, and publish them in a
reasonable time, we have created
our own guidelines for the
University. And similarly, since
the Baxter Committee on
Research Policy is clearly an
inadequate body which has even
gone so far as to distort
information, we shall now
implement our own Research
Review Board to screen research
;o be conducted in our liberated
:ommune.
Therefore we ask our Research
Review Board to consider, in
public meetings, all requests from
AEL staff to resume research, as
long as the work meets the
stipulations in our GUIDELINES
FOR RESEARCH AT
STANFORD AND SRI. The
Research Review Board will
consult members from the
Stanford student body, faculty,
and staff, including certain AEL
staff members, in its review
function.
2. We believe our occupation
of AEL and use of printing
facilities here has helped the
community understand the issue
of military research on campus
and the need for action.
"We wish to dispel any rumors
that the printing equipment has
been damaged. We invite anyone
to examine the printing facilities
if they are concerned, and to help
us operate them around the clock
as we have been doing. We could
also use more paper.
"Our mission as a center for
discussion and printing literature
has not been completed as of

today. We must continue for the
present to provide this service to
the community. Naturally it is not
our only reason for remaining.
3. We wish to commend the
many members of the faculty who
have committed themselves to
work for the sweeping reform of
campus research that we have
asked. But their work has scarcely
begun.
The response of the Academic
Senate at its meeting April 15 was
token. We ask that all members of
the faculty give us their pledge
NOW that Stanford will do away
with classified research, research
for clear-cut military applications,
CBW, and counterinsurgency
research.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the
same kinds of research at SRI be
ended as soon as possible.

have committed themselves to
work for the sweeping reform of
campus research that we have
asked. But their work has scarcely
begun.
The response of the Academic
Senate at its meeting April 15 was
token. We ask that all members of
the faculty give us their pledge
NOW that Stanford will do away
with classified research, research
for clear-cut military applications,
CBW, and counterinsurgency
research.
We further urge that you state
your wish that SRI not be severed
from the University and that the
same kinds of research at SRI be
ended as soon as possible.
We further urge that you state

4. We know that many in the
community are worried about the
presence of classified documents
in locked files in AEL. We have
stated repeatedly our intention
not to open those files. But we do
feel obligated to continue to
prevent their use in research to
kill Vietnamese and others in the
Third World.
Join us."
Hayes' Announcement
The full text of Denis Hayes
meeting announcement follows:
Today a questionnaire on the
Stanford Research Institute is
being mailed to every student and
faculty member at Stanford. This
was decided upon by the
University Advisory Committee as
the most comprehensive method
of guaging student and faculty

opinion on the myriad issues
surrounding SRI.
The efficacy of this method of
sampling at this point in time has
been questioned by some; many
people are not fully apprised of all
the ramifications of the possible
courses of action.
There is, however, a certain
obvious urgency about this
matter, and the questionnaire is in
the mail. The results of this
questionnaire are certain to have
an enormous influence upon the
future of SRI. It is therefore
imperative that each member of
the Stanford community have an
opportunity to gain a thorough
understanding of the issues before
casting a ballot.
To help achieve this I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112. of the Constitution of
the Associated Students). The
meeting will be held at 2 p.m.
Friday, April 18, in Frost
Ampitheater.
There are few classes after this
time on Friday afternoons. I am
requesting any instructors whose
classes conflict with 'this meeting
to please reschedule them.
This meeting will be open to all
members of the Stanford
community. I hope that faculty,
administration, and employees- as
well as all find it
possible to attend. Blankets and
picnic lunches will make things
more comfortable.
I have not as yet established a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Anyone with specific proposals in
this regard should leave copies of
them in my mail box in the ASSU
Office in Tresidder by 3:30 this
afternoon.
More specific details
concerning the meeting will
appear in the Friday Daily.
The Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) sit-in entered its second week last
night in a cresendo of activity, including
the following major developments:
• ASSU President Denis Hayes called
a special, unprecedented meeting of the
entire Stanford student body for Friday
at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
• University President Kenneth Pitzer
released a statement at 1:30 a.m.
strongly condemning the sit-in. (The full
text appears on Page 1 of The Daily.)
• In a large and tense meeting at AEL
last night, the demonstrators
overwhelmingly defeated a motion to
escalate the sit-in by occupying the new
space sciences building. The April 3
Coalition will hold a noon rally in White
Plaza today. Students continue to
occupy AEL.
• The Student Education Council
(SEC) requested that its reguiarly
scheduled meeting with the faculty
senate this afternoon be cancelled and
that senate meet alone to discuss
research policies at Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute, rather than
the SES items on the agenda. Senate
Chairman Leneord Schiff said last night
that the senate would not meet alone.
• In a flurry of activity in
mid-afternoon yesterday, sit-inners
made brief forays to SRI and Encina
Hall to protest failure to circulate the
minority report of the SRI committee
to the employees at SRI.
• The April 3 Coalition
overwhelmingly adopted a message to
the Stanford community declaring (1)
that its own guidelines on research
policy will be implemented by the
Coalition, including consideration of
allowing certain research to resume at
AEL, (2) that the AEL printing facilities
have not been damaged and have
provided a means of helping the
community understand the issues of

military research on campus, (3) that
the faculty senate action on Tuesday
evening was "token," and that the
faculty must "pledge NOW" that
Stanford will do away with questionable
research, and (4) that the Coalition
repeats its intention not to open any
classified files in AEL. (Full text
appears below.)
Pitzer Blasts Demonstration
Pitzer, in his statement, comments,
"In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to
teach."
He further remarks, "I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by the
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituences have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall."
The statement begins by
energetically condemning the failure of
demonstrators to give their names to
faculty and staff members to begin
hearings by the Stanford Judicial
Council. Pitzer says, "One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked.
"Let nobody think that his own
moral principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
learning in this and all other universities
is founded."
Classified Material
The president notes that classified
material in AEL is threatened by the
presence of the demonstrators and that
the University does not have final
control over policing by federal
authorities. He states, "Should the
federal government find it necessary to
actively take over this responsibility,
clearly the community will have lost, at
least in part, control over our own
affairs."
In announcing plans for the student
body meeting on Friday, Hayes states
that the questionnaire on SRI presently
being mailed to every student and
faculty member necessitates a thorough
knowledge of the issues at stake. He
says,"It is therefore imperative that
each member of the Stanford
community have an opportunity to gain
a thorough understanding of the issues
before casting a ballot.
"To help achieve this end I am
calling a general meeting of the
entire Stanford student body (as
provided for in Article 11, Section
2, Part 112 of the Constitution of
the Associated Students)."
Hayes further states, "This
meeting is open to all members of
the Stanford community. I hope
that faculty, administration, and
employees —as well as
students—will find it possible to
attend."
Hayes has not yet prepared a
formal agenda for the meeting.
Specific proposals should be left
in his mail box in the ASSU office
in Tresidder Union by 3:30 p.m.
today.
Hayes commented last night
that he was not sure the sit-in
would be discussed at the
meeting.
During a five hour meeting at
AEL last night, more than 400
students discussed and voted on
questions of further tactics.
Numerous proposals were
presented, some calling for
escalation by occupying the space
sciences building, and holding a
one day strike. Other proposals
suggested leaving AEL and ending
the sit-in.
Members of the Coalition
charged yesterday that the
University had witheld the full
text of the SRI committee report
from the employees at SRI. The
entire text of the report was
printed by multilith process over
the weekend, but the
Cleaver-Bauer report was not
circulated at SRI until late
yesterday afternoon following
actions and arguments by the
Coalition.
Meetings of SRI employees
began yesterday as four groups of
100 employees gathered to discuss
the question of the SRI-Stanford
relationship. Harry Cleaver,
co-author of the minority report,
claimed that it was "ridiculous
behavior to discuss the issues
when only the majority report
had been circulated."
The University Relations
Office, which supervised the
printing, apologized for the delay
in delivery yesterday, explaining
that the Bauer-Cleaver report was
received late and initial portions

of the report were thus sent to
SRI before the completed text
was available. The full text, as
printed in The Daily, was to be
sent to SRI yesterday.
As a result of short visits to
SRI and Encina Hall by
demonstrators (where the
multilith copies were stored), the
University shifted plans and sent
the multilith copies to SRI in
response to Cleaver's claim that
such copies were easier to read
than The Daily supplement.
Coalition Message
The full text of the Coalition
message to the Stanford
community follows:
"1. Since the University is
unable to agree on research
guidelines, and publish them in a
reasonable time, we have created
our own guidelines for the
University. And similarly, since
the Baxter Committee on
Research Policy is clearly an
inadequate body which has even
gone so far as to distort
information, we shall now
implement our own Research
Review Board to screen research
;o be conducted in our liberated
:ommune.
Therefore we ask our Research
Review Board to consider, in
public meetings, all requests from
AEL staff to resume research, as
long as the work meets the
stipulations in our GUIDELINES
FOR RESEARCH AT
STANFORD AND SRI. The
Research Review Board will
consult members from the
Stanford student body, faculty,
and staff, including certain AEL
staff members, in its review
function.
2. We believe our occupation
of AEL and use of printing
facilities here has helped the
community understand the issue
of military research on campus
and the need for action.
"We wish to dispel any rumors
that the printing equipment has
been damaged. We invite anyone
to examine the printing facilities
if they are concerned, and to help
us operate them around the clock
as we have been doing. We could
also use more paper.
"Our mission as a center for
discussion and printing literature
has not been completed as of

today. We must continue for the
present to provide this service to
the community. Naturally it is not
our only reason for remaining.
3. We wish to commend the
many members of the faculty who
have committed themselves to
work for the sweeping reform of
campus research that we have

begun.
