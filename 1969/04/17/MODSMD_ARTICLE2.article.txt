# Occupation Continues
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
The Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) sit-in entered its second week last
night in a cresendo of activity, including
the following major developments:
• ASSU President Denis Hayes called
a special, unprecedented meeting of the
entire Stanford student body for Friday
at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
• University President Kenneth Pitzer
released a statement at 1:30 a.m.
strongly condemning the sit-in. (The full
text appears on Page 1 of The Daily.)
• In a large and tense meeting at AEL
last night, the demonstrators
overwhelmingly defeated a motion to
escalate the sit-in by occupying the new
space sciences building. The April 3
Coalition will hold a noon rally in White
Plaza today. Students continue to
occupy AEL.
• The Student Education Council
(SEC) requested that its reguiarly
scheduled meeting with the faculty
senate this afternoon be cancelled and
that senate meet alone to discuss
research policies at Stanford and the
Stanford Research Institute, rather than
the SES items on the agenda. Senate
Chairman Leneord Schiff said last night
that the senate would not meet alone.
• In a flurry of activity in
mid-afternoon yesterday, sit-inners
made brief forays to SRI and Encina
Hall to protest failure to circulate the
minority report of the SRI committee
to the employees at SRI.
• The April 3 Coalition
overwhelmingly adopted a message to
the Stanford community declaring (1)
that its own guidelines on research
policy will be implemented by the
Coalition, including consideration of
allowing certain research to resume at
AEL, (2) that the AEL printing facilities
have not been damaged and have
provided a means of helping the
community understand the issues of

military research on campus, (3) that
the faculty senate action on Tuesday
evening was "token," and that the
faculty must "pledge NOW" that
Stanford will do away with questionable
research, and (4) that the Coalition
repeats its intention not to open any
classified files in AEL. (Full text
appears below.)
Pitzer Blasts Demonstration
Pitzer, in his statement, comments,
"In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to
teach."
He further remarks, "I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by the
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituences have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall."
The statement begins by
energetically condemning the failure of
demonstrators to give their names to
faculty and staff members to begin
hearings by the Stanford Judicial
Council. Pitzer says, "One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked.
"Let nobody think that his own
moral principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
learning in this and all other universities
is founded."
Classified Material
The president notes that classified
material in AEL is threatened by the
presence of the demonstrators and that
the University does not have final
control over policing by federal
authorities. He states, "Should the
federal government find it necessary to
actively take over this responsibility,
clearly the community will have lost, at
least in part, control over our own
affairs."
In announcing plans for the student
body meeting on Friday, Hayes states
that the questionnaire on SRI presently
being mailed to every student and
faculty member necessitates a thorough
knowledge of the issues at stake. He
says,"It is therefore imperative that
each member of the Stanford
community have an opportunity to gain
a thorough understanding of the issues
before casting a ballot.
