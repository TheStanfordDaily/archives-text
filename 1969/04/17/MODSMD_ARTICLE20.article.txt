# Students Gain A Voice
## Hayes Presidency Builds Respect 
### MARIAN MOE 
The resignation of two former
presidents and the campaign of a
topless dancer are hard acts to
follow, even in the often
circus-like ring of student politics.
Denis Hayes, as ASSU
President, has had his job cut out
for him in simply changing the
image of student government.
Vicki Drake's verdict of its "not
being worth a tinker's damn" is
no longer valid to those students
as well as administrators for
whom it has gained credibility.
"The ASSU," in Hayes'
opinion, "has reached the point
where no fundamental decision
affecting students will be made
without asking students."
Students are presently on 78
different University committees
and study groups. This alone is
considered a major
accomplishment by many
students. People are starting to
recognize the contributions
students can make," says Hayes,
"which include work, time and a
unique perspective."
This new attitude that students
have a right to make decisions
affecting them corresponds to the
mood of students across the
nation. Student government at
Stanford has tried to reorganize
the structure of existing
institutions to allow students to
express their opinions.
The committees with students
on them are making decisions that
affect issues important to them.

For example, the Committee on
Research Policy is studying the
relationship of the University to
research and if and how it should
be changed. Students are on the
search committees for all major
personnel, including the new Dean
of Students and a new trustee.
There are students studying and
getting administrative response on
student housing and ROTC. In the
past, students were rarely, if ever,
consulted on such issues.
"Students are playing a larger
part in forming policy maybe
more than they know,"says
Provost Lyman.
Lyman, along with Hayes,
believes that a smaller group of
representative students is needed
to make student government more
effective. Both the constitution
defeated last fall and the proposed
ASSU Constitution would provide
for this.
The Student Education
Council (SEC), which together
with the Academic Senate, passes
judgment on the SES
recommendations, is seen by some
as a step toward a smaller
legislature. Hayes also sees it as a
stage moving toward community
government.
"Stanford is moving toward
community government more
than any other major institution
in the country," he says."The
University Advisory Committee,
with equal student, faculty, and
trustee representation, is not only
a move toward community

government but also a powerful
body where students are given as
much power as the other
constituencies."
Representative Power
As both students and faculty
become more sure of themselves,
they will be able to assert power
in more constructive ways. "By
gaining self-respect, Â« each
constituency is able to work
better with the others," says
Hayes.
Hayes is admired for the
amount of time and energy he
spends working for change.
President Pitzer observes, "Hayes
saw that changes were possible
and has been pressing hard for
them. We will look back to this as
a time of substantial change that
will have effects in the future."

Some students criticize the
friendships that Hayes has built
up with important faculty and
administrative members as
co-option to the "other side."
Hayes sees it more as overcoming
the age-old distrust of the trustees
and those in power.
A ttitudes Change
To many observers, Hayes has
established a pattern in student
participation which will continue
and influence the future in
student government. Yale
Braunstein, Speaker of the
Legislature, says"The Education
Council would have been
unthinkable a year ago. Student
attitudes have changed."
Most people seem to feel that
the greatest impact of Hayes'

administration has been increased
student awareness. Dean Smith
feels that "the greatest
accomplishment will be regarded
as having alerted the community
to a number of vital changes in a
strong way."
Many students feel that the
increase in student participation
would have come anyway. Hayes'
administration cannot be
distinguished from the greater
student participation across the
nation.
Although not satisfied with the
accomplishments of his
administration, Hayes thinks that
"I've done as much this year as
could be done within the system.
I hope someone will be here to
continue and improve what's been
done."
