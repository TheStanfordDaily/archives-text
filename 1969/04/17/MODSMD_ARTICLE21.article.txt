## Eisenstein, Antonioni 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Sergei Eisenstein's Strike will
be shown in Cubberley on
Thursday at 4:15. In this, his first
film, Eisenstein experimented
with the montage techniques that
were to mark his subsequent
pictures. This one deals with
unjust working conditions in

pre-revolutionary Russia and the
struggle to change them.
The International Center's
Thursday film is Antonioni's The
Ked Desert, to be shown in
Physics Tank at 8:15. I personally
find his work deadly dull, but
many acclaimed Antonioni for his
experimentation here with color.

It features Monica Vitti and
Richard Harris (who stormed out
in disgust after just two-thirds of
the film had been shotâ€”much of
his character's action was
performed by a double).
Luis Bunuel's Los Olvidados is
one of the most trenchant,
shattering looks at the victims of
society that I've ever seen. Made
in Mexico in 1951, the film
dissects the problems of poverty
and the inevitable juvenile
delinquency that makes life in the
slums even more intolerable. The
film (sometimes called The Young
and the Damned) carves itself in
the mind and the included dream
sequence is perhaps the most
haunting and brilliant ever put on
film. At Tresidder on Friday
night.
Alfred Hitchcock's Shadow of
a Doubt, showing Saturday night
at Tresidder, is one of the
director's own favorite films.
Written by Thornton Wilder, the
picture stars Joseph Cotten and
Teresa Wright. Top-grade
Hitchcock.
A mere two years after its
release, it seems unlikely that too
many people could take In the
Heat of the Night seriously.
Despite its inherent simplicity,
this week's Sunday flick can still
be enjoyed thanks to Rod
Steiger's juicy performance,
Quinoy Jones' music and the
stunning photography by Haskell
Wexler.
