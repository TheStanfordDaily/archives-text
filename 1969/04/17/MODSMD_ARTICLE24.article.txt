# Political Journal?
## 
### 
Stanford's increasingly
politicized campus may be treated
to a political magazine this spring.
ASSU Vice-President Victor
von Schlegell is urging the
formation of a journal of political
essays to be called Political
Perspectives. He envisions a
magazine of some 80 pages,
resembling the Faculty Directory
in its binding and size.
The content of the magazine
would be derived from student
and faculty contributions and,
von Schlegall said, "not
necessarily adhering to any given

ideology or topic."
Von Schlegall is suggesting a
trial-run edition for this spring of
1000 copies. Presumably, initial
costs would be defrayed by the
ASSU.
The content of Political
Perspectives would be determined,
von Schlegall suggested, by a
four-man review board divided
equally between students and
faculty. He envisions topics such
as "A Conservative Perspective on
the Radical Movement, "Theology
and War," and "Stanford's
Political Influence in the Bay
Area."
