# Pot Collection To Be Discussed
## 
### 
The Stanford University
Museum's famous collection of
ancient Cypriot pots will be the
subject of a talk to members of
the Committee for Art at
Stanford on Thursday morning,
April 17, at 10 a.m. Professor
Isabelle Raubitschek, a specialist
in classical archaeology, will
describe the collection and
conduct members of the audience
through the basement work rooms
where the majority of the
collection is studied and stored.
The history of the Cypriot pots
at Stanford begins in 1884. At
that time Mrs. Stanford bought
them from the Metropolitan
Museum, which was disposing of
its duplicates.
The thousands of vases and
statuettes of stone and terra cotta
were unbelievably shattered by
the earthquake of 1906. Dr. Hazel
Hansen, a professor of classics,
undertook the formidable task of
sorting and mending the
fragments. Miss Hansen continued
instructing her students in the
delicate art of pot-mending until
her death in 1962.
Two years later Professor
T.B.L. Webster began the chore of
cataloguing the collection. Mr.
Webster has published pictures of
some of the more important vases
and figurines in scholarly journals.
Mrs. Raubitschek has taken up the
challenge of the work, training
some of her students in
museology in the process of
working to complete the
catalogue.

As she has studied the Cypriot
collection, which ranges in period
from Early Bronze Age through
the Roman period (1500
8.C.-600 A.D.), Mrs.
Raubitschek has discovered many
duplications and even
quadruplications.
Professor Raubitschek's lecture
will be held in the Meidel Room
of the Stanford Museum.
