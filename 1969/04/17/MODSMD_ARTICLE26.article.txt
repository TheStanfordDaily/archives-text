# Tribe Golfers Split A Pair
## 
### 
Coach Bud Finger's Indian
golfers opened Pacific-8 play in
great style last Friday, easily
defeating an outclassed Cal team
36 18.
Sophomore Tom Watson won
medalist honors with a fine 71,
finishing up with four straight 3's.
Watson came up with two birdies,
an eagle and a par on the final
four holes to edge Cal's Art
McNickel (who shot a 72) 4-2.
Jeff Blankenburg and Bob Riddell
both checked in with 74's for
Stanford, while Greg Pitzer shot a
75, Sandy Adelman a 76, and Ray
Isbell an 83.
Stanford outshot San Jose
State in both .4-man and total
team scores Monday afternoon,
but lost the match 14-13 when
the Spartans picked up crucial
points in the fourth and sixth
individual matches.
The Tribe's 4-man total was a
strong 282, compared with 292
for the Spartans. Soph sensation
Tom Watson led the way with a
68, followed by Greg Pitzer with a
69, Sandy Adelman with a 72,
and Jeff Blankenburg's 73.
San Jose's No. 1 and 2 men,
according to the team ladder, shot
75 and 78, enabling the Indians to
grab a big lead. But the Spartans
more than made up for that when
their next four players (ranked 3,
4, 5, and 6 on the ladder) all shot
73's. The Indians beat San Jose in
team score, 433 to 435, but lost
the match.
The Tribe freshman outstroked
West Valley College 21 , /a-B'/2 on
the Riverside Country Club
Course in Coyote. Zack Miller
paced the Indian effort with a fine
72.


WATSON WEDGE—Sensational sophomore Tom Watson has maintained his
position atop the varsity tennis ladder throughout the year with great efforts
like the 68 he turned in against San jose Monday.


STANFORD SANFORD—The sight of Allen Sanford hitting the tape first in the
mile is becoming a familiar sight to Stanford track and field fans. Sanford
recorded the fifth best time in Stanford history last week at UCLA, a brilliant
4:04.6.
