## Netmen Edge Cal In Thriller 
### 
Last Saturday, for the first
time in 1969, Coach Dick Could
hud his entire tennis team on the
court for a match. Plagued by
injuries, presidential campaigns,
and overseas study, Gould has
been forced to juggle his lineup
throughout the year. But the
Indians were ready last weekend,
and responded with hard-fought
5-4 win over a sophomore-studded
Cal team.
Junior John Spiegel and
sophomore Paul Marienthal each
played a part in two wins for the
Tribe. Spiegel, taking time off
from his campaign for student
body president, won the third
singles match over Cal senior Mike
Gilfillen is straight sets.
Marienthal, playing despite a
painful shoulder injury that
greatly hampers his serve, took
the fifth singles from Pete
Hoffman 7-5, 6-1. Chuck Alloo,
brother of Cal's No. 1 player Bob,

picked up Stanford's third point
in the sixth singles, tying things
up at 3-3 going into the doubles
competition.
Cal's Alloo-Gilfillen duo topped
Stanford's tandem of Alloo and
Stan Pasarell 10-8, 7-5 to give the
Bears at 4-3 edge. But Spiegel, a
Berkeley native, teamed with Rob
Rippner, who's just returned from
study in Europe, to win a thrilling
second doubles match over Cal's
Larry Parker and Mile Mullan,
11-9, 12*10.
With the match hanging in the
balance, Marie n thai and
Stanford's No. 1 man Dean
Schlobohm, hooked up with Cal's
Gary Hippensteil and Dixon
LeVant in a three-set battle for
the third doubles point. After
dropping the first set 4-6,
Schlobohm and Marienthal rallied
to win the final two 11-9 and 6-2,
to give Stanford the victory.
This weekend, once again the
Indians must .tangle with the
nation's two finest teams, UCLA
and USC. Two weeks ago the
Bruins whipped the Indians 6-0,
the Trojans following suit 7-2.
Last week the two Southern
powers collided, with UUSC
maintaining the No. 1 ranking in
the nation with a s'/2-3'/: win.

The Trojans have three Davis
Cuppersâ€”American Bob LuU and
Mexican natives Joaquin
Loyo-Mayo and Marcello Lara.
Former National Junior Champ
Steve Avoyer, and George Taylor,
who upset Lutz two weeks ago in
the Southern California
In tercollegiates, complete the
USC first five. Veterans Roy
Barth, Steve Tidball and Ron
Bornstead, plus soph sensation
Jeff Borowiak, pace the powerful
Bruin assembly.
The Indians, just beginning to
jell now that the entire team is
together and in one piece, will be
underdogs in both matches.
