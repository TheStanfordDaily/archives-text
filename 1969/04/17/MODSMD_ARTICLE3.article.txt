# Pitzer's Statement
## 
### 
The sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory is entering its eighth day.
My resolution has been to manage this
situation by appeal to the moral
commitment, to a free community of
learning. That commitment continues,
as it will continue no matter what
actions are taken, in the name of
morality, which actually threaten the
very existence of the university.
After twice notifying th ose
occupying the AEL that their acts
violated the Campus Disruption
Policy—a policy ratified by
representative Faculty and Student
bodies—an earnest effort was made to
allow those committing what seemed to
be an act of conscientious civil
disobedience to identify themselves.
Authorized faculty and staff persons
asked a large number of demonstrators
to give their names as violating campus
policies in the interest of a higher cause.
Instead of complying with
established procedures and obligations,
almost all the persons confronted defied
the interviewers. One interviewer, a
respected member of the faculty, was
told that if he returned to the scene of
the demonstration he would be bodily
attacked. Identification of violators

continues, and every effort will be made
to enable the judicial process accepted
by this university to function. Let
nobody think that his own moral
principles exempt him from the
accepted moral principles upon which
higher learning in this and all other
universities is founded.
Before the occupation of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory began, students
voted overwhelmingly not to cause
property damage and not to tamper
with classified files there. The
importance of these commitments
cannot be minimized.
The classified document files in the
AEL constitute a very special and
serious problem. The University has a
contractual obligation to safeguard
these files and, up to the present, we
have been able to persuade Federal
authorities that these documents are
protected. At the same time, we are
obligated to maintain continuing
consultation with the responsible
Federal security officer in this area.
Should the federal government find it
necessary to actively take over this
responsibility, clearly the community
will have lost, at least in part, control
over our own affairs.
Unfortunately there exists in certain
segments of the Stanford community an
impression that the demonstrators at
AEL are harmlessly focusing attention
on an otherwise neglected issue of
principle. In fact, the demonstration is
inherently an ugly, sometimes fierce
threat to and infringement upon the
rights of researchers to research,
students to study, and teachers to teach.
The guidelines governing research,
both within the University and at SRI,
are under serious and active study and
appropriate changes are in progress.
For my own part, I have left no
question that I believe the national
priorities must be adjusted to the
general welfare, and research on means
of destruction must yield to research on
the instruments of peace. These issues
are not under debate. The issue at hand
is whether Stanford shall live by
procedures of judicial due process upon
which all constituencies have agreed. My
staff and I are committed to the
principle that it shall.
