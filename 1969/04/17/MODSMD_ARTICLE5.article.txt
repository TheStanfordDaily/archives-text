# Constitution Approved
## Cory, Shea Win Primary Election 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Student body elections came to a
conclusion yesterday, masked from the
public's attention for the second spring
in a row by a sit-in, with the tickets of
Bob Cory and Pat Shea left in the ASSU
presidential race.
Denis Hayes' final attempt to pass a
new ASSU constitution ended in success
by an almost four-to-one margin.
Students by a vote of 2470 to 564
agreed to a smaller legislature, student

assessment of fees, and a committee on
nominations.
Bob Cory, a junior in political
science, and Eckhard Schulz, a graduate
student in electrical engineering,
outpolled all other candidates with
1055 votes.
The next closest challenger was the
"president's council" ticket of Pat Shea,
a junior in political science, John Grube,
a senior in political science, Joyce
Kobayashi, a junior in philosophy, and
Barry Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology. Their 808 votes are exclusive
of the overseas campus vote, which are
due Saturday.
Run-Off Election
The run-off election will be
scheduled for sometime next week,
according to Elections Commissioner
Bob Debs.
The results in the balloting for three
student members of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) will
not be known for some time. Voting
was on the Hare System, which requires

tallying by a computer.
Both of the remaining presidential
candidates hope to focus on issues in
the upcoming round of campaigning.
"We are going to concentrate on
personal contact," Cory insisted last
night. He and Schulz will continue their
campaign to reach those "tired of
nonrepresentative government."
Shea concurred with his opponent's
approach and added that he hopes to
wage a campaign "educationally
oriented towards problems'" of the
university.
"We will strive to convince the
student body that student government
must become an effective co-ordinating
unit to maintain the momentum of
strong student voice in university
affairs," Shea said.
Schulz concluded from election
returns that the student body holds no
clearly identifiable electoral blocks.
Other totals in the presidential race
were: Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane: 488;
Andrew Gould and Marc Heller: 85;

Paul Floto and Mike Roake: 15; Charles
B. Kitsman and Neil Heller: 32; Philip
Laird and John Thomas: 40; John L.

Schulz concluded from election
returns that the student body holds no
clearly identifiable electoral blocks.
Other totals in the presidential race
were: Tim Coburn and Jeff Kane: 488;
Andrew Gould and Marc Heller: 85;

Paul Floto and Mike Roake: 15; Charles
B. Kitsman and Neil Heller: 32; Philip
Laird and John Thomas: 40; John L.
King and William L. Ellsworth: 25;
Hughie Mac Donald and Bobby
Weisenberg: 24; Bob Mattson and Dick
Walker: 250; Jim Schnieder and A 1
Dulan: 469; John Spiegel and Brad
Cornell: 196; and Allan Wernick and
Lawrence Gamble: 62.
Student body elections came to a
conclusion yesterday, masked from the
public's attention for the second spring
in a row by a sit-in, with the tickets of
Bob Cory and Pat Shea left in the ASSU
presidential race.
Denis Hayes' final attempt to pass a
new ASSU constitution ended in success
by an almost four-to-one margin.
Students by a vote of 2470 to 564
agreed to a smaller legislature, student

assessment of fees, and a committee on
nominations.
Bob Cory, a junior in political
science, and Eckhard Schulz, a graduate
student in electrical engineering,
outpolled all other candidates with
1055 votes.
The next closest challenger was the
"president's council" ticket of Pat Shea,
a junior in political science, John Grube,
a senior in political science, Joyce
Kobayashi, a junior in philosophy, and
Barry Askinas, a graduate student in
sociology. Their 808 votes are exclusive
of the overseas campus vote, which are
due Saturday.
Run-Off Election
The run-off election will be
scheduled for sometime next week,
according to Elections Commissioner
Bob Debs.
The results in the balloting for three
student members of the Student
Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) will
not be known for some time. Voting
was on the Hare System, which requires

tallying by a computer.
Both of the remaining presidential
candidates hope to focus on issues in
the upcoming round of campaigning.
"We are going to concentrate on
personal contact," Cory insisted last
night. He and Schulz will continue their
campaign to reach those "tired of
nonrepresentative government."
Shea concurred with his opponent's
approach and added that he hopes to
wage a campaign "educationally
oriented towards problems'" of the
university.
"We will strive to convince the
student body that student government
must become an effective co-ordinating
unit to maintain the momentum of
strong student voice in university
affairs," Shea said.
Schulz concluded from election
returns that the student body holds no
clearly identifiable electoral blocks.
