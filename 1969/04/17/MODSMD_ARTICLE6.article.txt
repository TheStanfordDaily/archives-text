# SRI Questionnaire Sent To Community
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Students and faculty will be receiving
a questionnaire in the mail late this
week polling them "on issues in the
relationship between SRI and the
University."
The questionnaire comes soon after
President Pitzer ordered such a poll to
be taken April 10th, after the issuance
of the Stanford-SRI Study Committee
Report.
Poll Distribution
The poll is to be distributed with
return envelopes enclosed. Students and
faculty members are urged to return the
questionnaire no later than midnight
April 23.
According to Chairman Maccoby the
questionnaire is to be issued to the
student body via local mail
immediately.
The committee has been forced to
put together a set of questions in the
shortest possible time, since the release
of the Scott report.
"No! Happy"
Maccoby says that we "are not
completely happy with what we've
done. The issues involved are so
complex that to ask people to vote
without having informed themselves is
pretty bad."
Briefly the questions asked include:
With respect to the whole series of
issues concerning Stanford and SRI rank
the three most important issues in the
order of their importance to you."
Choices include:
Restricting certain types of research
done at SRI

Minimizing controls over research at
SRI
Separating SRI from the University
Integrating SRI into the University
Maximizing the increase in the
University's financial resources
Retaining SRl's flexible
not-for-profit status
Increasing the amount of socially
constructive research at SRI
Question B asks: "If SRI is retained
by the University, what research areas,
if any should be restricted?
Chemical warfare research
Biological warfare research
Radiological warfare research
Counter-insurgency research
Research related to the war in
Southeast Asia
Department of Defense research
Research that is classified in that
there are restrictions on publication
Research that is classified to allow
researchers access to secret material but
has no restrictions on publication
The third question deals specifically
with what research areas, if any, should be
restricted at SRI if sold.
