# Coalition Report Hits AEL Classified Work
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Coalition members occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL)
have released descriptions of six
classified projects being conducted at
AEL unearthed through their
examination of unclassified documents
in the building.
The report, "The Goods on AEL,"
describes work in six major areas, signal
receiving devices and techniques, data
processing and analysis, electronic
countermeasures, optical electronics,
electromagnetic propagation, and
general techniques, advanced research
and consultation.
Also discussed are the Baxter
Committee's (Committee on Research
Policy) published description of these
contracts and alterations of project
descriptions written by researchers by
their superiors in AEL.
The projects in question are all being
worked on at the Systems Techniques
Laboratory (STL), a part of AEL.
According to the report, "most of this
classified defense research is in the area
of what is known as electronic warfare.
Electronic warfare protects US
electronics from the incursions of the
enemy and attempts to deny the enemy
his electronic capability."
Classified Contracts
The classified contracts described
include:
1 ) F 3 3615-69-C-1414 or
AF33-615-3589, with Professor William
Rambo and Franklin M. Turner as the
principal investigators. The contract is
called "Researching Electromagnetic
Techniques" in the Baxter report.
Projects under the contract, sponsored
by the Air Force Avionics (Aviation
Electronics) Lab, include
"Radar-Emitter Location-Finding
Techniques," "Pattern Recognition of
Radar Signals," "Advanced Electrical
Engineering Research Applicable to
Countermeasures," "Advanced Systems
Techniques and Electron Devices
Applicable to Electronic
Countermeasures," and "Laser
Countermeasu res."
2) Nonr 225-59, with Rambo and
William May as principal investigators.
According to the Coalition report, the

contract includes "projects for detecting
'interpulse interval' radar ... and
'Range-Finding Direction-Finding'
receiver techniques to locate the
distance and direction of a radar
source," plus projects with applications
in radar jamming.
3) DAABO7-68-C-0149, which is the
contract described in the Baxter report
as ''Applied Research in
Electromagnetics," but actually has the
title of "Applied Research in Electronic
Warfare Techniques." One project
"deals with classification of radar signals
intercepted," according to the report,
and the purpose of another "is to test
critical hypotheses related to the threat
of a general battle situation."
4) N00123-69-C-1406, with Rambo
as chief Investigator, is titled "Study of
Quiet Electromagnetic Signals," and is
''apparently directed toward
intercepting secret communications
transmitted over a wide range of
frequencies," the Coalition report
noted.
5) F04701-68-0110, has as its
general purpose "the development of
electronic circuits for missile systems."
6) DAABO7-69-C-0081 "allows
three engineers ... to go to the USA
Electronic Proving Ground at Ft.
Huachuca, Arizona, to test a Microwave
Microscan Receiver developed under
another AEL contract which has since
expired," the report says.
'Deeply Involved'
The report concludes that "clearly,
the AEL is deeply involved in electronic
warfare. Those who work there have
been aware of this, and have known that
the Stanford community would find
this kind of war research repugnant . . .
"In addition to discussing sit-ins,
AEL staff have tried to prevent them
along with all other reformist measures
by limiting the public information
released to purely general and theoretic
formulations, and by deleting all
references to the specific military."
The report includes a working paper
by lab assistants Herman F. Schmid and
Raymond Black Jr. which had been
edited by Frank M, Turner to remove all
references to military applications,
especially electronic countermeasures.
