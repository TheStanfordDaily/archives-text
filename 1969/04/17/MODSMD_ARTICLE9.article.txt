• Research Policy
Editor, THE DAILY:
WE, THE RESIDENTS OF
MADERA HOUSE, support the
demands of the April 3rd
Coalition, that "military research
in the areas of counterinsurgency,
chemical and biological warfare,
war efforts in Southeast Asia and
classified research, be stopped and
that the Trustees hold a
decision-making meeting on these
issues open to the entire
community."
We urge the Board of Trustees
to take positive action on these
demands within the month of
April.
Furthermore, we urge the
university to assume tighter
control of SRI and that amnesty
be granted to the participants of
the sit-in.
It is our hope through the
implementation of these demands
to redirect SRI and other
University research towards the
alleviation of the suffering and
pain of the people of the world.

Editor, THE DAILY:
This is a personal message to
you, all Stanford Students,
University Administrators, the
Faculty, and the Board of

Regents. This is to express my
views on the continuing need for
Reserve Officers Training in our
Universities; I ask for the support
of all loyal Stanford Men—loyal
Americans, for this proven
program—an honorable tradition.
It deserves full academic standing.
Our national security is at
stake every day. It has been that
way since 1776 when our
Declaration of Independence was
signed. We have always been a
nation of Godfearing
"minutemen" and we must remain
prepared with adequate
defense—with well trained
intelligent armed forces.
Thousands of our finest officers
come from the ROTC programs
throughout our land. To remain
world leaders and to accomplish
our high world-wide goals we
must devote time and substance
to defense efforts.
Can it be that we have grown
soft? Can it be that our Stanford
Man of today does not work his
way, pay his way, or appreciate
the privilege of being a Stanford
Man? Can it be that he is not
aware of the struggle his father
went through to remain in
Stanford through a disasterous
depression? Can it be that he
could not enjoy the benefits of
higher education and academic
freedom at Stanford were it not
for the perseverance of his
parents —many of them
"depression babies"—many of

them volunteers in the battles of
WW 11. Can it be that more of you
future leaders of our nation
should be courteous to our local
and national leaders and rather be
using your energies directly on
relief of social problems and on
many other national and world
missions? Can it be that you
should be for many of our great
projects and institutions rather
than against so many of
them—this includes ROTC and
other military preparedness
programs.
It was only yesterday when I
was a struggling engineering
student, proud to wear Stanford's
colors on the boxing team and
later, proud to wear the uniform
of the United States Navy in WW
II combat and until now in its
Reserves. I strongly believe that I
may have earned the privilege to
assert myself. I strongly urge each
of you to join the rest of us who
are positive and affirmative —who
are for our time proved ROTC
program —Stan ford's own
contribution to national defense,
without which academic freedom
will die along with our beloved
nation.

Declaration of Independence was
signed. We have always been a
nation of Godfearing
"minutemen" and we must remain
prepared with adequate
defense—with well trained
intelligent armed forces.
Thousands of our finest officers
come from the ROTC programs
throughout our land. To remain
world leaders and to accomplish
our high world-wide goals we
must devote time and substance
to defense efforts.
Can it be that we have grown
soft? Can it be that our Stanford
Man of today does not work his
way, pay his way, or appreciate
the privilege of being a Stanford
Man? Can it be that he is not
aware of the struggle his father
went through to remain in
Stanford through a disasterous
depression? Can it be that he
could not enjoy the benefits of
higher education and academic
freedom at Stanford were it not
for the perseverance of his
parents —many of them
"depression babies"—many of

them volunteers in the battles of
WW 11. Can it be that more of you
future leaders of our nation
should be courteous to our local
and national leaders and rather be
using your energies directly on
relief of social problems and on
many other national and world
missions? Can it be that you
should be for many of our great
projects and institutions rather
than against so many of
them—this includes ROTC and
other military preparedness
programs.
It was only yesterday when I
was a struggling engineering
student, proud to wear Stanford's
colors on the boxing team and
later, proud to wear the uniform
of the United States Navy in WW
II combat and until now in its
Reserves. I strongly believe that I
may have earned the privilege to
assert myself. I strongly urge each
of you to join the rest of us who
are positive and affirmative —who
are for our time proved ROTC
program —Stan ford's own
contribution to national defense,
without which academic freedom
will die along with our beloved
nation.

WE, THE RESIDENTS OF
MADERA HOUSE, support the
demands of the April 3rd
Coalition, that "military research
in the areas of counterinsurgency,
chemical and biological warfare,
war efforts in Southeast Asia and
classified research, be stopped and
that the Trustees hold a
decision-making meeting on these
issues open to the entire
community."
We urge the Board of Trustees
to take positive action on these
demands within the month of
April.
Furthermore, we urge the
university to assume tighter
control of SRI and that amnesty
be granted to the participants of
the sit-in.
It is our hope through the
implementation of these demands
to redirect SRI and other
University research towards the
alleviation of the suffering and
pain of the people of the world.

This is a personal message to
you, all Stanford Students,
University Administrators, the
Faculty, and the Board of

Regents. This is to express my
views on the continuing need for
Reserve Officers Training in our
Universities; I ask for the support
of all loyal Stanford Men—loyal
Americans, for this proven
program—an honorable tradition.
It deserves full academic standing.
Our national security is at
stake every day. It has been that
way since 1776 when our
Declaration of Independence was
signed. We have always been a
nation of Godfearing
"minutemen" and we must remain
prepared with adequate
