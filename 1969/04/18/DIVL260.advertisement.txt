Eve's wardrobe costs a lit
tle more these days—a factor
that bears directly on every
young husband's financial
security. True, you may not
be a young husband. Vet. Sta
tistically, however, the odds
are heavily against the per
manency of that condition.
And it's smart to plan now—
before the wife and family
make the scene.
Here's one way. Invest in a
life insurance program that
can provide the foundation for
a solid financial structure.
Remember, the earlier you
start, the less coverage costs,
and the more security you'll
have a chance to build.
So phone our office today.
Or stop by and let's talk about
it. In the meantime give a
thought to the figleaf—and
how comfortable it feels to
be covered
