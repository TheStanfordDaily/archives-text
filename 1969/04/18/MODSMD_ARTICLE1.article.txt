# SJC Grants Pitzer 'Emergency Powers' Academic Council Meeting Called For 11
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Stanford plunged toward intense
crisis last night as the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) recommended that
President Kenneth Pitzer utilize
emergency powers to end the eight day
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL).
Pitzer has called a special meeting of
the Academic Council today at 11 a.m.
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium to report on
the recommendation. He does not plan
to take any action prior to the faculty
meeting.
Classes taught by Academic Council
members (assistant professor and above)
are cancelled at 11 a.m.
The SJC unanimously found that the
AEL sit-in was a disruption involving
"extraordinary circumstances,"
permitting presidential use of
emergency powers granted under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
Immediate Action
In a 5 to 2 vote, the Council
suggested the president take immediate
action to end the sit-in by declaring the
AEL and surrounding areas "closed" to
all persons for a week, starting at noon
Friday, April 18.

Any student remaining in the area
would face immediate temporary
suspension until a hearing of his case by
the Council.
Faculty and staff members would
face immediate temporary suspension of
pay, not to exceed 25 per cent of a
year's pay.
The SJC majority further
recommended that Pitzer seek a civil
injunction to prohibit disruption by
demonstrators not subject to University
jurisdiction. Should this prove
unworkable, the SJC suggested the
president consult with the Santa Clara
district attorney to institute appropriate
criminal action.
Informed sources said last night that
Pitzer will probably implement the SJC
recommendations today in hopes of
ending the sit-in by internal University
means and avoid outside police or
federal action.
In discussions yesterday, members of
the Stanford administration presented
three alternatives facing the president:
end the sit-in by internal methods, use
outside force to clear the AEL, or close
down the University.
The administration, it is reported,

apparently desires to avoid police use
believing it would split the campus and
create havoc. Pitzer, therefore, would
evidently prefer to close the University,
should the sit-in continue despite use of
his emergency powers.
In the unanimous finding of the SJC
decision, the Council states that
occupation of AEL constitutes "a
disruption of an 'approved activity' of
the University under the policy on
Campus Disruption."
The Council then cites seven points
which involve "extraordinary
circumstances" about the
demonstration. The points follow:
•"There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
• "There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
• "There is serious danger that certain
individuals or groups of individuals will
attempt to retaliate with force against
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory.

• "A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
• "Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
• "Persons engaged in the occupation
have refused to cooperate with the
Stanford Judicial Council by voting not
to send a representative to participate in
these hearings.
• "The occupation has lasted for
seven full days and the time of
voluntary termination cannot be
ascertained."
SJC Majority Report
The majority report ot SJC on
"Holdings" recommends specific actions
Pitzer should take to end the sit-in.
These include the closing of AEL and
surrounding area today at noon "to all
persons except those specifically
appointed by the President solely lor
the purpose of maintaining security of
the premises."
AEL, according to the Council
majority, should be reopened on briday
April 25, "to personnel and only to
personnel having pertinent business
therein."
While recommending temporary
suspensions for student and pay cuts for

faculty, the Council states such
sanctions will only be imposed until the
SJC or another "appropriate tribunal
having jurisdiction" holds a hearing.
Hearings will be granted on request, and
"priority will be given to all cases in
which the person's requesting a hearing
appends a letter certifying that he in no
way violated either provision (a) or
(b)," (that he did not disrupt AEL
during the week it was closed and when
it reopens.)
The majority decision recommends
that during the remainder of the
academic quarter Pitzer may use his
emergency powers if similar
circumstances exist at another
demonstration.
The majority report was signed by
three faculty members and two
students.
Dissenting Decision
A dissenting decision, signed by two
student members of the SJC states:
"Even if the Council determines that
extraordinary circumstances exist,
however, it may not, consistent with the
Charter, make recommendations to the
President to impose sanctions on
individuals without a prior hearing. An
important reason for the promulgation
of the Charter last spring was to protect
students in political cases such as this
one.
"In any student disciplinary case, the

full extent of the Council's power is to
make recommendations to the
President. In effect, the Council has
decided to make recommendations
without either individual hearings or the
guarantees of defendant rights at those
hearings."
The AEL sit-in continued through
the night, entering its ninth day today.
The April 3 Coalition held a noon rally
in White Plaza yesterday and met last
night to discuss plans for attending the
general meeting of the student body
today at 1 p.m. in Frost Amphitheater.
Yesterday afternoon's scheduled
joint meeting of the Student Education
Council and the Academic Senate was
adjourned for consideration of research
at Stanford and the tactics of the
current sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory.
Under criticism from several students
that the faculty had failed to take
action pertaining to the Coalition
demands, Prof. Leonard Schiff,
chairman of the Academic Senate,
insisted the action of that group
Tuesday night was a "very decisive
one."
"What we established were new
research policy guidelines that would
make it impossible to have secret
research," he said.


THE EIGHTH DAY—The sit-in at the Applied Electronics Laboratory moved into its eighth day yesterday and students met
once again in the courtyard. There will be another meeting today at noon at AEL.
