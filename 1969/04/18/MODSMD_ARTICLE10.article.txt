## Focus On SRI 
### Dave Pugh 
Now that there is a possibility
that the faculty will halt
on-campus war research next
week, we must focus our
attention and action on SRI once
again. The SRI Committee Report
as a whole has helped clarify the
alternatives (basically severance
with a covenant vs closer control
of SRI and encouraging socially
constructive research). But the
Majority Report obscures the
fundamental moral and political
issues in a swkmp of legalistic
arguments which are themselves
of dubious value.
Briefly, the Majority Report
proposes to divest the University
of SRI over a period of 20 years,
during which time Stanford would
presumably restrict CBW,
c o un t e r in su r g en c y , and
Vi e t n a m - r e 1 a t e d research
(classified research is ignored) by
means of a restrictive covenant.
This plan is very attractive on
the surface, since it allows us to
take a moral stand on war
research, pull in close to $2
million each year from the
divestiture, and wash our hands of
the "SRI problem," both
administratively and
psychologically.
Leaving aside the primary
political points for the time being,
the Majority Report's plan has
major legal difficulties. The first
problem lies in the fact that a
restrictive covenant would
decrease- the market value of SRI
considerably. As a non-profit
institution which the courts are
supposed to "protect," Stanford
could very well face a suit brought
by the Attorney General to force
the University to sell SRI without
a restrictive covenant to a higher
bidder e.g. Litton Industries.
A second major problem is that
there is no legal precedent for
enforcing a morally-grounded
covenant. The courts generally
only enforce convenants
protecting a creditor's investment
or profit margin in a corporate
enterprise. Thus, the State
judiciary could very well strike
down the Majority Report's
proposed covenant on the grounds
that it is non-financial and
opposes "public policy."
We might also ask if we should
rely on the Stanford trustees to

bring suit against SRI in case the
covenant were breached. But even
if the trustees were to delegate
legal responsibility for bringing
suit against SRI to a
student-faculty board, the fact
remains that litigation would be a
long, drawn-out process.
Furthermore, obtaining an
injunction against war research
during litigation would not be
easy—-SRl's military research
might go on for years while suits,
appeals, and more appeals were
processed by the courts. Very
importantly, any drawn-out
litigation would make it
extremely difficult to maintain
any effective community pressure
on SRI.
Operating on the
unsubstantiated assumption that a
covenant can be enforced, the
Majority Report's constant
emphasis on Stanford's potential
financial gain and administrative
convenience is dismaying.
Radicals are often baited for
lacking plans for social
reconstruction—the Majority
Report substitutes an ivory tower
argument when faced with such
plans.
For contrast, the Minority
Report of the SRI Committee
points out very clearly that a
combination of closer
University-SRI staff-community
control and guidance of SRl's
research would direct creative
energy away from needless court
battles into grappling with the
challenge of encouraging new
applied research on critical social
and economic problems at SRI.
Political Reason
There is a final important
political reason for bringing SRI
under closer University-commun
ity control. Severance would
reduce the political visibility of
SRI and the whole Midpeninsula
defense complex to the Stanford
community. With major elements
in the Stanford Electronics Labs
and Business School, SRI, and
surrounding defense-oriented
corporations, the Stanford
defense complex is rivalled in size
only by the Harvard-MIT-Route
128 companies research and
industrial complex.
The primary question is
whether we treat our opposition
to Stanford and SRl's war
research as a strictly one-shot
affair, or as a first step toward
reorienting the whole Stanford
defense complex towards socially
constructive work. If speeches
about "reordering national
priorities" are to be more than
flight rhetoric, Stanford students
and faculty will have to confront
much more directly, and for a
longer period of time than a sit-in,
their moral and social
responsibility to stop death
research at its local roots.
The question is whether
students and faculty at Stanford
and other defense universities will
accept their moral and social
responsibility to oppose military
research wherever it goes on. The
Vietnamese and Thais expect at
least that much from us.

much more directly, and for a
longer period of time than a sit-in,
their moral and social
responsibility to stop death
research at its local roots.
The question is whether
students and faculty at Stanford
and other defense universities will
accept their moral and social
responsibility to oppose military
research wherever it goes on. The
Vietnamese and Thais expect at
least that much from us.
(Dave Pugh is a junior and a
member of SDS—Ed.)
Now that there is a possibility
that the faculty will halt
on-campus war research next
week, we must focus our
attention and action on SRI once
again. The SRI Committee Report
as a whole has helped clarify the
alternatives (basically severance
with a covenant vs closer control
of SRI and encouraging socially
constructive research). But the
Majority Report obscures the
fundamental moral and political
issues in a swkmp of legalistic
arguments which are themselves
of dubious value.
Briefly, the Majority Report
proposes to divest the University
of SRI over a period of 20 years,
during which time Stanford would
presumably restrict CBW,
c o un t e r in su r g en c y , and
Vi e t n a m - r e 1 a t e d research
(classified research is ignored) by
means of a restrictive covenant.
This plan is very attractive on
the surface, since it allows us to
take a moral stand on war
research, pull in close to $2
million each year from the
divestiture, and wash our hands of
the "SRI problem," both
administratively and
psychologically.
Leaving aside the primary
political points for the time being,
the Majority Report's plan has
major legal difficulties. The first
problem lies in the fact that a
restrictive covenant would
decrease- the market value of SRI
considerably. As a non-profit
institution which the courts are
supposed to "protect," Stanford
could very well face a suit brought
by the Attorney General to force
the University to sell SRI without
a restrictive covenant to a higher
bidder e.g. Litton Industries.
A second major problem is that
there is no legal precedent for
enforcing a morally-grounded
covenant. The courts generally
only enforce convenants
protecting a creditor's investment
or profit margin in a corporate
enterprise. Thus, the State
judiciary could very well strike
down the Majority Report's
proposed covenant on the grounds
that it is non-financial and
opposes "public policy."
We might also ask if we should
rely on the Stanford trustees to

bring suit against SRI in case the
covenant were breached. But even
if the trustees were to delegate
legal responsibility for bringing
suit against SRI to a
student-faculty board, the fact
remains that litigation would be a
long, drawn-out process.
Furthermore, obtaining an
injunction against war research
during litigation would not be
easy—-SRl's military research
might go on for years while suits,
appeals, and more appeals were
processed by the courts. Very
importantly, any drawn-out
litigation would make it
extremely difficult to maintain
any effective community pressure
on SRI.
Operating on the
unsubstantiated assumption that a
covenant can be enforced, the
Majority Report's constant
emphasis on Stanford's potential
financial gain and administrative
convenience is dismaying.
Radicals are often baited for
lacking plans for social
reconstruction—the Majority
Report substitutes an ivory tower
argument when faced with such
plans.
For contrast, the Minority
Report of the SRI Committee
points out very clearly that a
combination of closer
University-SRI staff-community
control and guidance of SRl's
research would direct creative
energy away from needless court
battles into grappling with the
challenge of encouraging new
applied research on critical social
and economic problems at SRI.
Political Reason
There is a final important
political reason for bringing SRI
under closer University-commun
ity control. Severance would
reduce the political visibility of
SRI and the whole Midpeninsula
defense complex to the Stanford
community. With major elements
in the Stanford Electronics Labs
and Business School, SRI, and
surrounding defense-oriented
corporations, the Stanford
defense complex is rivalled in size
only by the Harvard-MIT-Route
128 companies research and
industrial complex.
The primary question is
whether we treat our opposition
to Stanford and SRl's war
research as a strictly one-shot
affair, or as a first step toward
reorienting the whole Stanford
defense complex towards socially
constructive work. If speeches
about "reordering national
priorities" are to be more than
flight rhetoric, Stanford students
and faculty will have to confront
much more directly, and for a
longer period of time than a sit-in,

128 companies research and
industrial complex.
The primary question is
whether we treat our opposition
to Stanford and SRl's war
research as a strictly one-shot
affair, or as a first step toward
reorienting the whole Stanford
defense complex towards socially
constructive work. If speeches
about "reordering national
priorities" are to be more than
flight rhetoric, Stanford students
and faculty will have to confront
much more directly, and for a
longer period of time than a sit-in,
their moral and social
responsibility to stop death
research at its local roots.
The question is whether
students and faculty at Stanford
and other defense universities will
accept their moral and social
responsibility to oppose military
research wherever it goes on. The
Vietnamese and Thais expect at
least that much from us.
