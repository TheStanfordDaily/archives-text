## Goals, Tactics Inseparable 
### C.H. Divine 
I'm afraid Molly Dougherty's
article "Power and a Better
World" in Thursday's Daily is a
poor analysis of those who
support the goals of the Coalition
but oppose their tactics. She is
claiming to explain the
motivations of a very large
segment of this university in, to
say the least, a very simplistic
manner.
It would seem that all of us
who despise war, exploitation,
oppression, etc., but who don't
join the illegal sit-in are merely
afraid to admit how powerless we
really are, and furthermore, we
are supporting the System because
we know that one day we will
inherit its power.
Well, I won't claim to represent
all the other students who have
rejected coercive tactics, but I will
speak for myself.
Miss Dougherty states correctly
that goals and tactics are
inseparable. In fact, this is
precisely why I can't support the
Coalition's actions. When I see the
tactics contradicting the goals I
begin looking for a different horse
to ride.
On the one hand we're told
that the goal is the elimination of
inhumane acts against mankind,
e.g. killing, oppression,
exploitation, etc.
On the other hand we have the
tactics being used to achieve this
worthwhile goal, e.g. invasion of
personal privacy, violation of the
express will of the people
(according to two elections) by
illegally disrupting the university,
violent diatribes against the
students and faculty who don't
agree, personal threats to students
trying to use their own
laboratories (Mr. Sawchuck), and
"participatory democracy" in
which those who do not share the
sit-inners' political bent are asked
not to vote.
Yes, Molly, goals and tactics
are inseparable. You preach
concern for fellow humans-show
me in your dealings with the

students trying to conduct
research in AEL. You say there is
too much power in too few
hands—show me by abiding by the
will of the university, which you
claim to represent. You preach
LOVE, not hate—show me by the
way you treat me and the others
who don't agree with everything
you do.
Why You?
My question is this: "Why
should I trust the fate of the
oppressed peoples of the world
with you, when the only evidence
I have on which to judge you
indicates that you really don't
believe, or at best understand, the
principles you preach?"
But of course the answer is:
"The little harm we may do now
is so slight compared to the evil
prepetrated by the Trustees that it
shouldn't even be mentioned in
the same breath. We are only
using these means to obtain a
POWER BASE. Once we are
strong we can show the world
what true MORALITY is."
Let me quote a man who was
not exactly considered
"establishment" in his time. "A
healthy tree does not bear bad
fruit, nor does a poor tree bear
good fruit. Every tree is known by
the fruit it bears; you do not pick
figs from thorn bushes, or gather
grapes from bramble bushes."
This sandaled, bearded
itinerant could hardly be accused
of oppressing the poor or
pandering to the System. If you
doubt it, check the record. But he
had a worldview distinctly
different, from distinctly different
from that of the Coalition.
He believed that morality was a
personal problem. Groups,
governments, systems, etc. were
not immoral—people were. When
the people start living
God-directed lives the groups they
form will be moral. His message
was always personal.
My responsibility is first to my
own total (as opposed to
selective) morality—then to my

brother's. "How can you say to
your brother, 'Please brother, let
me take that speck out of your
eye,' yet not even see the log in
your own eye? You imposter!
Take the log out of your own eye
first, and then you will be able to
see and take the speck out of your
brother's eye."
No, Molly, I don't "believe it is
not possible to build a world of
equal opportunity for creative
fulfillment." On the contrary, the
capenter had a lot to say about
justice, equality and the
"abundant life"—and he showed
us the way.
But then why should we listen
to him ... he was not "effective."
