## Appalled At SRI Questionnaire 
### 
Fditor, THE DAILY:
When I read the article on the
SRI questionnaire in Thursday's
Daily I was appalled. With minor
effort I obtained a copy of the
questionnaire itself. I found that
the worst is true.
First, I read I was to "rank the
three most important issues," in
order of their importance to me.
So I read on through the list of
"important issues" from which I
was to choose, only to find that
the issue which I and a number of
others on the SRI Committee see
as most important is not even
stated. As the majority report of
the Committee insists, anyone
favoring holding on to SRI and
trying to run it simply must, if he
is morally responsible, face this
simple question: Who will pay
what this course is likely to cost?
An SRI with drastically altered
research priorities is going to run
deficits which could dwarf the
University's operating deficit this
year, and Stanford as legal owner
is going to be liable.
Part A of the questionnaire
should have contained the option
"Avoiding unacceptable financial
risks to the University" or,
"Avoiding impossible burdens on
the University's resources." This
in my judgment is the decisive
case against retention and
"reform." For the questionaire
not even to recognize this issue is
shocking.
I protest also the manner of
those references to financial
considerations which do occur
throughout the questionnaire. We
are given the impression that we
are asked to choose between
moral action and grabbing more
money.
This is absurd. Both the
majority report and the separate
statement by Mr. Scott and Mr.
Lyman stress the many possible
socially constructive things
Stanford could do with funds that
divestment of SRI could bring in.
How many have read these
parts of the report? For that
matter, how many of us have read
the whole report, and not just the
part of it conforming to our own
prejudgments of the issue?
Perhaps this very question could
have been on the questionaire. It
might have suggested to some

respondents that a part of their
moral duty (something we are
hearing much of now) is to read
the report through and to think
carefully about all sides of this
complex problem before coming
to a decision.
Finally it is merely
symptomatic of the impulsive
haste in which this issue is being
approached that the third
alternative listed in the last part of
the quetionnaire is so garbled that
it is completely misleading.
Returning to Part A again, are the
"issues" we choose things we are
against or things we are for? It is
clear on reflection they must be
things we are for. But a tight
unambiguous questionnaire
should have said so.
These are not substantive
defects. But the questionnaire's
failure to represent the issues fully
and fairly are substantive defects,
and they make it highly
tendentious. It ought to be
redone.

• SCLC Power
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Judicial Charter clearly
gives the Student Conduct
Legislative Council the authority
to legislate in all areas of student
conduct including the power to
state "that specified forms of
non-academic conduct are not the
proper subject of University
control." Mr. Friedenthal's
protests notwithstanding, the
SCLC did just that.
The SCLC made it clear that
they believed that they were
doing nothing more than using
their authority over student
disciplinary matters to "amplify
and clarify" the charter.
It has become all too clear that
Friedenthal's actions and
statements arise from one of two
possibilities—either he does not
understand the Charter under
which he operates or he does
understand but deliberately
wishes to disregard the Charter
and the rights it gives to students.
I am asking students and
faculty to ignore all actibns and

pronouncements of the Judicial
Council until such time as the
Council stops the abuses of its
authority by its chairman or until
the chairman stops acting in such
a cavalier fashion.

• Omission
Editor, THE DAILY:
In your report of Wednesday,
April 16, 1969 on the Senate
meeting of Tuesday April 15,
1969, you omitted one fact which

I believe deserves wider
circulation. This is the answer of
Earl G. L. Cilley, Research
Administrator for the University
to a question which I asked of
him. The question was whether
there is any chemical, biological
or radiological warfare research or
counter-insurgency research
currently being conducted at
Stanford University. His answer
was that as he understood the
words to be commonly used,
there is none.
