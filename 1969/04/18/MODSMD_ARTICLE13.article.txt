# Four Faces Of Blackness
## 
### R.E. GRANT 
Four Faces/sure . . .Four
Faces of Blackness/Or so they
believe them to be: God, Orgasm,
Loneliness and Death ... A weird,
funny, strange experience of hard
Black human Beauty ("I heard
someone say that it's like being
tore up high running thru a
staircase of dreams .... and
something more . . . something I
have to find again for
myself . . . (laughter).
Yet Fourth Stream Expression
is a group of students, artists and
the rest, from Chicago, back East,
and other points West. But again
this wasn't just another "student
show," that is, with the visional
music of "Smoke," the
photography of Ira Kahn and the
words of several sensitive Black

people an experience was
carefully woven as sure as the
ironic ends of all your dream
realities.
We heard that after the second
performance most of the audience
placed their mind's eye in a safe
pocket walking away in
silence/some to think/some to
feel/and some to realize that a
great distance from God to Death
and back again had been traversed
in very little time/TIME? Tell me
where is your face?
. . . And this will happen again.
An hour of your time this coming
Saturday night at 7:15 and 9:15
p.m. in Dinkeltipie! Auditorium.
Check yourself 2nd Lalk deep with
Mary Hane before you visit
yourself: God, Orgasm,
Loneliness, and Death.
