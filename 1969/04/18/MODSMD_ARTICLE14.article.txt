## Cosmic Consciousness 
### Johnie Scott 
One can look forward to a
jumping in cosmic consciousness
with the coming this Sunday,
April 20th, of avant-garde Sun-Ra
and his Myth-Science Arkestra at
Dinkelspiel as Stanford's BSU
closes out its Afro-American
Week.
You can easily get stumped for
words in trying to relate what
Sun-Ra is all about to the
uninitiated. There are those who
feel that to call his music
"avant-garde" is to miss the real
flavor of the Arkestra (the only
big band in the field of Space
Music).
The musicians, all of them
young except for Sun-Ra (who
has been playing "his" music for
the past 20 years), hail from the
New York area. Its tough spots
(e.g., Bed ford-Stuy vestant,
Harlem, Brooklyn, the outer areas
as well, like Newark). Their entire
musical review, extensions of the
unself-conscious, is arranged in
layers of rhythmic effects.
Dressed in spacegarb, the
Myth-Science Arkestra (a take-off
on Noah's Ark, the vessel that
carried pure life to future
existence after the wrath of God
had descended with The Flood)
enters amidst a swirl of colors,
1 i gh t-ef fects (Sun-Ra was
"dabbling" with the concepts now
embodied in light-shows ten years
before light shows became cliche)
and screams.
It is a fantastic group and the
history of Sun-Ra speaks as much
for its influence on other
musiciansâ€”John Coltrane came up
in the tradition of the Arkestra,

Cecil Taylor refers many times to
the a 11 - p e r v a d in g socio
p sy chological dynamic of
"Sunny" (as intimates refer to the
man who plays, at various times
and then, again, at the same time,
the electric piano, organ, piano,
harpsichord beneath his burning
sphere of light, the Sun), Pharoh
Sanders and Albert Ayler, Ornette
Coleman and Archie Shepp,
Marion Brown and Sunny Murray,
all of these, the frontrunners in
the forging of "The New Music"
speak of Sun-Ra in hushed,
reverent tones.
There is adequate reason. At
Princeton University when Sun-Ra
came to play, his effect was so
musically profound and
awe-inspiring until, came
intermission, half of the audience
was trampling their way towards
the ticket-booth demanding
refunds (shades of when
Stravinsky first opened "The
Rites of Spring" in London,
where the orchestra had to up and
run so incensed had the audience
become when confronted with
this entirely different concept in
music!).
Make no mistake with Sun-Ra!
The effect he will have on you
will be tremendous. Cecil Taylor,
last year, with a five-piece unit,
elicited streams of response.
Sun-Ra has a group that he refers
to at times as well as his "Solar r
Arkestra" which has all the effect
of twenty Coltranes, or four
Taylor units, all of these going in
their own directions, but all of
them under the control and
energy of one man, Sun-Ra (the
Sun-God, the Egyptian deity of

light/energy/potential/
fulfillment).
Comparing Sun-Ra, in fact, to
other musicians, is to do both him
and the Arkestra, much less those
other musicians, great disservice.
Let it be enough to note that a
revolutionary wave of creative
activities is sweeping through the
range of musical possibilities, and
that Sun-Ra with his
Myth-Science Arkestra, are at the
head of it. This Sunday afternoon,
at 2:30 p.m., they will be visible
as Dinkelspiel very well may feel
the first tremblings of the Great
Quake.
It is a music that all should
listen to, that all peoples should
reach out for. It is a difficult
music, it is harsh and it is
frightening. But it is a music that
is full of love as well. And it is a
music that signals the promise of
saving America, if this corrupt and
dying bitch deserves the beauty of
being saved. Come join the
movement is all that I can/will
save for my last breath, as
tomorrow promises to be the
future that we all want and must
have for ourselves now. If you
miss him, well!, you missed Big
Black, Oscar Brown Jr., Cecil
Taylor, Ornette Coleman and ever
so many others (and the world
will not wait for you forever).
