# British Campus Moves
## Students Occupy New Home 
### JAMES PERLOFF 
Daily Foreign Correspondent
Stanford-in-Britain moved into
its new home at Cliveden House
last week and in the process
overwhelmed the 80 students
completing their six months of
study in England.
The students were stunned by
the magnificience of their new
home and its grounds. Set about a

quarter of a milt- from the Thames
River in a formal English park, the
house moved even the most blase
students.
Part of the house's attraction is
its setting, part is its facilities. The
facilities include a heated
swimming pool, a tennis court, a
cricket pitch, and acres of grassy
lawn to lie on studying. The
students made good use of the
lawn during the first week
enjoying the sun and the
surroundings.
Opulence
"I think iLs really hard to
figure out what to do with all this
opulence. Its something we can
use or something which can
dominate us," commented
Sophomore Tony Sawtell.
The move to their new home
was surprisingly easy for the
students returning from their
three week break. It wasn't so
easy however for the
administration of
Stanford-in-Britain however. .
It took three weeks to move
the entire campus from
Grantham, and that entailed much
detailed planning. Seven large
moving vans moved all the
furniture south from Grantham.
Once the furniture arrived it had
to be directed to the numerous
rooms and storerooms. This
turned out to be the largest part
of the job.
Workmen had been renovating
the house since early January. The
most difficult tasks were to install
central heating and modern
plumbing in only throe months
time.
The reason for the move is
simple and similar to the reason
for the Austrian campus's move to
Vienna: Harlaxton manor was just
too far from London.
Too Remote
"We were too remote, too far
from London, and it was just too
expensive to get to London,"
explained George Docker, director
of admini. ration for the English
campus. Train fare from
Grantham to London was $3.60
one way, compared to the $.84
fare from Maidenhead to London.
Docker continued, "It
happened to be available at the
time we were looking, it was big
enough, and it was near London,
London Airport, and Oxford."
Cliveden House is one of the
most famous great houses in
Britain. Home of the Astor
family, it was the meeting set of
the famed "Cliveden Set" during
the 1930's which is alleged to
have included some of the most
powerful men in Britain and to
have engineered Britain's
appeasement policy towards
Hitler's Germany.
It was also one of the main
sites of the "Profumo Scandal" in
the early 1960'5. It was at
Cliveden that Defense Minister
John Profumo met Christine
Keeler, setting off one of the
greatest sex scandals of the
decade.
Gathering Ground
The house was famous before
the Profumo scandal as one of the
major gathering places for English
royality and peerage. Queen
Elizabeth is said to have been a

frequent visitor to the house
before the Profumo affair
The house is now owned by
the National Trust, a government
agency charged with preserving
historic homes. Stanford leases
the house on 21 year lease at
$6000 a year. The lease has
breakoff clauses at seven and 14
years.
The local newspapers have
given the group a warm reception.
The "Maidenhead Advertiser" ran
a report from one of its former
reporters now in America
reassuring its readers that
Stanford students are quite pacific
and nothing like the violent
revolutionaries at San Francisco
State and Berkeley, The article
referred to the fact that "Stanford
prides itself us being a training
ground for most of America's
business tycoons," that students
behave quite rationally, as befits
future businessmen.

The students were stunned by
the magnificience of their new
home and its grounds. Set about a

quarter of a milt- from the Thames
River in a formal English park, the
house moved even the most blase
students.
Part of the house's attraction is
its setting, part is its facilities. The
facilities include a heated
swimming pool, a tennis court, a
cricket pitch, and acres of grassy
lawn to lie on studying. The
students made good use of the
lawn during the first week
enjoying the sun and the
surroundings.
Opulence
"I think iLs really hard to
figure out what to do with all this
opulence. Its something we can
use or something which can
dominate us," commented
Sophomore Tony Sawtell.
The move to their new home
was surprisingly easy for the
students returning from their
three week break. It wasn't so
easy however for the
administration of
Stanford-in-Britain however. .
It took three weeks to move
the entire campus from
Grantham, and that entailed much
detailed planning. Seven large
moving vans moved all the
furniture south from Grantham.
Once the furniture arrived it had
to be directed to the numerous
rooms and storerooms. This
turned out to be the largest part
of the job.
Workmen had been renovating
the house since early January. The
most difficult tasks were to install
central heating and modern
plumbing in only throe months
time.
The reason for the move is
simple and similar to the reason
for the Austrian campus's move to
Vienna: Harlaxton manor was just
too far from London.
Too Remote
"We were too remote, too far
from London, and it was just too
expensive to get to London,"
explained George Docker, director
of admini. ration for the English
campus. Train fare from
Grantham to London was $3.60
one way, compared to the $.84
fare from Maidenhead to London.
Docker continued, "It
happened to be available at the
time we were looking, it was big
enough, and it was near London,
London Airport, and Oxford."
Cliveden House is one of the
most famous great houses in
Britain. Home of the Astor
family, it was the meeting set of
the famed "Cliveden Set" during
the 1930's which is alleged to
have included some of the most
powerful men in Britain and to
have engineered Britain's
appeasement policy towards
Hitler's Germany.
It was also one of the main
sites of the "Profumo Scandal" in
the early 1960'5. It was at
Cliveden that Defense Minister
John Profumo met Christine
Keeler, setting off one of the
greatest sex scandals of the
decade.
Gathering Ground
The house was famous before
the Profumo scandal as one of the
major gathering places for English
royality and peerage. Queen
Elizabeth is said to have been a

frequent visitor to the house
before the Profumo affair
The house is now owned by
the National Trust, a government
agency charged with preserving
historic homes. Stanford leases
the house on 21 year lease at
$6000 a year. The lease has
breakoff clauses at seven and 14
years.
The local newspapers have
given the group a warm reception.
The "Maidenhead Advertiser" ran
a report from one of its former
reporters now in America
reassuring its readers that
Stanford students are quite pacific
and nothing like the violent
revolutionaries at San Francisco
State and Berkeley, The article
referred to the fact that "Stanford
prides itself us being a training
ground for most of America's
business tycoons," that students
behave quite rationally, as befits
future businessmen.
