# Dance Drama
## 
### 
A dance drama depicting the
horrors of chemical and biological
warfare and counter-insurgency is
being organized by graduate
student Mona Williams. The
drama would provide an alternate
means besides sitting-in of
expressing opposition to the SRI
and Stanford research.
Dance expertise is not
required. Boys are especially
welcome. Those interested should
meet with Miss Williams at 5 p.m.
at the fountain in the Old Union
Courtyard in front of the Little
Theater.
