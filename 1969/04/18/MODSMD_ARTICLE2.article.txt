I have received the attached report
from the Stanford judicial Council and
have discussed its implications with
faculty members on my advisory
committee on campus disruptions and
with appropriate administrative officers.
I intend to report on these matters to
the Academic Council prior to taking
action, and have called a special meeting
for this purpose at 11 a.m. Friday
(APRIL 18) in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Members of the Academic Council
are requested to make alternative
arrangements or cancel classes normally
held at that hour.
Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
In The Matter of the Occupancy of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
Proceedings
On April 11, 1969, the President of
the University, Dr. Kenneth S. Pitzer,
formally notified the Stanford Judicial
Council that he had concluded that
certain members of the Stanford
community had violated the University
Policy on Campus Disruption by
occupying the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in such a way as to prohibit
the carrying out of University business.
Dr. Pitzer requested that the Council
take jurisdiction over disciplinary
proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would
hold hearings on April 16, 1969, to
determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely
to aid the Council in determining what
further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those
persons involved in the occupation of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
were properly represented, the Council
directly requested that such persons

appoint someone to act as counsel on
their behalf. Upon notification that this
request had been refused, the Council
appointed an attorney, Richard Kuhns,
to represent all members of the
Stanford community interested in
eliciting facts showing that no
disruption had occurred or that the level
of any disruption was less than it
otherwise might appear.
The Council proceeded to take
testimony from witnesses called both by
it and by Mr. Kuhns, and to hear oral
argument on various legal aspects of the
case. Upon due deliberation the Council
made specific findings of facts as
follows:
Findings of Facts
1. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the actions of
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory constitute a
disruption of an "approved activity" of
the University under the Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the current case
involves "extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
in that:
a. There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
b. There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
c. There is serious danger that
certain individuals or groups of
individuals will attempt to retaliate with
force against those persons occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
d. A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
e. Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

have refused to cooperate with the
Stanford Judicial Council by voting not
to send a representative to participate in
these hearings.
g. The occupation has lasted for
seven full days and the time of
voluntary termination cannot be
ascertained.
Holdings
1. The Council, by a vote of 5 to 2,
suggests that upon publication of this
decision the President take it upon
himself, pursuant to Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968„
to take the following steps:
a. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the area immediately
surrounding be declared closed as of
noon Friday, April 18, 1969, until noon
Friday, April 25, 1969 to all persons
except to those specifically appointed
by the President solely for the purpose
of maintaining the security of the
premises.
b. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory be reopened at noon Friday,
April 25, 1969, to personnel and only
to personnel having pertinent business
therein. Pertinent business is that
related to normal operation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory and
precludes acts which disrupt said normal
operations.
c. that the President of the
University, upon his determination that
unauthorized persons have
entered the Applied Electronics
Laboratory or its immediate
environs in violation of (a) or (b)
above, summarily impose upon
such persons the following
sanctions:
(i) with respect to Faculty
and staff personnel,
immediate temporary
suspension of salary, such
suspension in no event to
exceed the equivalent of
25% of the salary computed
for the current academic
year on a 12 month basis
from September 1968
through September 1969.
(ii) with respect to students
(whether registered or
merely eligible to register
without formal application),
immediate temporary
.suspension from the
University.
d. that the President of the
University shall immediately
notify any individual so
disciplined.
e. that said notice shall inform
each such individual that the
sanctions so imposed are
temporary in nature and shall be
in effect only until such time as
the Stanford Judicial Council, or
other appropriate tribunal having
jurisdiction, holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding the
individual's violation or
non-violation of the University
Policy on Campus Disruptions.
Such a hearing will be granted on
request and is, and shall be treated
in all respects, as a case brought
under section A.3(b) of the
Council's Rules. Priority will be
given to all cases in which the
person requesting a hearing
appends a letter certifying that he
in no way violated either
provision (a) or (b).
112. that during the remainder of
the current academic quarter the
President may summarily impose
sanctions under (c) above, subject
to the limitations contained in (d)
and (e) above, regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus provided all the
following conditions have
occurred:
(1) the President is
convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the
occupation constitutes a
violation of the University
Policy on Campus
Disruption and takes
reasonable steps so to
inform those engaged in
such occupation.
(2) the President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption requests
that those persons allegedly
occupying the building
unlawfully immediately

vacate the building, and ten
or more such persons refuse
to do so.
(3) of those persons who
remain in occupation after
having been requested to
leave under (2) above, ten
or more refuse to give their
names and show
identification when
requested to do so by the
President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The Council further
suggests that with respect to those
persons whom the President
determines have violated the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption, but who are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the
Stanford Judicial Council or to
disciplinary measures by the
University President or other
University tribunal, the President
seek a civil injunction to prohibit
such activities and, if
unsuccessful, consult with the
District Attorney of Santa Clara
County for the purpose of
instituting appropriate criminal
action.

Dissent
We concur in the findings of
the Council that:
1. There is a disruption of an
"approved activity" of the
University.
2. The current case involves
"extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
Under Section IV the President
has primary responsibility to
adjudicate violations of University

Policy when there are
extraordinary circumstances. Even
if the Council determines that
extraordinary circumstances exist,
however, it may not, consistent
with the Charter, make
recommendations to the President
to impose sanctions on individuals
without a prior hearing. An
important reason for the
promulgation of the Charter last
spring was to protect students in
political cases such as this one.
In any student disciplinary
case, the full extent of the
Council's power is to make
recommendations to the
President. In effect, the Council
has decided to make
recommendations without either
individual hearings or the
guarantees of defendant rights at
those hearings.
The Charter provides that in
any student disciplinary case in
which the Council takes part
students are guaranteed the right
"to be considered innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt." (Section II.F.10). Under
this decision students may be
temporarily suspended from the
University until they request a
hearing by the Council.
Temporary suspensions
necessarily imply a finding of
guilt.
In this case the President
clearly has the power to institute
summary action against
individuals he deems to be
violating University policy;
however, the Judicial Council
does not have the power to
recommend such actions to the
President because such
recommendations constitute
Council action without the
Charter requirements for due
process.
We recommend that the case
be returned to the President
because the Council cannot take
action on the substance of this
case at this time.

further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those
persons involved in the occupation of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
were properly represented, the Council
directly requested that such persons

appoint someone to act as counsel on
their behalf. Upon notification that this
request had been refused, the Council
appointed an attorney, Richard Kuhns,
to represent all members of the
Stanford community interested in
eliciting facts showing that no
disruption had occurred or that the level
of any disruption was less than it
otherwise might appear.
The Council proceeded to take
testimony from witnesses called both by
it and by Mr. Kuhns, and to hear oral
argument on various legal aspects of the
case. Upon due deliberation the Council
made specific findings of facts as
follows:
Findings of Facts
1. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the actions of
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory constitute a
disruption of an "approved activity" of
the University under the Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the current case
involves "extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
in that:
a. There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
b. There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
c. There is serious danger that
certain individuals or groups of
individuals will attempt to retaliate with
force against those persons occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
d. A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
e. Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

have refused to cooperate with the
Stanford Judicial Council by voting not
to send a representative to participate in
these hearings.
g. The occupation has lasted for
seven full days and the time of
voluntary termination cannot be
ascertained.
Holdings
1. The Council, by a vote of 5 to 2,
suggests that upon publication of this
decision the President take it upon
himself, pursuant to Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968„
to take the following steps:
a. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the area immediately
surrounding be declared closed as of
noon Friday, April 18, 1969, until noon
Friday, April 25, 1969 to all persons
except to those specifically appointed
by the President solely for the purpose
of maintaining the security of the
premises.
b. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory be reopened at noon Friday,
April 25, 1969, to personnel and only
to personnel having pertinent business
therein. Pertinent business is that
related to normal operation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory and
precludes acts which disrupt said normal
operations.
c. that the President of the
University, upon his determination that
unauthorized persons have
entered the Applied Electronics
Laboratory or its immediate
environs in violation of (a) or (b)
above, summarily impose upon
such persons the following
sanctions:
(i) with respect to Faculty
and staff personnel,
immediate temporary
suspension of salary, such
suspension in no event to
exceed the equivalent of
25% of the salary computed
for the current academic
year on a 12 month basis
from September 1968
through September 1969.
(ii) with respect to students
(whether registered or
merely eligible to register
without formal application),
immediate temporary
.suspension from the
University.
d. that the President of the
University shall immediately
notify any individual so
disciplined.
e. that said notice shall inform
each such individual that the
sanctions so imposed are
temporary in nature and shall be
in effect only until such time as
the Stanford Judicial Council, or
other appropriate tribunal having
jurisdiction, holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding the
individual's violation or
non-violation of the University
Policy on Campus Disruptions.
Such a hearing will be granted on
request and is, and shall be treated
in all respects, as a case brought
under section A.3(b) of the
Council's Rules. Priority will be
given to all cases in which the
person requesting a hearing
appends a letter certifying that he
in no way violated either
provision (a) or (b).
112. that during the remainder of
the current academic quarter the
President may summarily impose
sanctions under (c) above, subject
to the limitations contained in (d)
and (e) above, regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus provided all the
following conditions have
occurred:
(1) the President is
convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the
occupation constitutes a
violation of the University
Policy on Campus
Disruption and takes
reasonable steps so to
inform those engaged in
such occupation.
(2) the President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption requests
that those persons allegedly
occupying the building
unlawfully immediately

vacate the building, and ten
or more such persons refuse
to do so.
(3) of those persons who
remain in occupation after
having been requested to
leave under (2) above, ten
or more refuse to give their
names and show
identification when
requested to do so by the
President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The Council further
suggests that with respect to those
persons whom the President
determines have violated the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption, but who are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the
Stanford Judicial Council or to
disciplinary measures by the
University President or other
University tribunal, the President
seek a civil injunction to prohibit
such activities and, if
unsuccessful, consult with the
District Attorney of Santa Clara
County for the purpose of
instituting appropriate criminal
action.

Dissent
We concur in the findings of
the Council that:
1. There is a disruption of an
"approved activity" of the
University.
2. The current case involves
"extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
Under Section IV the President
has primary responsibility to
adjudicate violations of University

Policy when there are
extraordinary circumstances. Even
if the Council determines that
extraordinary circumstances exist,
however, it may not, consistent
with the Charter, make
recommendations to the President
to impose sanctions on individuals
without a prior hearing. An
important reason for the
promulgation of the Charter last
spring was to protect students in
political cases such as this one.
In any student disciplinary
case, the full extent of the
Council's power is to make
recommendations to the
President. In effect, the Council
has decided to make
recommendations without either
individual hearings or the
guarantees of defendant rights at
those hearings.
The Charter provides that in
any student disciplinary case in
which the Council takes part
students are guaranteed the right
"to be considered innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt." (Section II.F.10). Under
this decision students may be
temporarily suspended from the
University until they request a
hearing by the Council.
Temporary suspensions
necessarily imply a finding of
guilt.
In this case the President
clearly has the power to institute
summary action against
individuals he deems to be
violating University policy;
however, the Judicial Council
does not have the power to
recommend such actions to the
President because such
recommendations constitute
Council action without the
Charter requirements for due
process.
We recommend that the case
be returned to the President
because the Council cannot take
action on the substance of this
case at this time.

In The Matter of the Occupancy of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
Proceedings
On April 11, 1969, the President of
the University, Dr. Kenneth S. Pitzer,
formally notified the Stanford Judicial
Council that he had concluded that
certain members of the Stanford
community had violated the University
Policy on Campus Disruption by
occupying the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in such a way as to prohibit
the carrying out of University business.
Dr. Pitzer requested that the Council
take jurisdiction over disciplinary
proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would
hold hearings on April 16, 1969, to
determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely
to aid the Council in determining what
further action, if any, should be taken.

proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would

determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely

further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those

Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

Holdings
1. The Council, by a vote of 5 to 2,
suggests that upon publication of this
decision the President take it upon
himself, pursuant to Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968„
to take the following steps:
a. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the area immediately
surrounding be declared closed as of
noon Friday, April 18, 1969, until noon
Friday, April 25, 1969 to all persons
except to those specifically appointed
by the President solely for the purpose
of maintaining the security of the
premises.
b. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory be reopened at noon Friday,
April 25, 1969, to personnel and only
to personnel having pertinent business
therein. Pertinent business is that
related to normal operation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory and
precludes acts which disrupt said normal
operations.
c. that the President of the
University, upon his determination that
unauthorized persons have
entered the Applied Electronics
Laboratory or its immediate
environs in violation of (a) or (b)
above, summarily impose upon
such persons the following
sanctions:
(i) with respect to Faculty
and staff personnel,
immediate temporary
suspension of salary, such
suspension in no event to
exceed the equivalent of
25% of the salary computed
for the current academic
year on a 12 month basis
from September 1968
through September 1969.
(ii) with respect to students
(whether registered or
merely eligible to register
without formal application),
immediate temporary
.suspension from the
University.
d. that the President of the
University shall immediately
notify any individual so
disciplined.
e. that said notice shall inform
each such individual that the
sanctions so imposed are
temporary in nature and shall be
in effect only until such time as
the Stanford Judicial Council, or
other appropriate tribunal having
jurisdiction, holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding the
individual's violation or
non-violation of the University
Policy on Campus Disruptions.
Such a hearing will be granted on
request and is, and shall be treated
in all respects, as a case brought
under section A.3(b) of the
Council's Rules. Priority will be
given to all cases in which the
person requesting a hearing
appends a letter certifying that he
in no way violated either
provision (a) or (b).
112. that during the remainder of
the current academic quarter the
President may summarily impose
sanctions under (c) above, subject
to the limitations contained in (d)
and (e) above, regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus provided all the
following conditions have
occurred:
(1) the President is
convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the
occupation constitutes a
violation of the University
Policy on Campus
Disruption and takes
reasonable steps so to
inform those engaged in
such occupation.
(2) the President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption requests
that those persons allegedly
occupying the building
unlawfully immediately

vacate the building, and ten
or more such persons refuse
to do so.
(3) of those persons who
remain in occupation after
having been requested to
leave under (2) above, ten
or more refuse to give their
names and show
identification when
requested to do so by the
President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The Council further
suggests that with respect to those
persons whom the President
determines have violated the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption, but who are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the
Stanford Judicial Council or to
disciplinary measures by the
University President or other
University tribunal, the President
seek a civil injunction to prohibit
such activities and, if
unsuccessful, consult with the
District Attorney of Santa Clara
County for the purpose of
instituting appropriate criminal
action.

Dissent
We concur in the findings of
the Council that:
1. There is a disruption of an
"approved activity" of the
University.
2. The current case involves
"extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
Under Section IV the President
has primary responsibility to
adjudicate violations of University

Policy when there are
extraordinary circumstances. Even
if the Council determines that
extraordinary circumstances exist,
however, it may not, consistent
with the Charter, make
recommendations to the President
to impose sanctions on individuals
without a prior hearing. An
important reason for the
promulgation of the Charter last
spring was to protect students in
political cases such as this one.
In any student disciplinary
case, the full extent of the
Council's power is to make
recommendations to the
President. In effect, the Council
has decided to make
recommendations without either
individual hearings or the
guarantees of defendant rights at
those hearings.
The Charter provides that in
any student disciplinary case in
which the Council takes part
students are guaranteed the right
"to be considered innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt." (Section II.F.10). Under
this decision students may be
temporarily suspended from the
University until they request a
hearing by the Council.
Temporary suspensions
necessarily imply a finding of
guilt.
In this case the President
clearly has the power to institute
summary action against
individuals he deems to be
violating University policy;
however, the Judicial Council
does not have the power to
recommend such actions to the
President because such
recommendations constitute
Council action without the
Charter requirements for due
process.
We recommend that the case
be returned to the President
because the Council cannot take
action on the substance of this
case at this time.

I intend to report on these matters to
the Academic Council prior to taking
action, and have called a special meeting
for this purpose at 11 a.m. Friday

Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
In The Matter of the Occupancy of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
Proceedings
On April 11, 1969, the President of
the University, Dr. Kenneth S. Pitzer,
formally notified the Stanford Judicial
Council that he had concluded that
certain members of the Stanford
community had violated the University
Policy on Campus Disruption by
occupying the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in such a way as to prohibit
the carrying out of University business.
Dr. Pitzer requested that the Council
take jurisdiction over disciplinary
proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would
hold hearings on April 16, 1969, to
determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely
to aid the Council in determining what
further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those
persons involved in the occupation of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
were properly represented, the Council
directly requested that such persons

appoint someone to act as counsel on
their behalf. Upon notification that this
request had been refused, the Council
appointed an attorney, Richard Kuhns,
to represent all members of the
Stanford community interested in
eliciting facts showing that no
disruption had occurred or that the level
of any disruption was less than it
otherwise might appear.
The Council proceeded to take
testimony from witnesses called both by
it and by Mr. Kuhns, and to hear oral
argument on various legal aspects of the
case. Upon due deliberation the Council
made specific findings of facts as
follows:
Findings of Facts
1. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the actions of
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory constitute a
disruption of an "approved activity" of
the University under the Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the current case
involves "extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
in that:
a. There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
b. There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
c. There is serious danger that
certain individuals or groups of
individuals will attempt to retaliate with
force against those persons occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
d. A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
e. Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

individual's violation or
non-violation of the University
Policy on Campus Disruptions.
Such a hearing will be granted on
request and is, and shall be treated
in all respects, as a case brought

Stanford campus provided all the
following conditions have
occurred:
(1) the President is
convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the
occupation constitutes a
violation of the University
Policy on Campus
Disruption and takes
reasonable steps so to
inform those engaged in
such occupation.

Campus Disruption requests

persons whom the President
determines have violated the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption, but who are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the
Stanford Judicial Council or to

Dissent
We concur in the findings of
the Council that:
1. There is a disruption of an
"approved activity" of the
University.
2. The current case involves
"extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
Under Section IV the President
has primary responsibility to
adjudicate violations of University

Policy when there are
extraordinary circumstances. Even
if the Council determines that
extraordinary circumstances exist,
however, it may not, consistent
with the Charter, make
recommendations to the President
to impose sanctions on individuals
without a prior hearing. An
important reason for the
promulgation of the Charter last
spring was to protect students in
political cases such as this one.
In any student disciplinary
case, the full extent of the
Council's power is to make
recommendations to the
President. In effect, the Council
has decided to make
recommendations without either
individual hearings or the
guarantees of defendant rights at
those hearings.
The Charter provides that in
any student disciplinary case in
which the Council takes part
students are guaranteed the right
"to be considered innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt." (Section II.F.10). Under
this decision students may be
temporarily suspended from the
University until they request a
hearing by the Council.
Temporary suspensions
necessarily imply a finding of
guilt.
In this case the President
clearly has the power to institute
summary action against
individuals he deems to be
violating University policy;
however, the Judicial Council
does not have the power to
recommend such actions to the
President because such
recommendations constitute
Council action without the
Charter requirements for due
process.
We recommend that the case
be returned to the President
because the Council cannot take
action on the substance of this
case at this time.

I have received the attached report
from the Stanford judicial Council and
have discussed its implications with
faculty members on my advisory
committee on campus disruptions and
with appropriate administrative officers.
I intend to report on these matters to
the Academic Council prior to taking
action, and have called a special meeting
for this purpose at 11 a.m. Friday
(APRIL 18) in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Members of the Academic Council
are requested to make alternative
arrangements or cancel classes normally
held at that hour.
Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
In The Matter of the Occupancy of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
Proceedings
On April 11, 1969, the President of
the University, Dr. Kenneth S. Pitzer,
formally notified the Stanford Judicial
Council that he had concluded that
certain members of the Stanford
community had violated the University
Policy on Campus Disruption by
occupying the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in such a way as to prohibit
the carrying out of University business.
Dr. Pitzer requested that the Council
take jurisdiction over disciplinary
proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would
hold hearings on April 16, 1969, to
determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely
to aid the Council in determining what
further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those
persons involved in the occupation of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
were properly represented, the Council
directly requested that such persons

appoint someone to act as counsel on
their behalf. Upon notification that this
request had been refused, the Council
appointed an attorney, Richard Kuhns,
to represent all members of the
Stanford community interested in
eliciting facts showing that no
disruption had occurred or that the level
of any disruption was less than it
otherwise might appear.
The Council proceeded to take
testimony from witnesses called both by
it and by Mr. Kuhns, and to hear oral
argument on various legal aspects of the
case. Upon due deliberation the Council
made specific findings of facts as
follows:
Findings of Facts
1. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the actions of
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory constitute a
disruption of an "approved activity" of
the University under the Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the current case
involves "extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
in that:
a. There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
b. There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
c. There is serious danger that
certain individuals or groups of
individuals will attempt to retaliate with
force against those persons occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
d. A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
e. Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

have refused to cooperate with the
Stanford Judicial Council by voting not
to send a representative to participate in
these hearings.
g. The occupation has lasted for
seven full days and the time of
voluntary termination cannot be
ascertained.
Holdings
1. The Council, by a vote of 5 to 2,
suggests that upon publication of this
decision the President take it upon
himself, pursuant to Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968„
to take the following steps:
a. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the area immediately
surrounding be declared closed as of
noon Friday, April 18, 1969, until noon
Friday, April 25, 1969 to all persons
except to those specifically appointed
by the President solely for the purpose
of maintaining the security of the
premises.
b. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory be reopened at noon Friday,
April 25, 1969, to personnel and only
to personnel having pertinent business
therein. Pertinent business is that
related to normal operation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory and
precludes acts which disrupt said normal
operations.
c. that the President of the
University, upon his determination that
unauthorized persons have
entered the Applied Electronics
Laboratory or its immediate
environs in violation of (a) or (b)
above, summarily impose upon
such persons the following
sanctions:
(i) with respect to Faculty
and staff personnel,
immediate temporary
suspension of salary, such
suspension in no event to
exceed the equivalent of
25% of the salary computed
for the current academic
year on a 12 month basis
from September 1968
through September 1969.
(ii) with respect to students
(whether registered or
merely eligible to register
without formal application),
immediate temporary
.suspension from the
University.
d. that the President of the
University shall immediately
notify any individual so
disciplined.
e. that said notice shall inform
each such individual that the

under section A.3(b) of the
Council's Rules. Priority will be
given to all cases in which the
person requesting a hearing

Dissent
We concur in the findings of
the Council that:
1. There is a disruption of an
"approved activity" of the
University.
2. The current case involves
"extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV
of the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
Under Section IV the President
has primary responsibility to
adjudicate violations of University

Policy when there are
extraordinary circumstances. Even
if the Council determines that
extraordinary circumstances exist,
however, it may not, consistent
with the Charter, make
recommendations to the President
to impose sanctions on individuals
without a prior hearing. An
important reason for the
promulgation of the Charter last
spring was to protect students in
political cases such as this one.
In any student disciplinary
case, the full extent of the
Council's power is to make
recommendations to the
President. In effect, the Council
has decided to make
recommendations without either
individual hearings or the
guarantees of defendant rights at
those hearings.
The Charter provides that in
any student disciplinary case in
which the Council takes part
students are guaranteed the right
"to be considered innocent until
proven guilty beyond a reasonable
doubt." (Section II.F.10). Under
this decision students may be
temporarily suspended from the
University until they request a
hearing by the Council.
Temporary suspensions
necessarily imply a finding of
guilt.
In this case the President
clearly has the power to institute
summary action against
individuals he deems to be
violating University policy;
however, the Judicial Council
does not have the power to
recommend such actions to the
President because such
recommendations constitute
Council action without the
Charter requirements for due
process.
We recommend that the case
be returned to the President
because the Council cannot take
action on the substance of this
case at this time.

I have received the attached report
from the Stanford judicial Council and
have discussed its implications with
faculty members on my advisory
committee on campus disruptions and
with appropriate administrative officers.
I intend to report on these matters to
the Academic Council prior to taking
action, and have called a special meeting
for this purpose at 11 a.m. Friday
(APRIL 18) in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Members of the Academic Council
are requested to make alternative
arrangements or cancel classes normally
held at that hour.

President
In The Matter of the Occupancy of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
Proceedings
On April 11, 1969, the President of
the University, Dr. Kenneth S. Pitzer,
formally notified the Stanford Judicial
Council that he had concluded that
certain members of the Stanford
community had violated the University
Policy on Campus Disruption by
occupying the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in such a way as to prohibit
the carrying out of University business.
Dr. Pitzer requested that the Council
take jurisdiction over disciplinary
proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would
hold hearings on April 16, 1969, to
determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely
to aid the Council in determining what
further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those
persons involved in the occupation of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
were properly represented, the Council
directly requested that such persons

appoint someone to act as counsel on
their behalf. Upon notification that this
request had been refused, the Council
appointed an attorney, Richard Kuhns,
to represent all members of the
Stanford community interested in
eliciting facts showing that no
disruption had occurred or that the level
of any disruption was less than it
otherwise might appear.
The Council proceeded to take
testimony from witnesses called both by
it and by Mr. Kuhns, and to hear oral
argument on various legal aspects of the
case. Upon due deliberation the Council
made specific findings of facts as
follows:
Findings of Facts
1. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the actions of
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory constitute a
disruption of an "approved activity" of
the University under the Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the current case
involves "extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
in that:
a. There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
b. There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
c. There is serious danger that
certain individuals or groups of
individuals will attempt to retaliate with
force against those persons occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
d. A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
e. Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

have refused to cooperate with the
Stanford Judicial Council by voting not
to send a representative to participate in
these hearings.
g. The occupation has lasted for
seven full days and the time of
voluntary termination cannot be
ascertained.
Holdings
1. The Council, by a vote of 5 to 2,
suggests that upon publication of this
decision the President take it upon
himself, pursuant to Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968„
to take the following steps:
a. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the area immediately
surrounding be declared closed as of
noon Friday, April 18, 1969, until noon
Friday, April 25, 1969 to all persons
except to those specifically appointed
by the President solely for the purpose
of maintaining the security of the
premises.
b. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory be reopened at noon Friday,
April 25, 1969, to personnel and only
to personnel having pertinent business
therein. Pertinent business is that
related to normal operation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory and
precludes acts which disrupt said normal
operations.
c. that the President of the
University, upon his determination that
unauthorized persons have
entered the Applied Electronics
Laboratory or its immediate
environs in violation of (a) or (b)
above, summarily impose upon
such persons the following
sanctions:
(i) with respect to Faculty
and staff personnel,
immediate temporary
suspension of salary, such
suspension in no event to
exceed the equivalent of
25% of the salary computed
for the current academic
year on a 12 month basis
from September 1968
through September 1969.
(ii) with respect to students
(whether registered or
merely eligible to register
without formal application),
immediate temporary
.suspension from the
University.
d. that the President of the
University shall immediately
notify any individual so
disciplined.
e. that said notice shall inform
each such individual that the
sanctions so imposed are
temporary in nature and shall be
in effect only until such time as
the Stanford Judicial Council, or
other appropriate tribunal having
jurisdiction, holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding the
individual's violation or
non-violation of the University
Policy on Campus Disruptions.
Such a hearing will be granted on
request and is, and shall be treated
in all respects, as a case brought
under section A.3(b) of the
Council's Rules. Priority will be
given to all cases in which the
person requesting a hearing
appends a letter certifying that he
in no way violated either
provision (a) or (b).
112. that during the remainder of
the current academic quarter the
President may summarily impose
sanctions under (c) above, subject
to the limitations contained in (d)
and (e) above, regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus provided all the
following conditions have
occurred:
(1) the President is
convinced beyond a
reasonable doubt that the
occupation constitutes a
violation of the University
Policy on Campus
Disruption and takes
reasonable steps so to
inform those engaged in
such occupation.
(2) the President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption requests
that those persons allegedly
occupying the building
unlawfully immediately

vacate the building, and ten
or more such persons refuse
to do so.
(3) of those persons who
remain in occupation after
having been requested to
leave under (2) above, ten
or more refuse to give their
names and show
identification when
requested to do so by the
President, or his
representative, pursuant to
the University Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The Council further
suggests that with respect to those
persons whom the President
determines have violated the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption, but who are not
subject to the jurisdiction of the
Stanford Judicial Council or to
disciplinary measures by the
University President or other
University tribunal, the President
seek a civil injunction to prohibit
such activities and, if
unsuccessful, consult with the
District Attorney of Santa Clara
County for the purpose of
instituting appropriate criminal
action.
