I have received the attached report
from the Stanford judicial Council and
have discussed its implications with
faculty members on my advisory
committee on campus disruptions and
with appropriate administrative officers.
I intend to report on these matters to
the Academic Council prior to taking
action, and have called a special meeting
for this purpose at 11 a.m. Friday
(APRIL 18) in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Members of the Academic Council
are requested to make alternative
arrangements or cancel classes normally
held at that hour.
Kenneth S. Pitzer
President
In The Matter of the Occupancy of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory
Proceedings
On April 11, 1969, the President of
the University, Dr. Kenneth S. Pitzer,
formally notified the Stanford Judicial
Council that he had concluded that
certain members of the Stanford
community had violated the University
Policy on Campus Disruption by
occupying the Applied Electronics
Laboratory in such a way as to prohibit
the carrying out of University business.
Dr. Pitzer requested that the Council
take jurisdiction over disciplinary
proceedings arising from such violation.
On April 15, 1969, a group of interested
students, acting pursuant to Rule A.3(c)
of the Council's rules, also requested
that the Council take appropriate
action.
Pursuant to these requests, on April
15, 1969 the Council notified the
University community that it would
hold hearings on April 16, 1969, to
determine whether or not a violation of
the Disruption Policy had occurred, and
if so, the extent of such a disruption.
No charges were brought against any
defendants; the hearing was held solely
to aid the Council in determining what
further action, if any, should be taken.
To ensure that the interests of those
persons involved in the occupation of
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
were properly represented, the Council
directly requested that such persons

appoint someone to act as counsel on
their behalf. Upon notification that this
request had been refused, the Council
appointed an attorney, Richard Kuhns,
to represent all members of the
Stanford community interested in
eliciting facts showing that no
disruption had occurred or that the level
of any disruption was less than it
otherwise might appear.
The Council proceeded to take
testimony from witnesses called both by
it and by Mr. Kuhns, and to hear oral
argument on various legal aspects of the
case. Upon due deliberation the Council
made specific findings of facts as
follows:
Findings of Facts
1. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the actions of
those persons occupying the Applied
Electronics Laboratory constitute a
disruption of an "approved activity" of
the University under the Policy on
Campus Disruption.
2. The members of the Council
unanimously find that the current case
involves "extraordinary circumstances"
within the meaning of Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968
in that:
a. There is imminent danger that
external forces, beyond University
control, in particular Federal troops,
may enter the campus to deal with
various aspects of the occupation.
b. There is serious danger that the
disruption will be escalated by some or
all of those persons now occupying the
Applied Electronics Laboratory.
c. There is serious danger that
certain individuals or groups of
individuals will attempt to retaliate with
force against those persons occupying
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
d. A large number of persons has
participated in the occupation.
e. Persons engaged in the occupation
have failed to cooperate with University
authorities by refusing to identify
themselves when properly requested to
do so in accordance with the Disruption
Policy.
112. Persons engaged in the occupation

have refused to cooperate with the
Stanford Judicial Council by voting not
to send a representative to participate in
these hearings.
g. The occupation has lasted for
seven full days and the time of
voluntary termination cannot be
ascertained.
Holdings
1. The Council, by a vote of 5 to 2,
suggests that upon publication of this
decision the President take it upon
himself, pursuant to Section IV of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter of 1968„
to take the following steps:
a. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory and the area immediately
surrounding be declared closed as of
noon Friday, April 18, 1969, until noon
Friday, April 25, 1969 to all persons
except to those specifically appointed
by the President solely for the purpose
of maintaining the security of the
premises.
b. that the Applied Electronics
Laboratory be reopened at noon Friday,
April 25, 1969, to personnel and only
to personnel having pertinent business
therein. Pertinent business is that
related to normal operation of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory and
precludes acts which disrupt said normal
operations.
c. that the President of the
University, upon his determination that
