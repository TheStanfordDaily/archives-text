# Batmen Face Oregons
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The varisty baseball team spent
yesterday afternoon in a lengthy
workout preparing for six
conference games in the next five
days. The four Pacific-8 teams
from the north will visit California

starting today.
Stanford's Phil Keller, who lost
a heart-breaker to USC last
weekend, will face Oregon State
in a 3:00 p.m. game in Sunken
Diamond today. The Bears beat
Washington last Friday, then

swept a twin bill from Washington
State Saturday. They're led by
shortstop Luis Barnes and catcher
Tim Gleason.
Tomorrow the Tribe hosts
Oregon in a double header starting
at 12:30 p.m. Bob Boone, who
beat UCLA last week, and Rod
Poteete, who beat USC, will pitch
for Stanford. The visiting Ducks
won two and lost one in their first
weekend of Pac-8 play.
On Monday and Tuesday, the
Tribe plays host to the
Washington teams with a double
header against WSU on Monday
and a single game against the
Washington Huskies on Tuesday.
Coach Ray Young plans to pitch
Jim Coate and Steve Dunning on
Monday and come back with
Keller on Tuesday.
In a pair of non-league games
this week, the Indians lost to
number-one ranked Santa Clara.


OFF THE WRlSTSâ€”Stanford's all-purpose third baseman-pitcher Bob Boone knocks in a run for the Tribe in a recent
contest... a neat trick without a bat. Boone, bat and all, will lead the Indians against Oregon State this afternoon at 3:00
p.m. at the Sunken Diamond. Tomorrow, the Oregon Ducks are in for a twin bill with Coach Ray Young's nine as the
Pae-8 season enters its second week.
