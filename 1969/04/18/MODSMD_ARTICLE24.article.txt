# Track Champs
## Trojan Trouble 
### J. B 
Southern California has not
lost to Stanford in dual meet
competition since 1933. Southern
California is the defending
national track champions, and
Southern California is undefeated
so far this year.
Tomorrow the Trojans meet
the game, but relatively thin Tribe
at 1:15 p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Last week, USC needed to
come from behind in the final
event of the day—the mile
relay—to turn back an inspired
Oregon team. But while the
Indians may have a chance of
knocking off the Ducks in Eugene
next Saturday, upset hopes
tomorrow are slim.
Even so, Coach Payton Jordan
feels his chargers are ready to lay
it on the line in various individual
match-ups which could preview
both conference and NCAA duels.
The team has had the workouts,
and is both psychologically and
physically ready for the
encounter.
The best event of the day
should be the 120 high hurdles,
where Rick Tipton meets his
stiffest competition of the year in
the person of Harbor J.C. transfer
Herman Franklin. Both are
undefeated in dual meet
competition, but Franklin edged
Tipton earlier this year at the
Santa Barbara Relays.
Franklin hooks up in another
duel with Stanford's fine
intermediate hurdle crew of
Randy White and Tom Kommers.
His USC running mate in this
event is Olympic pole vault
champion Bob Seagren whose
52.7 puts him in the thick of the
competition, providing his leg
doesn't bother him.
Naturally Seagren will be
favored in the pole vault as will
Lennox Miller in both sprints.
Miller, who placed second in the
Olympic 100 meters, also anchors
the sprint relay team and, if
needed, can carry the baton on
the mile relay through a sub-47
second effort.
Another good match-up will be
the high jump where Peter Boyce
and Tom Massey square off
against Park Kennedy who has a
best of 6-10. Massey returns to
action in the triple jump where he
trades leaps with Howard Pratt
(48-6) and the ever-present
Franklin (47-3).
In the distances, the flu bug hit
Greg Brock last week and may
cause Jordan to shuffle miler
Allen Sanford, steeplechaser
Brook Thomas and two-miler
Chuck Menz to new events. The
Trojans counter the Tribe distance
strength with NCAA indoor two
mile champion Carl Trentadue.
Trentadue could drop to the
half however, where he would

face front-running Pete Fairchild.
But if not, the men from Troy are
still formidable in that even with
Rich Joyce (1:57.7), Howard
Becker (1:51.1), and Terry Tubb
(1:52.3).
If SC has a weak spot, it is the
javelin where the Indians should
sweep, or possibly the 440.

Southern California is undefeated
so far this year.
Tomorrow the Trojans meet
the game, but relatively thin Tribe
at 1:15 p.m. in Stanford Stadium.
Last week, USC needed to
come from behind in the final
event of the day—the mile
relay—to turn back an inspired
Oregon team. But while the
Indians may have a chance of
knocking off the Ducks in Eugene
next Saturday, upset hopes
tomorrow are slim.
Even so, Coach Payton Jordan
feels his chargers are ready to lay
it on the line in various individual
match-ups which could preview
both conference and NCAA duels.
The team has had the workouts,
and is both psychologically and
physically ready for the
encounter.
The best event of the day
should be the 120 high hurdles,
where Rick Tipton meets his
stiffest competition of the year in
the person of Harbor J.C. transfer
Herman Franklin. Both are
undefeated in dual meet
competition, but Franklin edged
Tipton earlier this year at the
Santa Barbara Relays.
Franklin hooks up in another
duel with Stanford's fine
intermediate hurdle crew of
Randy White and Tom Kommers.
His USC running mate in this
event is Olympic pole vault
champion Bob Seagren whose
52.7 puts him in the thick of the
competition, providing his leg
doesn't bother him.
Naturally Seagren will be
favored in the pole vault as will
Lennox Miller in both sprints.
Miller, who placed second in the
Olympic 100 meters, also anchors
the sprint relay team and, if
needed, can carry the baton on
the mile relay through a sub-47
second effort.
Another good match-up will be
the high jump where Peter Boyce
and Tom Massey square off
against Park Kennedy who has a
best of 6-10. Massey returns to
action in the triple jump where he
trades leaps with Howard Pratt
(48-6) and the ever-present
Franklin (47-3).
In the distances, the flu bug hit
Greg Brock last week and may
cause Jordan to shuffle miler
Allen Sanford, steeplechaser
Brook Thomas and two-miler
Chuck Menz to new events. The
Trojans counter the Tribe distance
strength with NCAA indoor two
mile champion Carl Trentadue.
Trentadue could drop to the
half however, where he would

face front-running Pete Fairchild.
But if not, the men from Troy are
still formidable in that even with
Rich Joyce (1:57.7), Howard
Becker (1:51.1), and Terry Tubb
(1:52.3).
If SC has a weak spot, it is the
javelin where the Indians should
sweep, or possibly the 440.
Southern California has not
lost to Stanford in dual meet
competition since 1933. Southern
California is the defending
national track champions, and
Southern California is undefeated
so far this year.
