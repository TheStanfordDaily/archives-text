# Mass Meeting To Discuss, Vote On SRI Resolutions
## 
### 
Frost Amphitheater will be the site
this afternoon for an unprecedented
student body meeting. Called by
student body president Denis Hayes the
1 p.m. meeting will focus on many of
the demands and issues raised by the
April 3rd Coalition.
Topics to be discussed and voted on
at the meeting include types of research
conducted at Stanford Research
Institute (SRI), the ties between the
University and SRI and the tactics
employed by the Applied Electronics
Laboratory sit-inners.
The emphasis on issues surrounding
SRI is primarily intended to educate
students of the questions they are asked
in this week-end's mail-our referendum.
The meeting was called by President
Denis Hayes explicitly to "discuss the
entire student body's position in regard
to matters affecting the University." To
fulfill this function resolutions will be
discussed and voted upon.
The first two proposals to be voted
on support the April 3rd.-Coalition. One
compliments the group "for helping to
focus the attention of the campus upon
the nature of research being conducted
at Stanford and SRI."
The other supports the Coalition's
demands for stopping specific research
activities. The fields named are
chemical, biological and radiological
warfare, co unter-insurgency,
war-related, and classified research.
The next three resolutions focus on
tactics. The first of these asks for a
reading of student support for the sit-in.

The other two make proposals for
alternative methods of action.
One suggest the mass meeting of
students "join the April 3 Coalition to
establish a Center Against Immoral

Research in the Old Union Courtyard"
as a center for education of the
community.
The other asks for a one-day
"cessation of classes" on Wednesday.
