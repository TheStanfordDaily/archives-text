# Engineering Meeting To Discuss Research
## 
### 
Research restrictions and;, possible
solutions to the problems raised by the
Applied Electronics Laboratory sit-in
will be the subject of a meeting of the
School of Engineering. The meeting of
engineering students and faculty, to be
held in Cubberly Auditorium at 4:15, is
an outgrowth of a student-conceived
poll of engineering opinion held on
Monday.
In that Monday poll twenty-two per
cent of the Engineering students and
faculty expressed support for the goals
and demands of the April 3rd Coalition.
Sixty-six per cent of those polled
refused to support the demands.
The pollsters received completed
questionnaires from 100 of 560
undergraduates, 250 of 1400 graduate
students, and 30 of 150 faculty
members.
But students and faculty often
diverged greatly in their answers to
many questions. For instance almost
one-ouarter of the students endorsed

the Coalition demands on campus and
Stanford Research Institute research
ppolicies, only ten per cent of the
faculty polled expressed similar support.
Fully 82 per cent of the faculty do not
endorse the demands.
The poll indicated acceptance by
School of Engineering students and
faculty of limitations on certain types
of on-campus military and classified
research. Demands by the sit-in group,
the April 3rd Coalition, received
support from about one-fifth of those
responding to the poll.
Engineering students and faculty at
the Friday meeting will hear a short
speech by Dean of Engineering Joseph
Pettit. Introductory remarks will be
made by Peter Rubustelli, a senior in
electrical engineering and one of the
originators of Monday's poll. The
meeting will be moderated by
Mechanical Engineering Design Division
Director Dr. Peter Bulkelev.
