# Better Tactic?
## Students Fast Until Trustees Act 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
A diet of mainly peanut butter
sandwiches, coffee, and Tuesday's
wedding cake is one of the
inconveniences the students sitting-in at
Blank Building (formerly the AEL) have
had to put up with, but thirteen
proponents of the April 3rd Coalition's
Demands last week took an even greater

inconvenience upon themselves; they
decided to fast until the Trustees take
positive action on their demands.
The scope of the fasting has differed
with each individual, ranging from
abstaining from one meal to refraining
from all solid foods. "Each of us had
made an individual, personal decision to
fast," explained Rebecca Gordon who
has also devoted much of her time to
the sit-in since it began.
The original idea to use fasting as a
tactic for the Coalition's demands came
last Wednesday night from sophomore
Terry Fitzgerald who saw fasting as a
way "to demonstrate our true
commitment to the goals of the April
3rd movement and to protest and
publicize in a new way."
13 Fast
Over thirteen students had joined
Fitzgerald in the fast by last Saturday,
and about half of them are currently
continuing their demonstration.
"One of the major reasons I decided
to fast," stated Gordon, is because a lot
of people were thinking that the
students in the sit-in weren't serious in
their protest and were simply enjoying
themselves."
"I have felt very strongly about
getting our demands met," freshman Ed
Drummond further explained, "and I
thought if the sit-in didn't work as a
tactic then maybe the fast would.
"We wanted to show the Trustees
that we were't immature and insincere
young people as one of the Trustees
recently stated."
"I decided to fast because I really
believe in the objectives of the
coalition," agreed Kathy Newman, "but
I didn't know what the sit-in tactic
would lead to. I thought fasting would
be a good way to protest.
"At the sit-in, I'm only one
individual out of 600 or more," she
added, "while I'm one out of only
about thirteen taking part in the fast."
Mtlle Publicity
The fasters have received little
publicity for their protest so far. Most
of them, in addition, havo received
skeptical comments doubting the
effectiveness of such an endeavor.
No official response has been given
by either the administration or the
Trustees reuardini! the fast.

"I saw it was useless and stopped,"
stated one former faster on Wednesday.
"If the Trustees aren't going to give any
favorable response to our demands
because of the sit-in, they're sure not
going to make any response because of a
fast."
"A lot of people don't understand
why anyone would go on a fast," stated
Fitzgerald. "Maybe the best way to
make them understand is to do it."
"When people question the basic
effectiveness of the fast," continued
Fitzgerald, "they want to know if we're
trying to make ourselves into martyrs."
Coals vs. Tactics
"So if people ask that," he stated, "I
respond by inquiring, 'Does that mean
you support our goals but disagree with
our tactics?'
"We feel very strongly about our
commitment and we were very serious
when we wrote to the Trustees about
our fast and our demands."
Denny Nakayama, who has
discontinued fasting after having lost
ten pounds, confessed that he started it
"with grave reservations."
"I didn't think the Trustees would
give a damn about a bunch of hungry
kids," he explained.
"I don't think they'd really care if
we all got sick," Nakayama added.
"We wouldn't be posing any real
threat to them."
"The Trustees probably aren't paying
very much attention to our fast," Miss
Gordon agreed.
Nakayama also expressed his doubts
in the effectiveness of the sit-in up to
yesterday afternoon.
Agree With Objectives
"I agree with its objectives," he said,
"but I'm not sure we're really pressuring
the Trustees to act. I think that we
should have withdrawn from AEL by
last Friday at 5 p.m. to show faith in
the Trustees."
"I wanted the sit-in to end before
Tuesday," Miss Newman added, "in
order to show good faith with the
Trustees and the Academic Senate.
"1 saw the fast as a good way to
make the Trustees trust student
commitment a little more."
Miss Newman's diet which had
consisted of only fruit juices and milk

hasn't given her a great amount of
fatigue, she professed, and has set no
definite date on which to discontinue it.
"You can exist on liquids and still
stay healthy," Miss Gordon agreed, "but
you're constantly aware of the sacrifice
being made."
"It's really strange," commented
Fitzgerald who has been fasting since
last Thursday, "to watch people eat and
not feel a need for food at the moment.
"That isn't to say, however," he
added, "that this fast has been easy."
Fitzgerald remarked that "I probably
used to eat out of greed or
something .. .1 have often gotten a
craving for something this past week,
but it's usually been a 'head thing' not a
'stomach thing.' "
"After the second day things weren't
too bad," Drummond added.
Chocolate M ilk
His diet for the past five days has
consisted of one carton of chocolate
milk per day.
"I'm hungry," Fitzgerald emphasized
finally.
"But the reason I'm hungry is
because the Trustees have refused to
act.
"And I'm going to stay hungry," he
concluded, "until the Trustees do
act . . .
". . .Just like the people of the
world are hungry for an end to the
oppression and the killing."
