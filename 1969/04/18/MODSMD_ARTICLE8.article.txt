## An End To Double-Talk 
### Harry Cleaver 
"There Is no counterinsurgency
program by that name here at
SEL. That's merely an obscure
categorization." Charles
Anderson, President of Stanford
Research Institute, as quoted in
THE DAILY yesterday.
Several times since the issuance
of the SRI-Stanford Report SRI
President Anderson has attacked
"misrepresentations" and
"distortions" of the facts.
Yet what could be a greater
distortion or a more misleading
misrepresentation than his
comments on SRI
counterinsurgency work. No, we
must admit, SRI has no
counterinsurgency program called
''SRI Counterinsurgency
Program," but it sure as -— does
have a "Regional Securities
Studies Center (RSSC)" operating
both at the SRI Hanover Facility
in the Industrial Park and the the
''Military Research and
Development Center" in Bangkok,
Thailand.
Mr. Anderson can quibble over
the name of the program but he
will have a hard time quibbling
over the names of the reports put
out by the RSSC, some of which
include: "Counterinsurgency
Communications Requirements in
Thailand," and"The Logistics
System of the Communist
Terrorist Organization in
Southern Thailand." (I refer the
interested reader to the minority
report for a more complete
listing.)
To complain as Anderson does,
that stopping research in military
cou nterinsurgency
communications research or other
research of the RSSC is to
"threaten our workers' freedom

to do the kind of research they
want to do" is shocking and
ludicrous. Fortunately the people
of this community are coming to
understand that there is no such
thing as freedom to oppress, or
freedom to design repression,
there is only a criminal license to
destroy bestowed by a ruling elite
willing to crush any challenge to
its supremacy.
Anderson knows quite well
that what constitutes
counterinsurgency and that the
term is no ''obscure
categorization." In the 1964
Dictionary of United States
Military Terms for Joint Usage
issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
counterinsurgency is officially
defined as "those military,
paramilitary, political, economic,
psychological, and civic action
taken by a government to defeat
the subversive insurgency."
This definition, which
Anderson must certainly accept, is
hardly obscure.
'Special Program'
And just as Anderson knows
about the RSSC he also knows
about the SRI 'special program' in
"Reconnaissance, Surveillance,
and Intelligence (RSI)" which
provides a special capability for
such research topics as "Intrusion
Detection," "River Surveillance,"
and "Base Defense."
SRI vaunts its RSI staff as
having, among other
qualifications, such military
experience as "reconneissance and
strike pilots." Much of the RSI
research experience, SRI
advertizes, "has been obtained on
site in Germany, Thailand,
Vietnam and throughout North
America."

The last location is of
importance because RSI studies
have included "Analysis of
surveillance in urban military
operations." When one considers
that SRI has also done work on
"Fire Arms, Violence, and Civil
Disorders," we find ourselves
facing the spectre of domestic
counterinsurgency.
Demand An End
It is imperative that we of the
university community demand an
end to the kind of double-talk and
dishonesty to which we are being
treated these days. Whether it is
SRI management quibbling about
names or the Baxter Committee
calling Electronic Warfare
"electromagnetics," it must end.
Surely the need to replace
duplicity and secretiveness with
honesty and openness is enough
reason for this community to join
in unanimous support of the April
3 Coalition's actions.
And yet openness is not
enough for we must stop that
research which contributes to
oppression whether it be
electronic warfare research at
Stanford or counterinsurgency
research at SRI. We must
understand that as students,
faculty and researchers our talents
and lives are being channeled by
the institutions of the American
ruling class into work which serves
not humanity but a powerful
elite, not the poor but the
wealthy. We must say no.

experience as "reconneissance and
strike pilots." Much of the RSI
research experience, SRI
advertizes, "has been obtained on
site in Germany, Thailand,
Vietnam and throughout North
America."

The last location is of
importance because RSI studies
have included "Analysis of
surveillance in urban military
operations." When one considers
that SRI has also done work on
"Fire Arms, Violence, and Civil
Disorders," we find ourselves
facing the spectre of domestic
counterinsurgency.
Demand An End
It is imperative that we of the
university community demand an
end to the kind of double-talk and
dishonesty to which we are being
treated these days. Whether it is
SRI management quibbling about
names or the Baxter Committee
calling Electronic Warfare
"electromagnetics," it must end.
Surely the need to replace
duplicity and secretiveness with
honesty and openness is enough
reason for this community to join
in unanimous support of the April
3 Coalition's actions.
And yet openness is not
enough for we must stop that
research which contributes to
oppression whether it be
electronic warfare research at
Stanford or counterinsurgency
research at SRI. We must
understand that as students,
faculty and researchers our talents
and lives are being channeled by
the institutions of the American
ruling class into work which serves
not humanity but a powerful
elite, not the poor but the
wealthy. We must say no.

"There Is no counterinsurgency
program by that name here at
SEL. That's merely an obscure
categorization." Charles
Anderson, President of Stanford
Research Institute, as quoted in
THE DAILY yesterday.
Several times since the issuance
of the SRI-Stanford Report SRI
President Anderson has attacked
"misrepresentations" and
"distortions" of the facts.
Yet what could be a greater
distortion or a more misleading
misrepresentation than his
comments on SRI
counterinsurgency work. No, we
must admit, SRI has no
counterinsurgency program called
''SRI Counterinsurgency
Program," but it sure as -— does
have a "Regional Securities
Studies Center (RSSC)" operating
both at the SRI Hanover Facility
in the Industrial Park and the the
''Military Research and
Development Center" in Bangkok,
Thailand.
Mr. Anderson can quibble over
the name of the program but he
will have a hard time quibbling
over the names of the reports put
out by the RSSC, some of which
include: "Counterinsurgency
Communications Requirements in
Thailand," and"The Logistics
System of the Communist
Terrorist Organization in
Southern Thailand." (I refer the
interested reader to the minority
report for a more complete
listing.)
To complain as Anderson does,
that stopping research in military
cou nterinsurgency
communications research or other
research of the RSSC is to
"threaten our workers' freedom

to do the kind of research they
want to do" is shocking and
ludicrous. Fortunately the people
of this community are coming to
understand that there is no such
thing as freedom to oppress, or
freedom to design repression,
there is only a criminal license to
destroy bestowed by a ruling elite
willing to crush any challenge to
its supremacy.
Anderson knows quite well
that what constitutes
counterinsurgency and that the
term is no ''obscure
categorization." In the 1964
Dictionary of United States
Military Terms for Joint Usage
issued by the Joint Chiefs of Staff
counterinsurgency is officially
defined as "those military,
paramilitary, political, economic,
psychological, and civic action
taken by a government to defeat
the subversive insurgency."
This definition, which
Anderson must certainly accept, is
hardly obscure.
'Special Program'
And just as Anderson knows
about the RSSC he also knows
about the SRI 'special program' in
"Reconnaissance, Surveillance,
and Intelligence (RSI)" which
provides a special capability for
such research topics as "Intrusion
Detection," "River Surveillance,"
and "Base Defense."
SRI vaunts its RSI staff as
having, among other
qualifications, such military
experience as "reconneissance and
strike pilots." Much of the RSI
research experience, SRI
advertizes, "has been obtained on
site in Germany, Thailand,
Vietnam and throughout North
America."

The last location is of
importance because RSI studies
have included "Analysis of
