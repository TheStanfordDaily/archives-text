## An Open Letter To Pitzer 
### Michael Sweeney 
DEAR Dr. PITZER:
Since the sit-in started, I have
tried to help the faculty and the
demonstrators understand each
Other's positions. It has been a
discouraging effort. Nothing has
discouraged me more than the
statement issued April 17 in your
name.
The statement contains some
"hard-line" rhetoric, apparently
intended to mollify the
reactionaries who are pressuring
you to call the cops.
If you feel you must somehow
answer the reactionaries, fine. But
please be accurate. Your
statement contains distortions of
fact.
I will be specific. Your
statement makes a great fuss over
the alleged defiance by the
demonstrators of the campus
judicial process. Your statement
isays, "an earnest effort was made
to allow those committing what
seemed to be an act of
consciencious objection to
identify themselves. Authorized
faculty and staff persons asked a
large number of demonstrators to
give their names as violating
campus policies .... Instead of
complying ...almost all the
persons confronted defied the
interviewers. One
interviewer . . . was told that if he
returned to the scene of the
demonstration he would be bodily
attacked."
In fact, the demonstrators have
proven that they are proud and
eager to tell you or anyone else
who they are. All of them have
signed their names and addresses
to a solidarity statement reading:
"I am sitting in at AEL. Wish you
were here." I was among the
signers. The demonstrators have
decided that all copies of the
solidarity statement will be given
to you if you initiate proceedings
against any individual
demonstrator.
So where is the defiance? When
the 24 faculty interviewers came
to AEL on Monday morning, they
were greeted by students who
were eager to discuss with them
the issues of the sit-in and the
bizzare things they were obliged
to say by Provost Lyman's
statement of April 13. But the
demonstrators had previously
agreed, in an action I strongly
favored, that they should not give
their names to the faculty. The
reason is obvious: only a minority
of the demonstrators would
probably be identified by
haphazard name-taking, and it was
felt to be simply jusice that all the
demonstrators share the possible
consequences of the sit-in.
You mention that one faculty
interviewer was allegedly
threatened. I do not find it
surprising that one demonstrator
(or visitor) threatened one
interviewer under these
circumstances. If anvone had laid

hands on a faculty interviewer, I
am sure that many other
demonstrators would have rush to
protect him.
But you have allowed your
name to be signed to a statement
which deliberately slanders the
demonstrators as ill-mannered
ruffians. A few tired
demonstrators, frustrated or
fearful, may have at times made
foolish threats to those whose
presence seemed to threaten
them. But the April 3 Movement,
by unanimous vote, has forbidden
any form of violence by its
members. Do you deny that it
continues to adhere to that vote?
Elsehwere, your statement
bandies about the word "moral."
Examples:
"Let nobody think that his
own moral principles exempt him
from the accepted moral
principles upon which higher
learning ... is founded."
And, "Unfortunately there
exists ... an impression that the
demonstrators at AEL are
harmlessly focusing attention on
an otherwise neglected issue of
principle."
If you had talked with the
demonstrators, I am certain that
you would agree that only one
"moral principle" guides the April
3 Coalition. That is a deep
conviction that we must save
human lives. Without any doubt,
it is a "neglected" principle. You
have said as much publicly.
The most disturbing sentence
in the entire statement is "In fact,
the demonstration is inherently an
ugly, sometimes fierce threat to
an;infrigement upon the rights of
researchers to research, students
to study, and teachers to teach."
Dr. Pitzer, I cannot believe that
those are your words. Only last
Friday you told the
demonstrators that you found the
sit-in an "impressive testimony"
of "your concern and the depth
of your solidarity." Have you
changed your evaluation of the
sit-in so much in the past few
days? If so, on the basis of what
evidence? Do you have the
testimony of your own eyes and
ears?
Your statement concludes,
"For my own part, I have left
no question that I
believe . . . research on means of
destruction must yield to research
on the instruments of peace.
These issues are not under debate.
The issue at hand is whether
Stanford shall live by procedures
of judicial due process upon
which all constituencies have
agreed."
The implication in these words
is that the power structure at
Stanford is in agreement with the
demonstrators that "research on
means of destruction" will be
stopped here and at SRI. This is a
false implication. If it is any truer
today than it was a week ago, it is

due to the efforts of those who
occupy the AEL.
And finally, you imply that the
"issue at hand" is your
"procedures of judicial due
process." Wednesday night the
Dean of Students, who acts in
your authority, argued to the
Stanford Judicial Council that
punishments of demonstrators
henceforward be imposed without
trial or hearing. I question that
this is "due process."
Dr. Pitzer, I repeat my
conviction that you act in good

faith. I have seen you state
bluntly your convictions on CBW
to the Trustees, and on classified
research to the faculty, in ways
which were bound to anger
powerful members of both those
bodies. I ask you now to act with
the same forthrightness. I do not
believe you understand the sit-in.
There is only one way you can.
Come to AEL today and talk with
those whom you find there.

Michael Sweeney

surprising that one demonstrator
(or visitor) threatened one
interviewer under these
circumstances. If anvone had laid

hands on a faculty interviewer, I
am sure that many other
demonstrators would have rush to
protect him.
But you have allowed your
name to be signed to a statement
which deliberately slanders the
demonstrators as ill-mannered
ruffians. A few tired
demonstrators, frustrated or
fearful, may have at times made
foolish threats to those whose
presence seemed to threaten
them. But the April 3 Movement,
by unanimous vote, has forbidden
any form of violence by its
members. Do you deny that it
continues to adhere to that vote?
Elsehwere, your statement
bandies about the word "moral."
Examples:
"Let nobody think that his
own moral principles exempt him
from the accepted moral
principles upon which higher
learning ... is founded."
And, "Unfortunately there
exists ... an impression that the
demonstrators at AEL are
harmlessly focusing attention on
an otherwise neglected issue of
principle."
If you had talked with the
demonstrators, I am certain that
you would agree that only one
"moral principle" guides the April
3 Coalition. That is a deep
conviction that we must save
human lives. Without any doubt,
it is a "neglected" principle. You
have said as much publicly.
The most disturbing sentence
in the entire statement is "In fact,
the demonstration is inherently an
ugly, sometimes fierce threat to
an;infrigement upon the rights of
researchers to research, students
to study, and teachers to teach."
Dr. Pitzer, I cannot believe that
those are your words. Only last
Friday you told the
demonstrators that you found the
sit-in an "impressive testimony"
of "your concern and the depth
of your solidarity." Have you
changed your evaluation of the
sit-in so much in the past few
days? If so, on the basis of what
evidence? Do you have the
testimony of your own eyes and
ears?
Your statement concludes,
"For my own part, I have left
no question that I
believe . . . research on means of
destruction must yield to research
on the instruments of peace.
These issues are not under debate.
The issue at hand is whether
Stanford shall live by procedures
of judicial due process upon
which all constituencies have
agreed."
The implication in these words
is that the power structure at
Stanford is in agreement with the
demonstrators that "research on
means of destruction" will be
stopped here and at SRI. This is a
false implication. If it is any truer
today than it was a week ago, it is

due to the efforts of those who
occupy the AEL.
And finally, you imply that the
"issue at hand" is your
"procedures of judicial due
process." Wednesday night the
Dean of Students, who acts in
your authority, argued to the
Stanford Judicial Council that
punishments of demonstrators
henceforward be imposed without
trial or hearing. I question that
this is "due process."
Dr. Pitzer, I repeat my
conviction that you act in good

faith. I have seen you state
bluntly your convictions on CBW
to the Trustees, and on classified
research to the faculty, in ways
which were bound to anger
powerful members of both those
bodies. I ask you now to act with
the same forthrightness. I do not
believe you understand the sit-in.
There is only one way you can.
Come to AEL today and talk with
those whom you find there.
Sincerely,

DEAR Dr. PITZER:
Since the sit-in started, I have
tried to help the faculty and the
demonstrators understand each
Other's positions. It has been a
discouraging effort. Nothing has
discouraged me more than the
statement issued April 17 in your
name.
The statement contains some
"hard-line" rhetoric, apparently
intended to mollify the
reactionaries who are pressuring
you to call the cops.
If you feel you must somehow
answer the reactionaries, fine. But
please be accurate. Your
statement contains distortions of
fact.
I will be specific. Your
statement makes a great fuss over
the alleged defiance by the
demonstrators of the campus
judicial process. Your statement
isays, "an earnest effort was made
to allow those committing what
seemed to be an act of
consciencious objection to
identify themselves. Authorized
faculty and staff persons asked a
large number of demonstrators to
give their names as violating
campus policies .... Instead of
complying ...almost all the
persons confronted defied the
interviewers. One
interviewer . . . was told that if he
returned to the scene of the
demonstration he would be bodily
attacked."
In fact, the demonstrators have
proven that they are proud and
eager to tell you or anyone else
who they are. All of them have
signed their names and addresses
to a solidarity statement reading:
"I am sitting in at AEL. Wish you
were here." I was among the
signers. The demonstrators have
decided that all copies of the
solidarity statement will be given
to you if you initiate proceedings
against any individual
demonstrator.
So where is the defiance? When
the 24 faculty interviewers came
to AEL on Monday morning, they
were greeted by students who
were eager to discuss with them
the issues of the sit-in and the
bizzare things they were obliged
to say by Provost Lyman's
statement of April 13. But the
demonstrators had previously
agreed, in an action I strongly
favored, that they should not give
their names to the faculty. The
reason is obvious: only a minority
of the demonstrators would
probably be identified by
haphazard name-taking, and it was
felt to be simply jusice that all the
demonstrators share the possible
consequences of the sit-in.
You mention that one faculty
interviewer was allegedly
threatened. I do not find it
surprising that one demonstrator
(or visitor) threatened one
interviewer under these
circumstances. If anvone had laid

is that the power structure at
Stanford is in agreement with the
demonstrators that "research on
means of destruction" will be
stopped here and at SRI. This is a
false implication. If it is any truer
today than it was a week ago, it is

due to the efforts of those who
occupy the AEL.
And finally, you imply that the
"issue at hand" is your
"procedures of judicial due
process." Wednesday night the
Dean of Students, who acts in
your authority, argued to the
Stanford Judicial Council that
punishments of demonstrators
henceforward be imposed without
trial or hearing. I question that
this is "due process."
Dr. Pitzer, I repeat my
conviction that you act in good

faith. I have seen you state
bluntly your convictions on CBW
to the Trustees, and on classified
research to the faculty, in ways
which were bound to anger
powerful members of both those
bodies. I ask you now to act with
the same forthrightness. I do not
believe you understand the sit-in.
There is only one way you can.
Come to AEL today and talk with
those whom you find there.
Sincerely,
Michael Sweeney
DEAR Dr. PITZER:
Since the sit-in started, I have
tried to help the faculty and the
demonstrators understand each
Other's positions. It has been a
discouraging effort. Nothing has
discouraged me more than the
statement issued April 17 in your
name.
The statement contains some
"hard-line" rhetoric, apparently
intended to mollify the
reactionaries who are pressuring
you to call the cops.
If you feel you must somehow
answer the reactionaries, fine. But
please be accurate. Your
statement contains distortions of
fact.
I will be specific. Your
statement makes a great fuss over
the alleged defiance by the
demonstrators of the campus
judicial process. Your statement
isays, "an earnest effort was made
to allow those committing what
seemed to be an act of
consciencious objection to
identify themselves. Authorized
faculty and staff persons asked a
large number of demonstrators to
give their names as violating
campus policies .... Instead of
complying ...almost all the
persons confronted defied the
interviewers. One
interviewer . . . was told that if he
returned to the scene of the
demonstration he would be bodily
attacked."
In fact, the demonstrators have
proven that they are proud and
eager to tell you or anyone else
who they are. All of them have
signed their names and addresses
to a solidarity statement reading:
"I am sitting in at AEL. Wish you
were here." I was among the
signers. The demonstrators have
decided that all copies of the
solidarity statement will be given
to you if you initiate proceedings
against any individual
demonstrator.
So where is the defiance? When
the 24 faculty interviewers came
to AEL on Monday morning, they
were greeted by students who
were eager to discuss with them
the issues of the sit-in and the
bizzare things they were obliged
to say by Provost Lyman's
statement of April 13. But the
demonstrators had previously
agreed, in an action I strongly
favored, that they should not give
their names to the faculty. The
reason is obvious: only a minority
of the demonstrators would
probably be identified by
haphazard name-taking, and it was
felt to be simply jusice that all the
demonstrators share the possible
consequences of the sit-in.
You mention that one faculty
interviewer was allegedly
threatened. I do not find it
surprising that one demonstrator
(or visitor) threatened one
interviewer under these
circumstances. If anvone had laid

hands on a faculty interviewer, I
am sure that many other
demonstrators would have rush to
protect him.
But you have allowed your
name to be signed to a statement
which deliberately slanders the
demonstrators as ill-mannered
ruffians. A few tired
demonstrators, frustrated or
fearful, may have at times made
foolish threats to those whose
presence seemed to threaten
them. But the April 3 Movement,
by unanimous vote, has forbidden
any form of violence by its
members. Do you deny that it
continues to adhere to that vote?
Elsehwere, your statement
bandies about the word "moral."
Examples:
"Let nobody think that his
own moral principles exempt him
from the accepted moral
principles upon which higher
learning ... is founded."
And, "Unfortunately there
exists ... an impression that the
demonstrators at AEL are
harmlessly focusing attention on
an otherwise neglected issue of
principle."
If you had talked with the
demonstrators, I am certain that
you would agree that only one
"moral principle" guides the April
3 Coalition. That is a deep
conviction that we must save
human lives. Without any doubt,
it is a "neglected" principle. You
have said as much publicly.
The most disturbing sentence
in the entire statement is "In fact,
the demonstration is inherently an
ugly, sometimes fierce threat to
an;infrigement upon the rights of
researchers to research, students
to study, and teachers to teach."
Dr. Pitzer, I cannot believe that
those are your words. Only last
Friday you told the
demonstrators that you found the
sit-in an "impressive testimony"
of "your concern and the depth
of your solidarity." Have you
changed your evaluation of the
sit-in so much in the past few
days? If so, on the basis of what
evidence? Do you have the
testimony of your own eyes and
ears?
Your statement concludes,
"For my own part, I have left
no question that I
believe . . . research on means of
destruction must yield to research
on the instruments of peace.
These issues are not under debate.
The issue at hand is whether
Stanford shall live by procedures
of judicial due process upon
which all constituencies have
agreed."
The implication in these words
is that the power structure at
Stanford is in agreement with the
demonstrators that "research on
means of destruction" will be
stopped here and at SRI. This is a
false implication. If it is any truer
