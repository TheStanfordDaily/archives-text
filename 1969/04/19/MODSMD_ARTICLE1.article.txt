# BSU Demands Changes
## Rally Airs Research 
### MICHAEL KUHL KIM THORBURN 
The Black Students Union
(BSU) has demanded tighter ties
between the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) and the University
and unilateral control by a
committee, including at least one
BSU member, of University
research contracts.
The BSU action was part of an
extraordinary rally of
approximately 8,000 members of
the University community called
yesterday afternoon in Frost
Ampitheater by Associated
Students President Denis Hayes.
Political science grad student
Paul Bernstein noted, "We should
look inward to find moral
concerns, and then take actions so
we can respect ourselves as human
beings." His remarks before the
three hour session was adjourned
appeared to summarize the
thoughts of most of the speakers.
Topics Of Discussion
Hayes scheduled the open
campus meeting to discuss the
nature of research carried on at
Stanford, the operation of SRI
and the ramifications of various
suggested alternative
arrangements, and tactics to be

employed in obtaining the
demands of the April 3
Movement.
"SRI should turn to East Palo
Alto to show what we can do
when we do research," BSU
chairman Leo Bazile said midway
through the meeting. Members of
the group marched on the stage to
express their indignation at the
direction of current protest over
war-related research.
Bruce Franklin agreed with the
BSU statement saying that
coercion is the only way that
students can liberate Third World
peoples from this country's
imperialism.
Franklin's remarks were
questioned by Gil Diaz, a junior in
political science, who asked,
"How do you know that these
people want to be liberated?"
Lincoln Malik, a graduate
student from Iraq, and member of
the April 3 Coalition, answered
for the Third World and the
crowd's emotion reached a peak
during his fiery speech. Several
times they broke into wild
applause and he received an
enthusiastic ovation.
Malik said that the desire of
the Third World peoples to free

themselves was shown by the
struggles in Vietnam and Latin
America. He added that the
Stanford community had a
choice: to aid the Third World in
its struggle or do nothing and
thereby aid the exploiters.
Rejection of Recommendation
Another speaker was Bob
Arnold, an urban and regional
studies researcher at SRI. He
explained that members of the


FROST FILLED-Around 8000 students, faculty and concerned members of
the Stanford community nearly filled Frost Amphitheater yesterday afternoon
for an unprecedented meeting called by student body president Denis Hayes on
the crisis concerning the Stanford Research Institute and classified research on
campus.
institute reject the Scott Report
"on all grounds."
"We have fought for and we
have won professional autonomy.
We mean it when we say we are
not ready to give up our
autonomy," he said.
Researchers at SRI are
especially upset by the tone of the
report, according to Arnold,
which seems to suggest that they
are "second class citizens."
Arnold also rejected
suggestions by Ezra Solomon,
Dean \Vitter Professor of Finance
in the Business School and a
member of the SRI committee, to
sell SRI with a restrictive
covenant against classified
research or channel its research
into other areas.
"We won't do the unpleasant
research at SRI to see all our extra
funds sent over hen 1 to the
University to support more
interesting projects for the
professors," Arnold said.

remarks appears on page two of
today's Daily.)
Power Lost
Stanford Linear Accelerator
physicist Martin Perl concurred
with his colleagues remarks. But

he noted that the tactics used in
the current protest are
"destroying the prestige and
influence of Stanford University."
Perl also drew from his
experience in organizing scientists
against the Antiballistic Missile
system. "If you want to make
politically effective criticism, then
you will get pushed back," he
said.
"You can't eat a full meal and
be critical. We'll have to start
eating skimpy meals here at
Stanford for a while. But in the
long run, I'm sure it will pay,"
Perl said. He was greeted by a
wild, standing ovation.
Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg said, "I am troubled by
the need to preserve a university
that I used to think was a
community of scholars," he
admitted.
Unrooted Evils
He criticized the April 3
Movement fur thinking that they
would "root out" militarism in
the university.
"I continue to believe that it is
a trivial matter compared with the
issues we are considering,"
Lederberg said. "It is not a root, it
is not even a twig."
"The roots are in the decisions

of the Congress, the President,
and the people not yet
sufficiently educated he
concluded.
Allan Watterman, an electrical
engineer at AEL, askrd the crowd,
"Do you think you're stopping
the war when you stop the work
at AEL?"
"Whenever there is a set of
rules sot up to govern research,
you must realize that this is
literally censorship," ho said.

Lincoln Malik, a graduate
student from Iraq, and member of
the April 3 Coalition, answered
for the Third World and the
crowd's emotion reached a peak
during his fiery speech. Several
times they broke into wild
applause and he received an
enthusiastic ovation.
Malik said that the desire of
the Third World peoples to free

themselves was shown by the
struggles in Vietnam and Latin
America. He added that the
Stanford community had a
choice: to aid the Third World in
its struggle or do nothing and
thereby aid the exploiters.
Rejection of Recommendation
Another speaker was Bob
Arnold, an urban and regional
studies researcher at SRI. He
explained that members of the


FROST FILLED-Around 8000 students, faculty and concerned members of
the Stanford community nearly filled Frost Amphitheater yesterday afternoon
for an unprecedented meeting called by student body president Denis Hayes on
the crisis concerning the Stanford Research Institute and classified research on
campus.
institute reject the Scott Report
"on all grounds."
"We have fought for and we
have won professional autonomy.
We mean it when we say we are
not ready to give up our
autonomy," he said.
Researchers at SRI are
especially upset by the tone of the
report, according to Arnold,
which seems to suggest that they
are "second class citizens."
Arnold also rejected
suggestions by Ezra Solomon,
Dean \Vitter Professor of Finance
in the Business School and a
member of the SRI committee, to
sell SRI with a restrictive
covenant against classified
research or channel its research
into other areas.
"We won't do the unpleasant
research at SRI to see all our extra
funds sent over hen 1 to the
University to support more
interesting projects for the
professors," Arnold said.

remarks appears on page two of

Power Lost
Stanford Linear Accelerator
physicist Martin Perl concurred
with his colleagues remarks. But

he noted that the tactics used in
the current protest are
"destroying the prestige and
influence of Stanford University."
Perl also drew from his
experience in organizing scientists
against the Antiballistic Missile
system. "If you want to make
politically effective criticism, then
you will get pushed back," he
said.
"You can't eat a full meal and
be critical. We'll have to start
eating skimpy meals here at
Stanford for a while. But in the
long run, I'm sure it will pay,"
Perl said. He was greeted by a
wild, standing ovation.
Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg said, "I am troubled by
the need to preserve a university
that I used to think was a
community of scholars," he
admitted.
Unrooted Evils
He criticized the April 3
Movement fur thinking that they
would "root out" militarism in
the university.
"I continue to believe that it is
a trivial matter compared with the
issues we are considering,"
Lederberg said. "It is not a root, it
is not even a twig."
"The roots are in the decisions

of the Congress, the President,
and the people not yet
sufficiently educated he
concluded.
Allan Watterman, an electrical
engineer at AEL, askrd the crowd,
"Do you think you're stopping

you must realize that this is
literally censorship," ho said.
The Black Students Union
(BSU) has demanded tighter ties
between the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) and the University
and unilateral control by a
committee, including at least one
BSU member, of University
research contracts.
The BSU action was part of an
extraordinary rally of
approximately 8,000 members of
the University community called
yesterday afternoon in Frost
Ampitheater by Associated
Students President Denis Hayes.
Political science grad student
Paul Bernstein noted, "We should
look inward to find moral
concerns, and then take actions so
we can respect ourselves as human
beings." His remarks before the
three hour session was adjourned
appeared to summarize the
thoughts of most of the speakers.
Topics Of Discussion
Hayes scheduled the open
campus meeting to discuss the
nature of research carried on at
Stanford, the operation of SRI
and the ramifications of various
suggested alternative
arrangements, and tactics to be

employed in obtaining the
demands of the April 3
Movement.
"SRI should turn to East Palo
Alto to show what we can do
when we do research," BSU
chairman Leo Bazile said midway
through the meeting. Members of
the group marched on the stage to
express their indignation at the
direction of current protest over
war-related research.
Bruce Franklin agreed with the
BSU statement saying that
coercion is the only way that
students can liberate Third World
peoples from this country's
imperialism.
Franklin's remarks were
questioned by Gil Diaz, a junior in
political science, who asked,

"We won't do the unpleasant
research at SRI to see all our extra
funds sent over hen 1 to the
University to support more
interesting projects for the
professors," Arnold said.

Power Lost
Stanford Linear Accelerator
physicist Martin Perl concurred
with his colleagues remarks. But

he noted that the tactics used in
the current protest are
"destroying the prestige and
influence of Stanford University."
Perl also drew from his
experience in organizing scientists
against the Antiballistic Missile
system. "If you want to make
politically effective criticism, then
you will get pushed back," he
said.
"You can't eat a full meal and
be critical. We'll have to start
eating skimpy meals here at
Stanford for a while. But in the
long run, I'm sure it will pay,"
Perl said. He was greeted by a
wild, standing ovation.
Nobel Laureate Joshua
Lederberg said, "I am troubled by
the need to preserve a university
that I used to think was a
community of scholars," he
admitted.
Unrooted Evils
He criticized the April 3
Movement fur thinking that they
would "root out" militarism in
the university.
"I continue to believe that it is
a trivial matter compared with the
issues we are considering,"
Lederberg said. "It is not a root, it
is not even a twig."
"The roots are in the decisions

of the Congress, the President,
and the people not yet
sufficiently educated he
concluded.
Allan Watterman, an electrical
engineer at AEL, askrd the crowd,
"Do you think you're stopping
the war when you stop the work
at AEL?"
"Whenever there is a set of
rules sot up to govern research,
you must realize that this is
literally censorship," ho said.
The Black Students Union
(BSU) has demanded tighter ties
between the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) and the University
and unilateral control by a
committee, including at least one
BSU member, of University
research contracts.
The BSU action was part of an
extraordinary rally of
approximately 8,000 members of
the University community called
yesterday afternoon in Frost
Ampitheater by Associated
Students President Denis Hayes.
Political science grad student
Paul Bernstein noted, "We should
look inward to find moral
concerns, and then take actions so
we can respect ourselves as human
beings." His remarks before the
three hour session was adjourned
appeared to summarize the
thoughts of most of the speakers.
Topics Of Discussion
Hayes scheduled the open
campus meeting to discuss the
nature of research carried on at
Stanford, the operation of SRI
and the ramifications of various
suggested alternative
arrangements, and tactics to be

employed in obtaining the
demands of the April 3
Movement.
"SRI should turn to East Palo
Alto to show what we can do
when we do research," BSU
chairman Leo Bazile said midway
through the meeting. Members of
the group marched on the stage to
express their indignation at the
direction of current protest over
war-related research.
Bruce Franklin agreed with the
BSU statement saying that
coercion is the only way that
students can liberate Third World
peoples from this country's
imperialism.
Franklin's remarks were
questioned by Gil Diaz, a junior in
political science, who asked,
"How do you know that these
people want to be liberated?"
Lincoln Malik, a graduate
student from Iraq, and member of
the April 3 Coalition, answered
for the Third World and the
crowd's emotion reached a peak
during his fiery speech. Several
times they broke into wild
applause and he received an
enthusiastic ovation.
Malik said that the desire of
the Third World peoples to free

themselves was shown by the
struggles in Vietnam and Latin
America. He added that the
Stanford community had a
choice: to aid the Third World in
its struggle or do nothing and
thereby aid the exploiters.
Rejection of Recommendation
Another speaker was Bob
Arnold, an urban and regional
studies researcher at SRI. He
explained that members of the


FROST FILLED-Around 8000 students, faculty and concerned members of
the Stanford community nearly filled Frost Amphitheater yesterday afternoon
for an unprecedented meeting called by student body president Denis Hayes on
the crisis concerning the Stanford Research Institute and classified research on
campus.
institute reject the Scott Report
"on all grounds."
"We have fought for and we
have won professional autonomy.
We mean it when we say we are
not ready to give up our
autonomy," he said.
Researchers at SRI are
especially upset by the tone of the
report, according to Arnold,
which seems to suggest that they
are "second class citizens."
Arnold also rejected
suggestions by Ezra Solomon,
Dean \Vitter Professor of Finance
in the Business School and a
member of the SRI committee, to
sell SRI with a restrictive
covenant against classified
research or channel its research
into other areas.
"We won't do the unpleasant
research at SRI to see all our extra
funds sent over hen 1 to the
University to support more
interesting projects for the
professors," Arnold said.
