# BSU Demands Changes
## Rally Airs Research 
### MICHAEL KUHL KIM THORBURN 
The Black Students Union
(BSU) has demanded tighter ties
between the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) and the University
and unilateral control by a
committee, including at least one
BSU member, of University
research contracts.
The BSU action was part of an
extraordinary rally of
approximately 8,000 members of
the University community called
yesterday afternoon in Frost
Ampitheater by Associated
Students President Denis Hayes.
Political science grad student
Paul Bernstein noted, "We should
look inward to find moral
concerns, and then take actions so
we can respect ourselves as human
beings." His remarks before the
three hour session was adjourned
appeared to summarize the
thoughts of most of the speakers.
Topics Of Discussion
Hayes scheduled the open
campus meeting to discuss the
nature of research carried on at
Stanford, the operation of SRI
and the ramifications of various
suggested alternative
arrangements, and tactics to be

employed in obtaining the
demands of the April 3
Movement.
"SRI should turn to East Palo
Alto to show what we can do
when we do research," BSU
chairman Leo Bazile said midway
through the meeting. Members of
the group marched on the stage to
express their indignation at the
direction of current protest over
war-related research.
Bruce Franklin agreed with the
BSU statement saying that
coercion is the only way that
students can liberate Third World
peoples from this country's
imperialism.
Franklin's remarks were
questioned by Gil Diaz, a junior in
political science, who asked,
"How do you know that these
people want to be liberated?"
Lincoln Malik, a graduate
student from Iraq, and member of
the April 3 Coalition, answered
for the Third World and the
crowd's emotion reached a peak
during his fiery speech. Several
times they broke into wild
applause and he received an
enthusiastic ovation.
Malik said that the desire of
the Third World peoples to free

themselves was shown by the
struggles in Vietnam and Latin
America. He added that the
Stanford community had a
choice: to aid the Third World in
its struggle or do nothing and
thereby aid the exploiters.
Rejection of Recommendation
Another speaker was Bob
Arnold, an urban and regional
studies researcher at SRI. He
explained that members of the


FROST FILLED-Around 8000 students, faculty and concerned members of
the Stanford community nearly filled Frost Amphitheater yesterday afternoon
for an unprecedented meeting called by student body president Denis Hayes on
the crisis concerning the Stanford Research Institute and classified research on
campus.
