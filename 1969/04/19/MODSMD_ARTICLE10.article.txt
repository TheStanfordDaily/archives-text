Senate. One deletion has been made

There are many very difficult
and diffuse problems which face
us today: the war in Vietnam, the
relationship of the University to
SRI, research policy, both
national local, and the capacity of
this campus to govern itself in a
manner to maintain freedom for
its various members. Only the last
subject is on today's agenda.
Others, in so far as they are
within Stanford's competence,
shall be dealt with by the Senate,
by the SRI questionnaire, by
other means of dealing with
problems. Other Academic
Council meetings can be called in
an appropriate manner on other
subjects.
This meeting concerns simply
the capacity of this campus to
govern itself in a manner to
maintain freedom for all its
various members.
Now I prepared some remarks
for this meeting which events of
the last hour fortunately allow me
to change. Nonetheless, I think
that it is wise that I go through
most of what I was going to say,
in order to the best of my
knowledge that this element of
potential coercion at least is not
removed. It appears to be
significantly lessened and
ameliorated, we hope it will not
return but I do not think we have
sufficient assurance to ignore that
aspect.
In terms of the particular
points which are linked to the
sit-in, I should like to relate some
events of which you are well
aware in most events, and add a
personal comment now and then.
Let me start with the
appointment of the committee by
Dr. Glaser last fall to look into the
University-SRI relationship. I was
fully aware of this, campus leaders
approved; and believe the
committee did a careful,
thorough, and thoughtful job.
You may note also the
committee's request for a delay of
the report at the end of the term
so as to allow student

participation.
The SRI Coalition request of
April 4 marks the next point to be
noted. On that date it was
brought to me outside my office
and received prompt attention so
far as they were in my authority
or to refer them promptly to the
trustees which I did insofar as
they were in trustees' authority,
and since actually two of the
points referred to the on-campus,
I referred those immediately to
the Academic Council Committee
on Research Policy and to the
Senate of this body.
As you know there have been
several meetings of that
committee and of the Senate in
response to that petition. These
were all set in motion before the
sit-in. The trustee meeting of
April 8 has had a good deal of
attention. My own statement
made it clear my position on
certain of the underlying
issues—the war and the draft, the
relative priorities of the military
compared to civilian matters of
research and other areas of
activity. I asked for a symbolic
response from the trustees to the
concerns of community
Representatives of both faculty
and students were present at that
occasion and I think it's a fair
summary to say that the trustees
did almost every thing—you can
argue about the exact words
here —but they were very
substantially responsive to the
matters which either I or the
faculty representatives urged or
requested upon them. The
students asked considerably more,
and I would not make the same
representation with respect to
their requests.
There was a meeting in this
room the following evening and I
spoke in an attempt to make clear
that the trustees were concerned
about these matters and were
open to the receipt of information
and views, for the opinion of both
the students and the faculty. I
think in effect it was not in fact
necessary to use coercive tactics in
order to get their attention.
Unfortunately, the sit-in started
later that evening.
I believe you are aware of the
statements I made on April 10
and 11, reminding those sitting in
AEL that they were violating the
campus policy on disruption. On

April 11, I referred the situation
to the Stanford Judicial Council.
The first attempt of the judicial
mechanisms involve the
identification of particular
students who might be brought
before the Council by its ordinary
processes. This was, in effect,
frustrated by the refusal of almost
all the students to be identified.
- I might also mention that
various things that have been
circulated to you that we have a
very special problem in that
particular building, in that it is a
principal repository of federal
government classified documents,
as we are under contractual
obligation to the federal
government to maintain the safety
of those documents that are
within our capacity, and this puts
special pressure and called for a
number of special consultations.
To summarize in a brief
scenario, I would just emphasize
again that we must all keep in
mind the rights of those
legitimately assigned to
occupancy of the AEL or any
other laboratory where research is
going on this campus and
remember that problems do
receive attention on this campus
without involving coercive tactics.
The next point which I would
like particularly to deal with is the
latest action of the SJC which
most of you received in the mail
this morning or read in The Daily
this morning. This was the result
of a second action by the Council
when it found its ordinary
procedures were not effective.
* * #
Let me remind you of what the
findings constituted: the finding
that an emergency situation
existed is a sort of a declaration of
an internal martial law. In other
words, its a declaration that the
ordinary procedure certainly is
inadequate. And there is this
provision within the Judicial
Charter saying that the President
under his residual authority has
responsibility for order and
discipline on campus, might take
emergency procedures in
emergency situations. It consists
of things the President could no
of his own action without activity
at the Judicial Council; however, I
preferred deliberately to use the
Judicial Council as the properly

constituted body on this campus
and was on the basis of their
action that declaration of findings
arose.
Now, to come back to the
suggestions, without going over
them in detail, they made
suggestions that, among other
things, this laboratory and the
areas immediately surrounding it
be declared as closed, as of noon
today, until noon (Friday, April
25) to all persons not specifically
authorized by the president and
for purposes of maintaining
security and and such activity as
that.
They suggested that immediate
sactions be imposed upon those
violating the building closure
order. And it seems,
appropriately, that these would be
appropriately appliable to faculty,
staff or students. In the case of
students, an immediate temporary
suspension pending a review of
the case by the Judicial Council.
They also suggested that in case
persons who were present in
violation of the policy who were
not subject to campus
jurisdiction, that the president in
their case seek a civil injunction to
prohibit such activity and, if
unsuccessful, talk with the district
attorney of Santa Clara County
for the purpose of instituting
appropriate criminal action.
In addition, and I would like to
emphasize this because it is
probably now the most imporatnt
part of their suggestion—that is,
during the remainder of the
current academic quarter the
President may summarily invoke
sanctions under (similar to those
described above) regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus (providing
several conditions are met) which,
in effect, define a sit-in of some
substantial magnitude.
Now, as I said, I think it's of
importance that they were still
considering threats of coercion
but that particular aspect is being
noted carefully. Now, up until
about two hours ago, we faced, in
effect, two options: one was to
call actively to impose these

emergency internal sanctions, as
suggested, with modifications in
detail that I might decide upon
after consulting with the dean of
students and others, including the
campus advisory group on
disruptions (and frankly, I
consulted them usually two or
three times a day all through this
period) or the only other option
was to turn immediately to
external authority. And had this
situation still been before us I
would suggest that that would be
about the only thing before us
would be serious discussion of
which alternative was better.
Let me reiterate that I have
had the very best, most careful,
devoted attention to these
problems from the individuals of
the advisory group on disruptions
and I thank them very sincerely
for essentially completely
devoting themselves to assistance
and advice in this area during this
period and, I may say, all the time
that I've been on this
campus . . . .The same can be said
for the administrative officers, the
provost, the dean of students, and
others who have been particularly
involved.
It seems to me the issue is: can
Stanford control its own affairs?
Can the campus community
govern itself or must it submit
itself to outside authority? The
essence of the university is
freedom to consider ideas. It
should be a bastion of rationality
against the forces of coercion. We
can maintain this freedom only if
we can govern ourselves. Frankly,
when we've asked some of you to
help maintain this freedom
actively by participating in the
course of procedures against those
violating the freedom of others,
the response had not been
anywhere near as good as we
would have liked. I submit that
this is true with respect only to
those particular members of
whom we've made demands; I
must ask all of you now for your
active commitment to this
concept of freedom and campus
independence. This means active
support of the SJC and the other
elements of campus
self-governance.

April 4 marks the next point to be
noted. On that date it was
brought to me outside my office
and received prompt attention so
far as they were in my authority
or to refer them promptly to the
trustees which I did insofar as
they were in trustees' authority,
and since actually two of the
points referred to the on-campus,
I referred those immediately to
the Academic Council Committee
on Research Policy and to the
Senate of this body.
As you know there have been
several meetings of that
committee and of the Senate in
response to that petition. These
were all set in motion before the
sit-in. The trustee meeting of
April 8 has had a good deal of
attention. My own statement
made it clear my position on
certain of the underlying
issues—the war and the draft, the
relative priorities of the military
compared to civilian matters of
research and other areas of
activity. I asked for a symbolic
response from the trustees to the
concerns of community
Representatives of both faculty
and students were present at that
occasion and I think it's a fair
summary to say that the trustees
did almost every thing—you can
argue about the exact words
here —but they were very
substantially responsive to the
matters which either I or the
faculty representatives urged or
requested upon them. The
students asked considerably more,
and I would not make the same
representation with respect to
their requests.
There was a meeting in this
room the following evening and I
spoke in an attempt to make clear
that the trustees were concerned
about these matters and were
open to the receipt of information
and views, for the opinion of both
the students and the faculty. I
think in effect it was not in fact
necessary to use coercive tactics in
order to get their attention.
Unfortunately, the sit-in started
later that evening.
I believe you are aware of the
statements I made on April 10
and 11, reminding those sitting in
AEL that they were violating the
campus policy on disruption. On

April 11, I referred the situation
to the Stanford Judicial Council.
The first attempt of the judicial
mechanisms involve the
identification of particular
students who might be brought
before the Council by its ordinary
processes. This was, in effect,
frustrated by the refusal of almost
all the students to be identified.
- I might also mention that
various things that have been
circulated to you that we have a
very special problem in that
particular building, in that it is a
principal repository of federal
government classified documents,
as we are under contractual
obligation to the federal
government to maintain the safety
of those documents that are
within our capacity, and this puts
special pressure and called for a
number of special consultations.
To summarize in a brief
scenario, I would just emphasize
again that we must all keep in
mind the rights of those
legitimately assigned to
occupancy of the AEL or any
other laboratory where research is
going on this campus and
remember that problems do
receive attention on this campus
without involving coercive tactics.
The next point which I would
like particularly to deal with is the
latest action of the SJC which
most of you received in the mail
this morning or read in The Daily
this morning. This was the result
of a second action by the Council
when it found its ordinary
procedures were not effective.
* * #
Let me remind you of what the
findings constituted: the finding
that an emergency situation
existed is a sort of a declaration of
an internal martial law. In other
words, its a declaration that the
ordinary procedure certainly is
inadequate. And there is this
provision within the Judicial
Charter saying that the President
under his residual authority has
responsibility for order and
discipline on campus, might take
emergency procedures in
emergency situations. It consists
of things the President could no
of his own action without activity
at the Judicial Council; however, I
preferred deliberately to use the
Judicial Council as the properly

constituted body on this campus
and was on the basis of their
action that declaration of findings
arose.
Now, to come back to the
suggestions, without going over
them in detail, they made
suggestions that, among other
things, this laboratory and the
areas immediately surrounding it
be declared as closed, as of noon
today, until noon (Friday, April
25) to all persons not specifically
authorized by the president and
for purposes of maintaining
security and and such activity as
that.
They suggested that immediate
sactions be imposed upon those
violating the building closure
order. And it seems,
appropriately, that these would be
appropriately appliable to faculty,
staff or students. In the case of
students, an immediate temporary
suspension pending a review of
the case by the Judicial Council.
They also suggested that in case
persons who were present in
violation of the policy who were
not subject to campus
jurisdiction, that the president in
their case seek a civil injunction to
prohibit such activity and, if
unsuccessful, talk with the district
attorney of Santa Clara County
for the purpose of instituting
appropriate criminal action.
In addition, and I would like to
emphasize this because it is
probably now the most imporatnt
part of their suggestion—that is,
during the remainder of the
current academic quarter the
President may summarily invoke
sanctions under (similar to those
described above) regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus (providing
several conditions are met) which,
in effect, define a sit-in of some
substantial magnitude.
Now, as I said, I think it's of
importance that they were still
considering threats of coercion
but that particular aspect is being
noted carefully. Now, up until
about two hours ago, we faced, in
effect, two options: one was to
call actively to impose these

emergency internal sanctions, as
suggested, with modifications in
detail that I might decide upon
after consulting with the dean of
students and others, including the
campus advisory group on
disruptions (and frankly, I
consulted them usually two or
three times a day all through this
period) or the only other option
was to turn immediately to
external authority. And had this
situation still been before us I
would suggest that that would be
about the only thing before us
would be serious discussion of
which alternative was better.
Let me reiterate that I have
had the very best, most careful,
devoted attention to these
problems from the individuals of
the advisory group on disruptions
and I thank them very sincerely
for essentially completely
devoting themselves to assistance
and advice in this area during this
period and, I may say, all the time
that I've been on this
campus . . . .The same can be said
for the administrative officers, the
provost, the dean of students, and
others who have been particularly
involved.
It seems to me the issue is: can
Stanford control its own affairs?
Can the campus community
govern itself or must it submit
itself to outside authority? The
essence of the university is
freedom to consider ideas. It
should be a bastion of rationality
against the forces of coercion. We
can maintain this freedom only if
we can govern ourselves. Frankly,
when we've asked some of you to
help maintain this freedom
actively by participating in the
course of procedures against those
violating the freedom of others,
the response had not been
anywhere near as good as we
would have liked. I submit that
this is true with respect only to
those particular members of
whom we've made demands; I
must ask all of you now for your
active commitment to this
concept of freedom and campus
independence. This means active
support of the SJC and the other
elements of campus
self-governance.

President Pitzer's comments to
yesterday's meeting of the Academic
Senate. One deletion has been made
and marked with asteriks. At that
point Pitzer read the text of the
Judicial Council's rulings. Since they
were printed in yesterday's DAILY,
they are omitted here.)
There are many very difficult
and diffuse problems which face
us today: the war in Vietnam, the
relationship of the University to
SRI, research policy, both
national local, and the capacity of
this campus to govern itself in a
manner to maintain freedom for
its various members. Only the last
subject is on today's agenda.
Others, in so far as they are
within Stanford's competence,
shall be dealt with by the Senate,
by the SRI questionnaire, by
other means of dealing with
problems. Other Academic
Council meetings can be called in
an appropriate manner on other
subjects.
This meeting concerns simply
the capacity of this campus to
govern itself in a manner to
maintain freedom for all its
various members.
Now I prepared some remarks
for this meeting which events of
the last hour fortunately allow me
to change. Nonetheless, I think
that it is wise that I go through
most of what I was going to say,
in order to the best of my
knowledge that this element of
potential coercion at least is not
removed. It appears to be
significantly lessened and
ameliorated, we hope it will not
return but I do not think we have
sufficient assurance to ignore that
aspect.
In terms of the particular
points which are linked to the
sit-in, I should like to relate some
events of which you are well
aware in most events, and add a
personal comment now and then.
Let me start with the
appointment of the committee by
Dr. Glaser last fall to look into the
University-SRI relationship. I was
fully aware of this, campus leaders
approved; and believe the
committee did a careful,
thorough, and thoughtful job.
You may note also the
committee's request for a delay of
the report at the end of the term
so as to allow student

participation.
The SRI Coalition request of
April 4 marks the next point to be
noted. On that date it was

processes. This was, in effect,
frustrated by the refusal of almost
all the students to be identified.
- I might also mention that
various things that have been
circulated to you that we have a
very special problem in that
particular building, in that it is a
principal repository of federal
government classified documents,
as we are under contractual
obligation to the federal
government to maintain the safety
of those documents that are
within our capacity, and this puts
special pressure and called for a
number of special consultations.
To summarize in a brief
scenario, I would just emphasize
again that we must all keep in
mind the rights of those
legitimately assigned to
occupancy of the AEL or any
other laboratory where research is
going on this campus and
remember that problems do
receive attention on this campus
without involving coercive tactics.
The next point which I would
like particularly to deal with is the
latest action of the SJC which
most of you received in the mail
this morning or read in The Daily
this morning. This was the result
of a second action by the Council
when it found its ordinary
procedures were not effective.
* * #
Let me remind you of what the
findings constituted: the finding
that an emergency situation
existed is a sort of a declaration of
an internal martial law. In other
words, its a declaration that the
ordinary procedure certainly is
inadequate. And there is this
provision within the Judicial
Charter saying that the President
under his residual authority has
responsibility for order and
discipline on campus, might take
emergency procedures in
emergency situations. It consists
of things the President could no
of his own action without activity
at the Judicial Council; however, I
preferred deliberately to use the
Judicial Council as the properly

constituted body on this campus
and was on the basis of their
action that declaration of findings
arose.
Now, to come back to the
suggestions, without going over
them in detail, they made
suggestions that, among other
things, this laboratory and the
areas immediately surrounding it
be declared as closed, as of noon
today, until noon (Friday, April
25) to all persons not specifically
authorized by the president and
for purposes of maintaining
security and and such activity as
that.
They suggested that immediate
sactions be imposed upon those
violating the building closure
order. And it seems,
appropriately, that these would be
appropriately appliable to faculty,
staff or students. In the case of
students, an immediate temporary
suspension pending a review of
the case by the Judicial Council.
They also suggested that in case
persons who were present in
violation of the policy who were
not subject to campus
jurisdiction, that the president in
their case seek a civil injunction to
prohibit such activity and, if
unsuccessful, talk with the district
attorney of Santa Clara County
for the purpose of instituting
appropriate criminal action.
In addition, and I would like to
emphasize this because it is
probably now the most imporatnt
part of their suggestion—that is,
during the remainder of the
current academic quarter the
President may summarily invoke
sanctions under (similar to those
described above) regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus (providing
several conditions are met) which,
in effect, define a sit-in of some
substantial magnitude.
Now, as I said, I think it's of
importance that they were still
considering threats of coercion
but that particular aspect is being
noted carefully. Now, up until
about two hours ago, we faced, in
effect, two options: one was to
call actively to impose these

emergency internal sanctions, as
suggested, with modifications in
detail that I might decide upon
after consulting with the dean of
students and others, including the
campus advisory group on
disruptions (and frankly, I
consulted them usually two or
three times a day all through this
period) or the only other option
was to turn immediately to
external authority. And had this
situation still been before us I
would suggest that that would be
about the only thing before us
would be serious discussion of
which alternative was better.
Let me reiterate that I have
had the very best, most careful,
devoted attention to these
problems from the individuals of
the advisory group on disruptions
and I thank them very sincerely
for essentially completely
devoting themselves to assistance
and advice in this area during this
period and, I may say, all the time
that I've been on this
campus . . . .The same can be said
for the administrative officers, the
provost, the dean of students, and
others who have been particularly
involved.
It seems to me the issue is: can
Stanford control its own affairs?
Can the campus community
govern itself or must it submit
itself to outside authority? The
essence of the university is
freedom to consider ideas. It
should be a bastion of rationality
against the forces of coercion. We
can maintain this freedom only if
we can govern ourselves. Frankly,
when we've asked some of you to
help maintain this freedom
actively by participating in the
course of procedures against those
violating the freedom of others,
the response had not been
anywhere near as good as we
would have liked. I submit that
this is true with respect only to
those particular members of
whom we've made demands; I
must ask all of you now for your
active commitment to this
concept of freedom and campus
independence. This means active
support of the SJC and the other
elements of campus
self-governance.

President Pitzer's comments to
yesterday's meeting of the Academic
Senate. One deletion has been made

point Pitzer read the text of the

were printed in yesterday's DAILY,

There are many very difficult
and diffuse problems which face
us today: the war in Vietnam, the
relationship of the University to
SRI, research policy, both
national local, and the capacity of
this campus to govern itself in a
manner to maintain freedom for
its various members. Only the last
subject is on today's agenda.
Others, in so far as they are
within Stanford's competence,
shall be dealt with by the Senate,
by the SRI questionnaire, by
other means of dealing with
problems. Other Academic
Council meetings can be called in
an appropriate manner on other
subjects.
This meeting concerns simply
the capacity of this campus to
govern itself in a manner to
maintain freedom for all its
various members.
Now I prepared some remarks
for this meeting which events of
the last hour fortunately allow me
to change. Nonetheless, I think
that it is wise that I go through
most of what I was going to say,
in order to the best of my
knowledge that this element of
potential coercion at least is not
removed. It appears to be
significantly lessened and
ameliorated, we hope it will not
return but I do not think we have
sufficient assurance to ignore that
aspect.
In terms of the particular
points which are linked to the
sit-in, I should like to relate some
events of which you are well
aware in most events, and add a
personal comment now and then.
Let me start with the
appointment of the committee by
Dr. Glaser last fall to look into the
University-SRI relationship. I was
fully aware of this, campus leaders
approved; and believe the
committee did a careful,
thorough, and thoughtful job.
You may note also the
committee's request for a delay of
the report at the end of the term
so as to allow student

participation.
The SRI Coalition request of
April 4 marks the next point to be
noted. On that date it was
brought to me outside my office
and received prompt attention so
far as they were in my authority
or to refer them promptly to the
trustees which I did insofar as
they were in trustees' authority,
and since actually two of the
points referred to the on-campus,
I referred those immediately to
the Academic Council Committee
on Research Policy and to the
Senate of this body.
As you know there have been
several meetings of that
committee and of the Senate in
response to that petition. These
were all set in motion before the
sit-in. The trustee meeting of
April 8 has had a good deal of
attention. My own statement
made it clear my position on
certain of the underlying
issues—the war and the draft, the
relative priorities of the military
compared to civilian matters of
research and other areas of
activity. I asked for a symbolic
response from the trustees to the
concerns of community
Representatives of both faculty
and students were present at that
occasion and I think it's a fair
summary to say that the trustees
did almost every thing—you can
argue about the exact words
here —but they were very
substantially responsive to the
matters which either I or the
faculty representatives urged or
requested upon them. The
students asked considerably more,
and I would not make the same
representation with respect to
their requests.
There was a meeting in this
room the following evening and I
spoke in an attempt to make clear
that the trustees were concerned
about these matters and were
open to the receipt of information
and views, for the opinion of both
the students and the faculty. I
think in effect it was not in fact
necessary to use coercive tactics in
order to get their attention.
Unfortunately, the sit-in started
later that evening.
I believe you are aware of the
statements I made on April 10
and 11, reminding those sitting in
AEL that they were violating the
campus policy on disruption. On

April 11, I referred the situation
to the Stanford Judicial Council.
The first attempt of the judicial
mechanisms involve the
identification of particular
students who might be brought
before the Council by its ordinary
processes. This was, in effect,
frustrated by the refusal of almost
all the students to be identified.
- I might also mention that
various things that have been
circulated to you that we have a
very special problem in that

that.
They suggested that immediate
sactions be imposed upon those
violating the building closure
order. And it seems,
appropriately, that these would be
appropriately appliable to faculty,
staff or students. In the case of
students, an immediate temporary
suspension pending a review of
the case by the Judicial Council.
They also suggested that in case
persons who were present in
violation of the policy who were
not subject to campus
jurisdiction, that the president in
their case seek a civil injunction to
prohibit such activity and, if
unsuccessful, talk with the district
attorney of Santa Clara County
for the purpose of instituting
appropriate criminal action.
In addition, and I would like to
emphasize this because it is
probably now the most imporatnt
part of their suggestion—that is,
during the remainder of the
current academic quarter the
President may summarily invoke
sanctions under (similar to those
described above) regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus (providing
several conditions are met) which,
in effect, define a sit-in of some
substantial magnitude.
Now, as I said, I think it's of
importance that they were still
considering threats of coercion
but that particular aspect is being
noted carefully. Now, up until
about two hours ago, we faced, in
effect, two options: one was to
call actively to impose these

emergency internal sanctions, as
suggested, with modifications in
detail that I might decide upon
after consulting with the dean of
students and others, including the
campus advisory group on
disruptions (and frankly, I
consulted them usually two or
three times a day all through this
period) or the only other option
was to turn immediately to
external authority. And had this
situation still been before us I
would suggest that that would be
about the only thing before us
would be serious discussion of
which alternative was better.
Let me reiterate that I have
had the very best, most careful,
devoted attention to these
problems from the individuals of
the advisory group on disruptions
and I thank them very sincerely
for essentially completely
devoting themselves to assistance
and advice in this area during this
period and, I may say, all the time
that I've been on this
campus . . . .The same can be said
for the administrative officers, the
provost, the dean of students, and
others who have been particularly
involved.
It seems to me the issue is: can
Stanford control its own affairs?
Can the campus community
govern itself or must it submit
itself to outside authority? The
essence of the university is
freedom to consider ideas. It
should be a bastion of rationality
against the forces of coercion. We
can maintain this freedom only if
we can govern ourselves. Frankly,
when we've asked some of you to
help maintain this freedom
actively by participating in the
course of procedures against those
violating the freedom of others,
the response had not been
anywhere near as good as we
would have liked. I submit that
this is true with respect only to
those particular members of
whom we've made demands; I
must ask all of you now for your
active commitment to this
concept of freedom and campus
independence. This means active
support of the SJC and the other
elements of campus
self-governance.

Senate. One deletion has been made

There are many very difficult
and diffuse problems which face
us today: the war in Vietnam, the
relationship of the University to
SRI, research policy, both
national local, and the capacity of
this campus to govern itself in a
manner to maintain freedom for
its various members. Only the last
subject is on today's agenda.
Others, in so far as they are
within Stanford's competence,
shall be dealt with by the Senate,
by the SRI questionnaire, by
other means of dealing with
problems. Other Academic
Council meetings can be called in
an appropriate manner on other
subjects.
This meeting concerns simply
the capacity of this campus to
govern itself in a manner to
maintain freedom for all its
various members.
Now I prepared some remarks
for this meeting which events of
the last hour fortunately allow me
to change. Nonetheless, I think
that it is wise that I go through
most of what I was going to say,
in order to the best of my
knowledge that this element of
potential coercion at least is not
removed. It appears to be
significantly lessened and
ameliorated, we hope it will not
return but I do not think we have
sufficient assurance to ignore that
aspect.
In terms of the particular
points which are linked to the
sit-in, I should like to relate some
events of which you are well
aware in most events, and add a
personal comment now and then.
Let me start with the
appointment of the committee by
Dr. Glaser last fall to look into the
University-SRI relationship. I was
fully aware of this, campus leaders
approved; and believe the
committee did a careful,
thorough, and thoughtful job.
You may note also the
committee's request for a delay of
the report at the end of the term
so as to allow student

participation.
The SRI Coalition request of
April 4 marks the next point to be
noted. On that date it was
brought to me outside my office
and received prompt attention so
far as they were in my authority
or to refer them promptly to the
trustees which I did insofar as
they were in trustees' authority,
and since actually two of the
points referred to the on-campus,
I referred those immediately to
the Academic Council Committee
on Research Policy and to the
Senate of this body.
As you know there have been
several meetings of that
committee and of the Senate in
response to that petition. These
were all set in motion before the
sit-in. The trustee meeting of
April 8 has had a good deal of
attention. My own statement
made it clear my position on
certain of the underlying
issues—the war and the draft, the
relative priorities of the military
compared to civilian matters of
research and other areas of
activity. I asked for a symbolic
response from the trustees to the
concerns of community
Representatives of both faculty
and students were present at that
occasion and I think it's a fair
summary to say that the trustees
did almost every thing—you can
argue about the exact words
here —but they were very
substantially responsive to the
matters which either I or the
faculty representatives urged or
requested upon them. The
students asked considerably more,
and I would not make the same
representation with respect to
their requests.
There was a meeting in this
room the following evening and I
spoke in an attempt to make clear
that the trustees were concerned
about these matters and were
open to the receipt of information
and views, for the opinion of both
the students and the faculty. I
think in effect it was not in fact
necessary to use coercive tactics in
order to get their attention.
Unfortunately, the sit-in started
later that evening.
I believe you are aware of the
statements I made on April 10
and 11, reminding those sitting in
AEL that they were violating the
campus policy on disruption. On

April 11, I referred the situation
to the Stanford Judicial Council.
The first attempt of the judicial
mechanisms involve the
identification of particular
students who might be brought
before the Council by its ordinary
processes. This was, in effect,
frustrated by the refusal of almost
all the students to be identified.
- I might also mention that
various things that have been
circulated to you that we have a
very special problem in that
particular building, in that it is a
principal repository of federal
government classified documents,
as we are under contractual
obligation to the federal
government to maintain the safety
of those documents that are
within our capacity, and this puts
special pressure and called for a
number of special consultations.
To summarize in a brief
scenario, I would just emphasize
again that we must all keep in
mind the rights of those
legitimately assigned to
occupancy of the AEL or any
other laboratory where research is
going on this campus and
remember that problems do
receive attention on this campus
without involving coercive tactics.
The next point which I would
like particularly to deal with is the
latest action of the SJC which
most of you received in the mail
this morning or read in The Daily
this morning. This was the result
of a second action by the Council
when it found its ordinary
procedures were not effective.
* * #
Let me remind you of what the
findings constituted: the finding
that an emergency situation
existed is a sort of a declaration of
an internal martial law. In other
words, its a declaration that the
ordinary procedure certainly is
inadequate. And there is this
provision within the Judicial
Charter saying that the President
under his residual authority has
responsibility for order and
discipline on campus, might take
emergency procedures in
emergency situations. It consists
of things the President could no
of his own action without activity
at the Judicial Council; however, I
preferred deliberately to use the
Judicial Council as the properly

constituted body on this campus
and was on the basis of their
action that declaration of findings
arose.
Now, to come back to the
suggestions, without going over
them in detail, they made
suggestions that, among other
things, this laboratory and the
areas immediately surrounding it
be declared as closed, as of noon
today, until noon (Friday, April
25) to all persons not specifically
authorized by the president and
for purposes of maintaining
security and and such activity as
that.
They suggested that immediate
sactions be imposed upon those
violating the building closure
order. And it seems,
appropriately, that these would be
appropriately appliable to faculty,
staff or students. In the case of
students, an immediate temporary
suspension pending a review of

that I've been on this
campus . . . .The same can be said
for the administrative officers, the
provost, the dean of students, and
others who have been particularly
involved.
It seems to me the issue is: can
Stanford control its own affairs?
Can the campus community
govern itself or must it submit
itself to outside authority? The
essence of the university is
freedom to consider ideas. It
should be a bastion of rationality
against the forces of coercion. We
can maintain this freedom only if
we can govern ourselves. Frankly,
when we've asked some of you to
help maintain this freedom
actively by participating in the
course of procedures against those
violating the freedom of others,
the response had not been
anywhere near as good as we
would have liked. I submit that
this is true with respect only to
those particular members of
whom we've made demands; I
must ask all of you now for your
active commitment to this
concept of freedom and campus
independence. This means active
support of the SJC and the other
elements of campus
self-governance.
(The following is a transcript of
President Pitzer's comments to
yesterday's meeting of the Academic
Senate. One deletion has been made
and marked with asteriks. At that
point Pitzer read the text of the
Judicial Council's rulings. Since they
were printed in yesterday's DAILY,
they are omitted here.)
There are many very difficult
and diffuse problems which face
us today: the war in Vietnam, the
relationship of the University to
SRI, research policy, both
national local, and the capacity of
this campus to govern itself in a
manner to maintain freedom for
its various members. Only the last
subject is on today's agenda.
Others, in so far as they are
within Stanford's competence,
shall be dealt with by the Senate,
by the SRI questionnaire, by
other means of dealing with
problems. Other Academic
Council meetings can be called in
an appropriate manner on other
subjects.
This meeting concerns simply
the capacity of this campus to
govern itself in a manner to
maintain freedom for all its
various members.
Now I prepared some remarks
for this meeting which events of
the last hour fortunately allow me
to change. Nonetheless, I think
that it is wise that I go through
most of what I was going to say,
in order to the best of my
knowledge that this element of
potential coercion at least is not
removed. It appears to be
significantly lessened and
ameliorated, we hope it will not
return but I do not think we have
sufficient assurance to ignore that
aspect.
In terms of the particular
points which are linked to the
sit-in, I should like to relate some
events of which you are well
aware in most events, and add a
personal comment now and then.
Let me start with the
appointment of the committee by
Dr. Glaser last fall to look into the
University-SRI relationship. I was
fully aware of this, campus leaders
approved; and believe the
committee did a careful,
thorough, and thoughtful job.
You may note also the
committee's request for a delay of
the report at the end of the term
so as to allow student

participation.
The SRI Coalition request of
April 4 marks the next point to be
noted. On that date it was
brought to me outside my office
and received prompt attention so
far as they were in my authority
or to refer them promptly to the
trustees which I did insofar as
they were in trustees' authority,
and since actually two of the
points referred to the on-campus,
I referred those immediately to
the Academic Council Committee
on Research Policy and to the
Senate of this body.
As you know there have been
several meetings of that
committee and of the Senate in
response to that petition. These
were all set in motion before the
sit-in. The trustee meeting of
April 8 has had a good deal of
attention. My own statement
made it clear my position on
certain of the underlying
issues—the war and the draft, the
relative priorities of the military
compared to civilian matters of
research and other areas of
activity. I asked for a symbolic
response from the trustees to the
concerns of community
Representatives of both faculty
and students were present at that
occasion and I think it's a fair
summary to say that the trustees
did almost every thing—you can
argue about the exact words
here —but they were very
substantially responsive to the
matters which either I or the
faculty representatives urged or
requested upon them. The
students asked considerably more,
and I would not make the same
representation with respect to
their requests.
There was a meeting in this
room the following evening and I
spoke in an attempt to make clear
that the trustees were concerned
about these matters and were
open to the receipt of information
and views, for the opinion of both
the students and the faculty. I
think in effect it was not in fact
necessary to use coercive tactics in
order to get their attention.
Unfortunately, the sit-in started
later that evening.
I believe you are aware of the
statements I made on April 10
and 11, reminding those sitting in
AEL that they were violating the
campus policy on disruption. On

April 11, I referred the situation
to the Stanford Judicial Council.
The first attempt of the judicial
mechanisms involve the
identification of particular
students who might be brought
before the Council by its ordinary
processes. This was, in effect,
frustrated by the refusal of almost
all the students to be identified.
- I might also mention that
various things that have been
circulated to you that we have a
very special problem in that
particular building, in that it is a
principal repository of federal
government classified documents,
as we are under contractual
obligation to the federal
government to maintain the safety
of those documents that are
within our capacity, and this puts
special pressure and called for a
number of special consultations.
To summarize in a brief
scenario, I would just emphasize
again that we must all keep in
mind the rights of those
legitimately assigned to
occupancy of the AEL or any
other laboratory where research is
going on this campus and
remember that problems do
receive attention on this campus
without involving coercive tactics.
The next point which I would
like particularly to deal with is the
latest action of the SJC which
most of you received in the mail
this morning or read in The Daily
this morning. This was the result
of a second action by the Council
when it found its ordinary
procedures were not effective.
* * #
Let me remind you of what the
findings constituted: the finding
that an emergency situation
existed is a sort of a declaration of
an internal martial law. In other
words, its a declaration that the
ordinary procedure certainly is
inadequate. And there is this
provision within the Judicial
Charter saying that the President
under his residual authority has
responsibility for order and
discipline on campus, might take
emergency procedures in
emergency situations. It consists
of things the President could no
of his own action without activity
at the Judicial Council; however, I
preferred deliberately to use the
Judicial Council as the properly

constituted body on this campus
and was on the basis of their
action that declaration of findings
arose.
Now, to come back to the
suggestions, without going over
them in detail, they made
suggestions that, among other
things, this laboratory and the
areas immediately surrounding it
be declared as closed, as of noon
today, until noon (Friday, April
25) to all persons not specifically
authorized by the president and
for purposes of maintaining
security and and such activity as
that.
They suggested that immediate
sactions be imposed upon those
violating the building closure
order. And it seems,
appropriately, that these would be
appropriately appliable to faculty,
staff or students. In the case of
students, an immediate temporary
suspension pending a review of
the case by the Judicial Council.
They also suggested that in case
persons who were present in
violation of the policy who were
not subject to campus
jurisdiction, that the president in
their case seek a civil injunction to
prohibit such activity and, if
unsuccessful, talk with the district
attorney of Santa Clara County
for the purpose of instituting
appropriate criminal action.
In addition, and I would like to
emphasize this because it is
probably now the most imporatnt
part of their suggestion—that is,
during the remainder of the
current academic quarter the
President may summarily invoke
sanctions under (similar to those
described above) regarding any
member of the campus
community who is in occupation
of any other building on the
Stanford campus (providing
several conditions are met) which,
in effect, define a sit-in of some
substantial magnitude.
Now, as I said, I think it's of
importance that they were still
considering threats of coercion
but that particular aspect is being
noted carefully. Now, up until
about two hours ago, we faced, in
effect, two options: one was to
call actively to impose these

emergency internal sanctions, as
suggested, with modifications in
detail that I might decide upon
after consulting with the dean of
students and others, including the
campus advisory group on
disruptions (and frankly, I
consulted them usually two or
three times a day all through this
period) or the only other option
was to turn immediately to
external authority. And had this
situation still been before us I
would suggest that that would be
about the only thing before us
would be serious discussion of
which alternative was better.
Let me reiterate that I have
had the very best, most careful,
devoted attention to these
problems from the individuals of
the advisory group on disruptions
and I thank them very sincerely
for essentially completely
devoting themselves to assistance
and advice in this area during this
period and, I may say, all the time
that I've been on this
campus . . . .The same can be said
for the administrative officers, the
provost, the dean of students, and
others who have been particularly
involved.
It seems to me the issue is: can
Stanford control its own affairs?
Can the campus community
govern itself or must it submit
itself to outside authority? The
essence of the university is
freedom to consider ideas. It
should be a bastion of rationality
against the forces of coercion. We
can maintain this freedom only if
we can govern ourselves. Frankly,
when we've asked some of you to
help maintain this freedom
actively by participating in the
course of procedures against those
violating the freedom of others,
the response had not been
anywhere near as good as we
would have liked. I submit that
this is true with respect only to
those particular members of
whom we've made demands; I
must ask all of you now for your
active commitment to this
concept of freedom and campus
independence. This means active
support of the SJC and the other
elements of campus
self-governance.
