# Academic Senate Chairman Defends Body's Crisis Role
## 
### 
(The following statement of Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff was
prepared as a response to criticism of
the role of the Academic Senate in the
current crisis confronting the
University.)
There are some in the Stanford
community who are saying that
the Academic Senate has taken a
weak stand on the research issues
currently under discussion on the
campus. Statements such as these
are damaging to efforts to solve
present problems. Let us look at
the record:
The Senate has been very
responsive to the concerns
expressed by an overwhelming
majority of the Stanford
Community, including the April 3
Coalition. This is shown by
actions taken at meetings on Apr.
10 and Apr. 15, and by the
agenda for additional meetings
scheduled for Apr. 22 and Apr.
24. Two of these four meetings
are special meetings.
At its Apr. 10 meeting, the
Senate took the strongest action
that it could take with respect to
SRI-University relations, in view
of the fact that it has no control
over SRI research activities. The
Senate urgently requested that as
many trustees as possible attend
the open hearing to be held on
campus this month, and also

urgently requested that the Board
of Trustees report fully to the
Stanford Community the results
of its discussions concerning the
SRI-University relationship by
mid-May. Further, the Senate
scheduled a special meeting to be
held on Apr. 22 to review the
report of the Ad Hoc Committee
on the SRI-University
relationship.
At its Apr. 15 meeting, the
Senate took strong action with
respect to policy guidelines for
research on campus, in two
important, respects.
First, it directed the
Committee on Research Policy to
prepare new research policy
guidelines which would prohibit
research which involves secrecy of
sponsorship or results, and
directed that the Committee
present these to the Senate at its
Apr. 24 meeting. This meeting
will consider the matter of these
guidelines, even if the
Committee's report is not received
by then.
Second, the Senate went, on
record as favoring a further
reordering of our own research
priorities, and (what is perhaps
more important) a reordering of
research priorities of those federal
government agencies that sponsor
research.

The facts that the Apr. 15
meeting had nearly full
attendance and that there was
only one dissenting vote on the
final resolution, strongly suggest
that actions to be taken along
these lines with respect to
research guidelines and priorities
will be sustained by the full
Academic Council.
It is also important to note
that the Senate has taken a strong
moral stand on the issue of
war-related research versus
research directed toward peace
and human welfare. This is far
more meaningful than a hasty
attempt to specify precisely what
is meant by counter-insurgency
research and then rule it out of
bounds. With regard to chemical,
biological, and radiological
warfare, the Senate has been
assured by the University's
Research Administrator that there
is no such activity on the campus.
I regard it as of the greatest
importance that persons in the
Stanford Community who share
the Senate's concern with these
matters appreciate to the fullest
extent thÂ«> very strong and
positive actions taken and
attitudes expressed by the
Academic Senate in its role as the
official representative of the
Stanford Faculty.
