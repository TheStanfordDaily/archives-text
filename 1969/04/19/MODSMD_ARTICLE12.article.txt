# Law Students Say Covenant No Good
## 
### 
A restrictive covenant on the
sale of SRI won't work, say a
group of law students who plan to
issue a report to the community
today.
The law students say they will
show that the majority report of
the SRI Study Committee,
released last Tuesday, is defective
because it relies on an untested,
dubious covenant to bar CBW and
counterinsurgency research after
SRI is sold.
Henry Killeen, one of the
students, announced the group's
plans during a noon rally in White
Plaza yesterday. He said that the
group has consulted with several
law faculty in the preparation of
the forthcoming report.
Killeen described two of the
problems with a covenant. First, it
could be enforced in the courts
only by voluntary action of the
Board of Trustees. Second, the
complex kind of covenant on the
sale of SRI which is needed, while
"intellectually conceivably," has
no clear legal precedent and may
or may not be workable.
Killeen urged all those at the
rally to obtain a copy of the
group's report, when it is issued,
arid study it before voting in the
SRI referendum.
The idea of a restrictive
covenant to prohibit certain kinds
of research at SRI after it is sold is
advanced in the majority report
endorsed by seven ol the 12

members.
A separate statement argues
that SRI should be sold in order
to earn an estimated $35 million
from the sale, and that no
restrictive covenant should be
made. The committee's chairman,
Law Prof. Ken Scott, and Provost
Richard Lyman, signed this
statement.
Scott's and Lyman's statement
also throws doubt on the idea of a
restrictive covenant. They state:
"It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
clause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and as
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
of the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
what is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
upon precision of thought."
Two minority statements of
the report argue forcefully that
SRI should not be severed, and
that the questions of kinds of
research at SRI be handled within
the Stanford-SRI community.

that SRI should be sold in order
to earn an estimated $35 million
from the sale, and that no
restrictive covenant should be
made. The committee's chairman,
Law Prof. Ken Scott, and Provost
Richard Lyman, signed this
statement.
Scott's and Lyman's statement
also throws doubt on the idea of a
restrictive covenant. They state:
"It is quite possible to design a
research-limiting agreement clause
about which it may then be said
that doubt exists —or has been
created. A legal opinion that is
worth anything, therefore, would
have to be rendered after
extensive research and with
reference to a specific draft
clause, hopefully one that has
been drawn as exactly and as
carefully as possible. But this
should cause no one to lose sight
of the fact that it is also possible
to draw a limitation agreement as
to which there would be no
substantial legal doubt, if that is
what is desired. The key factor
would be precision of
expression—and that depends
upon precision of thought."
Two minority statements of
the report argue forcefully that
SRI should not be severed, and
that the questions of kinds of
research at SRI be handled within
the Stanford-SRI community.
A restrictive covenant on the
sale of SRI won't work, say a
group of law students who plan to
issue a report to the community
today.
The law students say they will
show that the majority report of
the SRI Study Committee,
released last Tuesday, is defective
because it relies on an untested,
dubious covenant to bar CBW and
counterinsurgency research after
SRI is sold.
Henry Killeen, one of the
students, announced the group's
plans during a noon rally in White
Plaza yesterday. He said that the
group has consulted with several
law faculty in the preparation of
the forthcoming report.
Killeen described two of the
problems with a covenant. First, it
could be enforced in the courts
only by voluntary action of the
Board of Trustees. Second, the
complex kind of covenant on the
sale of SRI which is needed, while
"intellectually conceivably," has
no clear legal precedent and may
or may not be workable.
Killeen urged all those at the
rally to obtain a copy of the
group's report, when it is issued,
arid study it before voting in the
SRI referendum.
The idea of a restrictive
covenant to prohibit certain kinds
of research at SRI after it is sold is
advanced in the majority report
endorsed by seven ol the 12

members.
A separate statement argues
that SRI should be sold in order
to earn an estimated $35 million
from the sale, and that no
restrictive covenant should be
made. The committee's chairman,

Richard Lyman, signed this
statement.
