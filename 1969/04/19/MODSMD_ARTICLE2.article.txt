# Engineers Hear Prof Say Academic Freedom In Danger
## 
### 
More than 400 engineering
students and faculty attended a 4
p.m. meeting in Cubberley
Auditorium yesterday afternoon
on "Research and Academic
Freedom at Stanford."
The near-capacity crowd heard
electrical engineering professor
Hubert Heffner warn that
"Academic freedom is not a law
but an idea, and it is terribly
fragile." It is now under attack at
universities in a variety of ways,
he said.
"There is the attempt to

change the course of universities
by intimidation and coercion,
which can draw attention but not
real change. The 'research
immorality' charge involves
creation of a 'research goon
squad," he said, "to tell you
whether your research is moral or
not.
"You're going to be in position
of influence and will be able to do
something about the priorities of
research here and throughout the
U. 5.," he told the students. "What
we need more than emotion is

rationality. Use it and we'll move
toward our goals without
destroying what we have now."
"There are two important
things we in the U.S. have that
another large country, namely the
USSR, doesn't," Shockley said.
"Those are free speech and a
functioning secret ballot."
He also noted that the junction
transistor he helped invent was
first used in proximity fuses for
shells. It is now used in hearing
aids.
