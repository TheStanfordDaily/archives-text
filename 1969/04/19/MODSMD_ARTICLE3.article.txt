# Protesters End Sit-In, Faculty Praise Pitzer
## 
### 
Students protesting military
research ended a nine-day sit-in at
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) Friday
morning but indicated they would
resume it if they did not get
satisfaction in a week.
The end came at a mass
meeting of about 600 outside the
building as tensions were
mounting amidst fears that federal
forces would seek to end the
demonstration.
Meanwhile in a meeting of the
full Academic Council Friday
morning the Stanford faculty gave
President Kenneth S. Pitzer a
standing ovation for his "restraint
and firmness" in dealing with the
sit-in.
The sit-in ended about 45
minutes before the special faculty
meeting called by the President.
More than 700 of the University's
1000 professors attended.
Issues Statement
Later in the afternoon Pitzer
issued a statement saying in part
that all of the holdings of
Stanford Judicial Council
"published in The Stanford Daily
of April 18, 1969 are now in

effect as temporary regulations.
He added that "the Applied
Electronics Building is closed until
12 noon April 25 . . ."
In the early morning meeting
outside AEL, Doron Weinberg
explained what had happened the
night before.
He said that he and Yale
Braunstein were assured by Pitzer
that everyone except security and
maintenance personnel would be
kept out of the building.
Questions Raised
Various questions were asked
about researchers entering, as well
as such considerations as amnesty.
But no one seemed sure of the
answers to any of the questions.
They affirmed continued effort
will be made to inform the
Stanford community of their
demands that war-related research
on both the Stanford campus and
at Stanford Research Institute be
ended.
They will have a mass meeting
April 25, to "assess progress of
our demands and decide on any
tactical moves we deem necessary
which may include the
re-occupation of a university
building."
Federal Troops
In discussing the motion many
speakers talked of "not being
prepared to stand up against
police or federal troops."
The University did not call in
outside forces, but had warned
that it might not be able to
prevent federal troops from
entering the campus because of
the classified material which is in
the AEL.
Before leaving the lab, the
demonstrators asked that the
trustees consider these issues by
April 30.

Leave Building
They then voted almost
unanimously to "temporarily
suspend" their occupation. Most
then went to Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, where the Academic
Council was convening. Several
demonstrators with placards were
denied permission to walk
through it.
The sit-in cost an estimated
$5,000 a day in salaries to AE'j
employees. Property damage has
not yet been assessed.
The last demonstrators to leave
AEL were the clean-up crew,
which swept the floors and
scrubbed walls.
As the demonstrators left the
building, a number of AEL staff
members entered the building and
were seen removing files, boxes of
literature, and some equipment.
A number of student
lemonstrators called attention to
,he staff member's actions,
apparently violating Dr. Pitzer's
closing of the building, and asked
security guards to stop the
removal of research materials.
According to witnesses, the guards
took no action. Some
demonstrators say they have
photographs of AEL staff
members removing materials.
SJC Findings
In hearings Wednesday and
Thursday, the Stanford Judicial
Council unanimously found the
nine-day sit-in violated campus
disruption policy, and involved
"special circumstances" which
warranted the use of emergency
powers granted the President
under the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
A 5-2 Council majority
suggested the President "close"
