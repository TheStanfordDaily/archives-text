# Slim Student Majority Backs Possible Sit-In
## 
### 
Stanford students
overwhelmingly think the sit-in at
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory "has helped focus the
attention of the University upon
the nature of research conducted
at Stanford," according to a poll
taken of all students present at
yesterday's Frost amphitheater

meeting. More than 3000 students
cast ballots.
A slim majority of students
also indicated they would
participate "in a sit-in or similar
means of protest" if Stanford
Trustees do not "postively
respond to the desire of the
Stanford community regarding
research at Stanford and SRI and
in resolving the future relationship
between Stanford and SRI by
May 14."
The exact vote on the question
of the sit-in helping focus
attention was 3073 saying it did
and 203 that it didn't. 1633
students said they would sit in if
the Trustees don't act by May 14
while 1468 said they wouldn't.
Ballots were given all students
who carried valid student body
cards and each card was marked.
There were seven questions in
all on the ASSU supervised poll.
One, urging an end to the sit-in,
was disregarded in as much as the
sit-in was already over when the
meeting began.
In other votes, students by a
margin of 2207 to 970, supported
a cancellation of classes Tuesday
to allow a full day of speeches,
rallies and seminars on research in
universities. At press time, no

word had been received as to
whether classes, in fact, will be
called off.
By a margin of 2630 to 572,
students urged the Trustees to
make their decision regarding SRI
no later than their May 13
meeting.
A four part question on the
types of research proper at both
Stanford and SRI showed
students strongly against
biochemical warfare,
counter-insurgency, war-related
and classified research. The
margin on biochemical warfare
research was 2732 to 475. On
counter-insurgency it was 2395 to
772 while of war related research
it was 2414 to 684.
The closest vote was on the
question of classified research in
general. Here the vote was more
than 2 to 1 with the exact tally
showing 2120 against classified
research and 1045 in favor of it.
The other question on the
ballot was whether students
polled would participate in "an
Education Center in the Old
Union Courtyard as a base from
which to inform the University
community on the nature of
research being conducted at
Stanford and SRI."
