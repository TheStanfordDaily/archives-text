## Wipe Slate Clean 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
The following statement
should have been read at the
recent special meeting of the
Academic Council; however, I did
now know of that meeting in time
to complete its preparation.
During the past week we have
all been besieged by
administration and faculty
declarations that express
commitment essentially to the
same principles and ideals voiced
by the students who occupied
AEL. These declarations
invariably continued to their main
point, that the vehicle chosen by
the students for expressing their
moral concern is intolerable on
campus.
I should like to point out that I
have been on campus almost ten
years, and the only occasion I can
recall on which this issue was
raised officially by an
administrative or faculty source is
the event of three years ago, when
the Academic Council acted to
form the Committee on Research
Policy.
The comparisons just made by
the students in AEL, of the titles
of classified projects with the
Committee's description of the
same projects, show only too
clearly the manner in which that
committee has functioned. I
should emphasize that the
students' disclosures are based on
unclassified information they
found in AEL. Whatever may be
buried in locked files is open to
conjecture by all of us.
There was one other occasion
when I raised the issue at an
informal faculty meeting. At that
time I was assured, precisely by
the author of one of the current
declarations, that there was no
substance in my accusations and
that I was raising a bogeyman for

which I had no evidence. He was
quite right that I had no evidence
at the time. I had to wait for the
students in AEL to produce it.
In any event it is apparent that
the issues raised by the students
have found a response throughout
the University. I should like to
express my personal hope that the
faculty will not now content itself
with vindictive punishment of the
acts, out of context with the
social reality that led to them.
The students have perhaps
made their point too dramatically,
but they are basically in the right.
I suggest we concede the point
and concede we were wrong in the
past. The crime of killing, to
which our complacency and
inaction have made us all
accomplice, is no less a crime than
that of interfering with legalized
preparations for killing.
It is time to wipe the slate
clean and to start new, armed
with a social consciousness for
which we must thank our student
activists.

Dean Watkins, Trustee
Please continue to slam the
door in the faces of those who
would destroy our academic
system. I hope that you can carry
this principal further and slam the
doors of Stanford on all those
who preach dictatorship in the
name of freedom and who use
force, whether so called
"non-violent" or violent (which
seems inevitably to follow) as a
means of persuasion to their ends.
