# 'Maintain Windows To The World'

### Wolfgang Panofsky 
(Th'e following consists of Dr.
Panofsky's remarks to the student
body meeting yesterday. He is
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator- Ed.)
Denis Hayes has asked ne to
speak a few words about research
at the University. Stanford is an
educational institution, yet
research and education are
inseparable. One generates new
knowledge and the other
transmits it. If we separate the
two both suffer.
Most research at this University
is basic research, that is the only
thing which motivates the
researcher is a desire to develop
new knowledge to test theories
and speculation or to understand
better the past, the future, the
arts or nature.
Much research is applied and
what you are hearing so much
about now and about which there
is most controversy is applied
research, that is, research which is
dedicated to solving specified
problems.
SLAC is the largest example at
Stanford of a research activity
initiated by Stanford faculty
members and supported by the
United States Government. Work
at SLAC is in elementary
particle physics which deals with
trying to understand what nature
is like at the very smallest scale.
The work is open—everything
we do is freely published and
there are no secrets. We have
many foreign visitors from both
sides of the Iron Curtain. I believe
we have demonstrated that
research can be both big and also
free.
Professors' Initiative
How is research done at
StanfordTThe first thing I wish to
point out is that the initiative for
wishing to do a given piece of
research work should come from
the professor and his students.

It should not come from the
sponsors who pay for it if special
money is required.
Therefore the system of the
University in general and in
relation to research support in
particular depends on mutual
confidence much more than it
does on formal arrangements.
Once this confidence is broken we
have troubles and ultimately only
better communication and
understanding on the part of all
the parties can make the system
work.
Development of Research
Let me tell you some history:
After World War II began many
University people went into war
research; the country was fighting
Hitler and few people—students,
faculty or trustees—raised any
moral issues. After the war there
was a tremendous influx of
students back to the campuses
and the professors returned to
their academic work.
Large resources were required
and the government started to
support research, mainly in the
natural sciences. Before the war
the universities had supported
both research and education as is
their mission, but the scale was
much smaller. After the war, since
the government was willing to
support research, the universities
concentrated whatever money
they had on expanding and
improving education.
As a result, a pattern evolved
by which the government pays for
most of the research at the
universities while private or state
funds support education. This is
the case at all large universities in
the United States. Stanford is no
more or less a government
dependent. university than any
major institution in this country
you care to name.
Support From HEW
The support of research by the

government comes through many
agencies—only a small part comes
from the National Science
Foundation, which is specifically
charged by law to support
research. By far the largest part
comes from agencies which have
applied missions and which
support basic research only
incidentally. The largest
supported of research in
universities is the Department of
Health, Education and Welfare
which supports most of the work
in life sciences.
When any activity is initiated
by an independent group of
people, but is supported by
outside donors (be they public or
private), there is an immediate
problem of individual freedom on
the one hand, and collective
responsibility on the other. Shall
we let each researcher do what he
wants, independent of whether it
fits the larger purposes of the
University, or conversely, shall we
have a collective means of
decision making which "tells
everyone what to do?
Any thoughtful person will
agree that neither extreme will
work. We must have some
mechanism of constraint but this
constraint shall be no larger than
absolutely required; otherwise the
spread of individual initiative and
achievement will be stifled. It is
the essence of freedom that if we
wish to preserve individual
initiative then some things will be
going on which some of us may
not like, yet constraining it too
much will make all of us the losers
in the long run.
Part of the current debate is
about classified research and
war-related research. What is this'
As you well know some of the
research work on this campus is
carried out using information
from the military which is
considered secret and a part of

that has specific objectives which
are to assist the military. Each of
these proposals had been
approved and reviewed by a
faculty committee under rules
several years old. Many of us
believe that these rules should be
changed.
What I Believe
The question is then, what do I
believe? Speaking for myself I feel
the following:
1. I believe the University has
the duty to establish policies that
exercise some control as to what
research can or cannot be done
under its own auspices. It should
not establish rules as to what
individual members of the
University do in activities not
connected with the University.
2. I feel the University in the
future should not sponsor
research whose output is
classified, that is where the
product of the research would be
papers or gadgets which are not
open for everyone to read or to
see and where not any interested
student can participate in the
work.
3. Those members of the
University community who
personally feel that to guide their
work intelligently they should
have access to classified
information should have the
privilege to secure such
information.
Why Access
You may wonder why I made
the last remark—namely why I
said that individual members of
the community should have the
right to obtain access to classified
government information.
Let me tell you a story: Some
of you may have heard that I had
some recent involvement in
Washington about some testimony
concerning the anti-ballistic
missile system. Senator Fulbright,
one of the foes of the ABM, in

Congress was criticizing the
Defense Department for being lax
in getting enough outside advice
to guide its decisions.
Fulbright was criticizing that
all testimony the Defense
Department was presenting to him
either came from the Defense
Department itself or its defense
contractors. I was asked to testify
before his committee and
contradicted many of the
technical facts which had been
presented. Later I had the
privilege of having lunch with
Senator Fulbright and he
continued to deplore the
parochialism of the Defense
Department and he also deplored
the involvement of the Defense
Department in the universities.
The question is then "where
should the outside advice come
from?" and here we have a
dilemma—on the one hand we
deplore that the Defense
Department is isolating itself from
outside sources of information
while at the same time we decry
that people in the universities are
too involved in Defense
Department secrets.
I therefore feel that those
members of the university
community who individually wish
to remain independent
constructive critics of the
"establishment" must maintain
contact with the establishment
and learn what its problems are. I
feel that those research workers
who work on fully open research
still may wish to have knowledge
of what goes on in their field in
the outside world.
A university, to do its basic
work in advancing knowledge and
eeducation, must maintain its
windows open to see the world
but should exercise collective
moral restraint as to what kind of
work it advances.
