# Movement Plans Tours Of Potential Sit-In Sites
## 
### BARBARA HYLAND 
A guided tour of the Hanover
Building in the Industrial Park today at
noon marks the start of round two for
the April 3 Movement. It will follow a
noon rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Today there will also be intense
efforts to convert classes taught by
members of the Academic Senate into
discussions about SRI and research done
there and on campus.
At last night's meeting in the
courtyard of the Old Union, the present
headquarters of the Movement since its
withdrawal Friday from the Applied
Electronics Lab, 300 people voted to
initiate a series of guided tours of key
buildings in the area.
Today the target for a tour is the
Hanover Building because it has been
involved in counterinsurgency research.
Tuesday the Stanford Business School
will be visited.
Other Tours
Tentative tours of the Hoover
Institute, the Aero-Astro Space Sciences
Building, and the Applied Electronics
Building were also mentioned.
The tours will take place during
lunch hour this week. The buildings
were chosen because of their
importance from a political point of
view and also for their potential sit-in
facilities. "Declassified," the daily
newspaper of the Movement, will run
articles on the building of the day.
Besides being an implicit threat and
keeping the pressure on the trustees, the
tours are meant to be valuable in
educating the community.
At the meeting Hoover Tower was
cited as being a center of cold war
"propaganda." One speaker believed its
function had been "to create a Red
scare" thus bolstering the Government's
arguments when it wanted something
like the ABM.
Humor Approach
Students sympathetic to the
demands of the April 3 Movement are
expected to. participate in the tours.
One girl noted that the concept would
appeal to people's senses of humor. "I
can't imagine anything funnier than 300
radicals with cameras and brown bag
lunches being locked out of Hoo Tow,"
she said.
A major portion of the meeting was
devoted to the question of influencing
the Academic Senate before its meeting
Tuesday to discuss SRI and Stanford.
One member of the April 3 Movement
who met informally with several
members of the Academic Senate on
.Saturday said that some were
"profoundly uniformed about the
question of SRI and the SRI Study
Committee."
Sheets were distributed with the
names of all the members of the
Academic Senate, their office hours.

and their class hours. Those professors
"not so willing to engage in rational
dialogue" were marked by an "x."
Class Interruptions
Students were urged to interrupt
classes and focus attention on the
relevant issues. They were warned that
some professors might walk out of their
classes at any attempted interruptions.
During the meeting reports on the
racial disturbance in East Menlo Park
were periodically given. It was proposed
that to counter the police's
counterinsurgency, the Movement act in
some manner that would be legal but
would simultaneously divert some of
the police pressure off the black
community.
It was proposed that the meeting
break up and reconvene at the SRI
parking lot. This move would advance
solidarity between the Movement and
those being oppressed, one speaker
explained. The proposal was tabled until
more substantial information on the
disturbance was known.
Later reports proved that the
disturbance was not of the magnitude
that was originally believed.
Watson Invited
At the meeting it was decided • to
invite John Watson, a leader of the
League of Revolutionary Black Workers,
to speak. He will talk tonight at 8 about
the working class and black liberation in
the Old Union Courtyard. The League

has organized black workers in many of
Detroit's auto plants around radical
demands.
Following this speech a community
meeting is planned in the courtyard.
The April 3 Movement has also
decided to enter Spring Sing with some
of its original songs like "Rambo Black
Crow."
Support has been surging and at the
meeting a telegram of encouragement
coming from the National Union of
French Students was read.

The Cory-Schultz ticket will be campaigning in Wilbur, Stern and the
fraternities today.

A guided tour of the Hanover
Building in the Industrial Park today at
noon marks the start of round two for
the April 3 Movement. It will follow a
noon rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Today there will also be intense
efforts to convert classes taught by
members of the Academic Senate into
discussions about SRI and research done
there and on campus.
At last night's meeting in the
courtyard of the Old Union, the present
headquarters of the Movement since its
withdrawal Friday from the Applied
Electronics Lab, 300 people voted to
initiate a series of guided tours of key
buildings in the area.
Today the target for a tour is the
Hanover Building because it has been
involved in counterinsurgency research.
Tuesday the Stanford Business School
will be visited.
Other Tours
Tentative tours of the Hoover
Institute, the Aero-Astro Space Sciences
Building, and the Applied Electronics
Building were also mentioned.
The tours will take place during
lunch hour this week. The buildings
were chosen because of their
importance from a political point of
view and also for their potential sit-in
facilities. "Declassified," the daily
newspaper of the Movement, will run
articles on the building of the day.
Besides being an implicit threat and
keeping the pressure on the trustees, the
tours are meant to be valuable in
educating the community.
At the meeting Hoover Tower was
cited as being a center of cold war
"propaganda." One speaker believed its
function had been "to create a Red
scare" thus bolstering the Government's
arguments when it wanted something
like the ABM.
Humor Approach
Students sympathetic to the
demands of the April 3 Movement are
expected to. participate in the tours.
One girl noted that the concept would
appeal to people's senses of humor. "I
can't imagine anything funnier than 300
radicals with cameras and brown bag
lunches being locked out of Hoo Tow,"
she said.
A major portion of the meeting was
devoted to the question of influencing
the Academic Senate before its meeting
Tuesday to discuss SRI and Stanford.
One member of the April 3 Movement
who met informally with several
members of the Academic Senate on
.Saturday said that some were
"profoundly uniformed about the
question of SRI and the SRI Study
Committee."
Sheets were distributed with the
names of all the members of the
Academic Senate, their office hours.

and their class hours. Those professors
"not so willing to engage in rational
dialogue" were marked by an "x."
Class Interruptions
Students were urged to interrupt
classes and focus attention on the
relevant issues. They were warned that
some professors might walk out of their
classes at any attempted interruptions.
During the meeting reports on the
racial disturbance in East Menlo Park
were periodically given. It was proposed
that to counter the police's
counterinsurgency, the Movement act in
some manner that would be legal but
would simultaneously divert some of
the police pressure off the black
community.
It was proposed that the meeting
break up and reconvene at the SRI
parking lot. This move would advance
solidarity between the Movement and
those being oppressed, one speaker
explained. The proposal was tabled until
more substantial information on the
disturbance was known.
Later reports proved that the
disturbance was not of the magnitude
that was originally believed.
Watson Invited
At the meeting it was decided • to
invite John Watson, a leader of the
League of Revolutionary Black Workers,
to speak. He will talk tonight at 8 about
the working class and black liberation in
the Old Union Courtyard. The League

has organized black workers in many of
Detroit's auto plants around radical
demands.
Following this speech a community
meeting is planned in the courtyard.
The April 3 Movement has also
decided to enter Spring Sing with some
of its original songs like "Rambo Black
Crow."
Support has been surging and at the
meeting a telegram of encouragement
coming from the National Union of
French Students was read.

The Cory-Schultz ticket will be campaigning in Wilbur, Stern and the

A guided tour of the Hanover
Building in the Industrial Park today at
noon marks the start of round two for
the April 3 Movement. It will follow a
noon rally in the Old Union courtyard.
Today there will also be intense
efforts to convert classes taught by
members of the Academic Senate into
discussions about SRI and research done
there and on campus.
At last night's meeting in the
courtyard of the Old Union, the present
headquarters of the Movement since its
withdrawal Friday from the Applied
Electronics Lab, 300 people voted to
initiate a series of guided tours of key
buildings in the area.
Today the target for a tour is the
Hanover Building because it has been
involved in counterinsurgency research.
Tuesday the Stanford Business School
will be visited.
Other Tours
Tentative tours of the Hoover
Institute, the Aero-Astro Space Sciences
Building, and the Applied Electronics
Building were also mentioned.
The tours will take place during
lunch hour this week. The buildings
were chosen because of their
importance from a political point of
view and also for their potential sit-in
facilities. "Declassified," the daily
newspaper of the Movement, will run
articles on the building of the day.
Besides being an implicit threat and
keeping the pressure on the trustees, the
tours are meant to be valuable in
educating the community.
At the meeting Hoover Tower was
cited as being a center of cold war
"propaganda." One speaker believed its
function had been "to create a Red
scare" thus bolstering the Government's
arguments when it wanted something
like the ABM.
Humor Approach
Students sympathetic to the
demands of the April 3 Movement are
expected to. participate in the tours.
One girl noted that the concept would
appeal to people's senses of humor. "I
can't imagine anything funnier than 300
radicals with cameras and brown bag
lunches being locked out of Hoo Tow,"
she said.
A major portion of the meeting was
devoted to the question of influencing
the Academic Senate before its meeting
Tuesday to discuss SRI and Stanford.
One member of the April 3 Movement
who met informally with several
members of the Academic Senate on
.Saturday said that some were
"profoundly uniformed about the
question of SRI and the SRI Study
Committee."
Sheets were distributed with the
names of all the members of the
Academic Senate, their office hours.

and their class hours. Those professors
"not so willing to engage in rational
dialogue" were marked by an "x."
Class Interruptions
Students were urged to interrupt
classes and focus attention on the
relevant issues. They were warned that
some professors might walk out of their
classes at any attempted interruptions.
During the meeting reports on the
racial disturbance in East Menlo Park
were periodically given. It was proposed
that to counter the police's
counterinsurgency, the Movement act in
some manner that would be legal but
would simultaneously divert some of
the police pressure off the black
community.
It was proposed that the meeting
break up and reconvene at the SRI
parking lot. This move would advance
solidarity between the Movement and
those being oppressed, one speaker
explained. The proposal was tabled until
more substantial information on the
disturbance was known.
Later reports proved that the
disturbance was not of the magnitude
that was originally believed.
