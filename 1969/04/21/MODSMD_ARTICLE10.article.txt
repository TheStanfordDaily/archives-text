# 'Ugly, Sometimes Fierce'
## Beyers' Counterinsurgency 
### Michael Sweeney 
Last Friday, the student body
gathered in Frost Ampitheater to
discuss and vote on the pressing
issues of University research.
When the votes were counted at
10 p.m. that night, it was clear
that the students had endorsed
the goals and tactics of the April
3rd Movement by an
overwhelming margin.
The results of that balloting
had immense significance for this
University, if not for the nation.
Research to kill was condemned
here and at SRI. And a clear
majority of the students who
voted —1 633—said they would
sit-in if the Trustees did not
acceed to the wishes of the
community in the SRI
con troversy.
Given the urgent importance of
these votes, it seems only sensible
that the results should have been
communicated to the University
community and the mass media
with no delay.
But that didn't happen. Except
for a special edition of the Daily
with skimpy distribution, no
mention of the voting appeared in
any newspaper or radio news until
18 hours after the results were
announced at the ASSU offices.
There is a fascinating story
behind that 18-hour supression of
the vote results. It should raise
some serious doubts about free
press and publication at Stanford.
It is a case study in domestic
cou nterinsurgency.
Worked Furiously
Throughout the sit-in, the
Stanford News Service worked
furiously to put out a large
number of news releases. Robert
Beyers and his staff of 20 worked
long hours of overtime in writing,
printing and mailing releases and
answering queries. On some days

the staff worked all night until 5
a.m., and Beyers himself worked
non-stop. In short, Beyers tried to
provide the news media with
everything he judged worth
knowing about the sit-in.
Beyerg' office took on an
additional role during the sit-in:
an internal information source for
faculty and administration.
Special delivery letters to all
faculty went out with statements,
memos and news releases. Faculty
were deluged with Beyers'
summaries of sit-in news.
It seemed that Beyers and his
associates had assumed
responsibility not only for
external press coverage, but also
for telling the faculty everything
they needed to know.
Policy Change?
But on Friday night, while the
stunning votes were being
tabulated by the ASSU, Beyers
seems to have made a sudden
change in policy. On that night,
he closed his office early and sent
his staff home. Beyers himself was
at The Daily office around 9 p.m.,
but failed to inquire what time
the vote counting would be
completed (it was finished at 10).
Instead, he went home. Beyers has
told us that he decided "not to
cover it that night. . .1 decided
that I would catch it the next day
in the morning." Doubtlessly,
Beyers' journalistic zeal was
dampened because he and his staff
were "just physically exhausted."
Beyers went home. He admits
that he knew that his inaction
made it probable that none of the
Saturday morning papers, except
for the Daily's limited edition,
would carry the voting results.
And none of them did.
Herzenberg Phones
Come Saturday, it seems that

Beyers let the morning pass
without finding out how the
students voted. But at noon, he
received a phone call from Dr.
Leonard Herzenberg, associate
professor of genetics. Why, asked
Dr. Herzenberg, had the faculty
received thick packets of news
releases that morning but no word
of the student votes? Beyers said
he had put out no release on the
balloting and said he had no
immediate plans to do so.
Dr. Herzenberg pointed out
that Beyers had previously gone
to the trouble of sending special
delibery letters to all faculty with
news of much less importance. Dr.
Herzenberg added that faculty
were making up their minds about
crucial issues over the weekend,
and should have a chance to learn
the voting results. Beyers
suggested that a note in
Wednesday's Campus Report
would be enough. Dr. Herzenberg
questioned Beyers' fairness. The
conversation ended.
At 1 o'clock, Beyers was on
the phone to the Daily to get the
vote results from Mr. Tom
Dawson. But Beyers took no
hasty action. Instead he spent the
balance of the afternoon
"checking out," as he put it, the
story. For example:
Calls Hay es
Beyers called up Denis Hayes
and asked him what he knew
about rumors that a mob of
radicals had roughed up some
student police outside Frost
Ampitheater and stolen a stack of
blank ballots. Hayes was skeptical.
"About an hour later," says
Hayes, "he called back and
indicated he had talked to a
couple of people who had seen
some ballots taken." Whereupon,
according to Beyers, "Hayes told
me he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater." Beyers wrote down
these newly found facts for future
use.
Menawhile, the afternoon had
slipped by and the Palo Alto
Times had appeared, without any
report of the voting. By late
afternoon, students at the April
3rd Movement began to suspect
that the Stanford News Service
had somehow failed us. We called
up The Daily and persuaded
Executive Editor Marshall

Schwartz to telephone the results
to the key news media.
'Time Not Urgent'
First Schwartz called Beyers
and asked him when he was going
to put out a release. Beyers said
he was thinking of Sunday night.
As Beyers commented later, "To
me, the time factor did not seem
that urgent." Whereupon
Schwartz told Beyers that he was
going to give the story to the
newspapers immediately.
Thus, at 5:30 p.m. Saturday,
the first news leaked to the
outside press.
Beyers made a quick
reassessment of his news policy.
He called the Associated Press just
minutes ahead of Schwartz.
Beyers, providently, had prepared
a story about the voting results,
with a few carefully composed
paragraphs to enhance objectivity:
"When a group of about 50
students from the sit-in came
toward the anipitheater, they
took some ballots away from a
student checking identification
there, according to two student
witnesses. Less than 100 ballots
were believed involved.
"Hayes, who had suggested
that the ballots be given only to
students showing identification,
said he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater."
The Associated Press did not
share Beyer's judgment that these
two paragraphs were newsworthy.
They did not appear in the AP
dispatch.
Beyers' release to AP had
another quirk which we found
interesting. He told AP, "the
results were disclosed Saturday."
Actually they were announced
Friday. When we questioned
Beyers on this point, he replied,
"If I had said that the results were
disclosed Friday, everybody
would have said the hell with it,
since it was old news."
We suggested to Beyers that his
dedication to the University, as he
conceives it, may be messing up
his work. He replied:
"I consider my position that of
a general assignment reporter in
looking at activities that go onin
the University. I think that my
job is best performed by trying to
act on that belief, and view things
in that perspective, rather than in
the conventional public relations
perspective that you are just
backing one side or the other."

for a special edition of the Daily
with skimpy distribution, no
mention of the voting appeared in
any newspaper or radio news until
18 hours after the results were
announced at the ASSU offices.
There is a fascinating story
behind that 18-hour supression of
the vote results. It should raise
some serious doubts about free
press and publication at Stanford.
It is a case study in domestic
cou nterinsurgency.
Worked Furiously
Throughout the sit-in, the
Stanford News Service worked
furiously to put out a large
number of news releases. Robert
Beyers and his staff of 20 worked
long hours of overtime in writing,
printing and mailing releases and
answering queries. On some days

the staff worked all night until 5
a.m., and Beyers himself worked
non-stop. In short, Beyers tried to
provide the news media with
everything he judged worth
knowing about the sit-in.
Beyerg' office took on an
additional role during the sit-in:
an internal information source for
faculty and administration.
Special delivery letters to all
faculty went out with statements,
memos and news releases. Faculty
were deluged with Beyers'
summaries of sit-in news.
It seemed that Beyers and his
associates had assumed
responsibility not only for
external press coverage, but also
for telling the faculty everything
they needed to know.
Policy Change?
But on Friday night, while the
stunning votes were being
tabulated by the ASSU, Beyers
seems to have made a sudden
change in policy. On that night,
he closed his office early and sent
his staff home. Beyers himself was
at The Daily office around 9 p.m.,
but failed to inquire what time
the vote counting would be
completed (it was finished at 10).
Instead, he went home. Beyers has
told us that he decided "not to
cover it that night. . .1 decided
that I would catch it the next day
in the morning." Doubtlessly,
Beyers' journalistic zeal was
dampened because he and his staff
were "just physically exhausted."
Beyers went home. He admits
that he knew that his inaction
made it probable that none of the
Saturday morning papers, except
for the Daily's limited edition,
would carry the voting results.
And none of them did.
Herzenberg Phones
Come Saturday, it seems that

Beyers let the morning pass
without finding out how the
students voted. But at noon, he
received a phone call from Dr.
Leonard Herzenberg, associate
professor of genetics. Why, asked
Dr. Herzenberg, had the faculty
received thick packets of news
releases that morning but no word
of the student votes? Beyers said
he had put out no release on the
balloting and said he had no
immediate plans to do so.
Dr. Herzenberg pointed out
that Beyers had previously gone
to the trouble of sending special
delibery letters to all faculty with
news of much less importance. Dr.
Herzenberg added that faculty
were making up their minds about
crucial issues over the weekend,
and should have a chance to learn
the voting results. Beyers
suggested that a note in
Wednesday's Campus Report
would be enough. Dr. Herzenberg
questioned Beyers' fairness. The
conversation ended.
At 1 o'clock, Beyers was on
the phone to the Daily to get the
vote results from Mr. Tom
Dawson. But Beyers took no
hasty action. Instead he spent the
balance of the afternoon
"checking out," as he put it, the
story. For example:
Calls Hay es
Beyers called up Denis Hayes
and asked him what he knew
about rumors that a mob of
radicals had roughed up some
student police outside Frost
Ampitheater and stolen a stack of
blank ballots. Hayes was skeptical.
"About an hour later," says
Hayes, "he called back and
indicated he had talked to a
couple of people who had seen
some ballots taken." Whereupon,
according to Beyers, "Hayes told
me he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater." Beyers wrote down
these newly found facts for future
use.
Menawhile, the afternoon had
slipped by and the Palo Alto
Times had appeared, without any
report of the voting. By late
afternoon, students at the April
3rd Movement began to suspect
that the Stanford News Service
had somehow failed us. We called
up The Daily and persuaded
Executive Editor Marshall

Schwartz to telephone the results
to the key news media.
'Time Not Urgent'
First Schwartz called Beyers
and asked him when he was going
to put out a release. Beyers said
he was thinking of Sunday night.
As Beyers commented later, "To
me, the time factor did not seem
that urgent." Whereupon
Schwartz told Beyers that he was
going to give the story to the
newspapers immediately.
Thus, at 5:30 p.m. Saturday,
the first news leaked to the
outside press.
Beyers made a quick
reassessment of his news policy.
He called the Associated Press just
minutes ahead of Schwartz.
Beyers, providently, had prepared
a story about the voting results,
with a few carefully composed
paragraphs to enhance objectivity:
"When a group of about 50
students from the sit-in came
toward the anipitheater, they
took some ballots away from a
student checking identification
there, according to two student
witnesses. Less than 100 ballots
were believed involved.
"Hayes, who had suggested
that the ballots be given only to
students showing identification,
said he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater."
The Associated Press did not
share Beyer's judgment that these
two paragraphs were newsworthy.
They did not appear in the AP
dispatch.
Beyers' release to AP had
another quirk which we found
interesting. He told AP, "the
results were disclosed Saturday."
Actually they were announced
Friday. When we questioned
Beyers on this point, he replied,
"If I had said that the results were
disclosed Friday, everybody
would have said the hell with it,
since it was old news."
We suggested to Beyers that his
dedication to the University, as he
conceives it, may be messing up
his work. He replied:
"I consider my position that of
a general assignment reporter in
looking at activities that go onin
the University. I think that my
job is best performed by trying to
act on that belief, and view things
in that perspective, rather than in
the conventional public relations
perspective that you are just
backing one side or the other."

member of the April 3rd
movement, and a regular DAILY
columnist-Ed.)
Last Friday, the student body
gathered in Frost Ampitheater to
discuss and vote on the pressing
issues of University research.
When the votes were counted at
10 p.m. that night, it was clear
that the students had endorsed
the goals and tactics of the April
3rd Movement by an
overwhelming margin.
The results of that balloting
had immense significance for this
University, if not for the nation.
Research to kill was condemned
here and at SRI. And a clear
majority of the students who
voted —1 633—said they would
sit-in if the Trustees did not
acceed to the wishes of the
community in the SRI
con troversy.
Given the urgent importance of
these votes, it seems only sensible
that the results should have been
communicated to the University
community and the mass media
with no delay.
But that didn't happen. Except
for a special edition of the Daily
with skimpy distribution, no
mention of the voting appeared in

Beyerg' office took on an
additional role during the sit-in:
an internal information source for
faculty and administration.
Special delivery letters to all
faculty went out with statements,
memos and news releases. Faculty
were deluged with Beyers'
summaries of sit-in news.
It seemed that Beyers and his
associates had assumed
responsibility not only for
external press coverage, but also
for telling the faculty everything
they needed to know.
Policy Change?
But on Friday night, while the
stunning votes were being
tabulated by the ASSU, Beyers
seems to have made a sudden
change in policy. On that night,
he closed his office early and sent
his staff home. Beyers himself was
at The Daily office around 9 p.m.,
but failed to inquire what time
the vote counting would be
completed (it was finished at 10).
Instead, he went home. Beyers has
told us that he decided "not to
cover it that night. . .1 decided
that I would catch it the next day
in the morning." Doubtlessly,
Beyers' journalistic zeal was
dampened because he and his staff
were "just physically exhausted."
Beyers went home. He admits
that he knew that his inaction
made it probable that none of the
Saturday morning papers, except
for the Daily's limited edition,
would carry the voting results.
And none of them did.
Herzenberg Phones
Come Saturday, it seems that

Beyers let the morning pass
without finding out how the
students voted. But at noon, he
received a phone call from Dr.
Leonard Herzenberg, associate
professor of genetics. Why, asked
Dr. Herzenberg, had the faculty
received thick packets of news
releases that morning but no word
of the student votes? Beyers said
he had put out no release on the
balloting and said he had no
immediate plans to do so.
Dr. Herzenberg pointed out
that Beyers had previously gone
to the trouble of sending special
delibery letters to all faculty with
news of much less importance. Dr.
Herzenberg added that faculty
were making up their minds about
crucial issues over the weekend,
and should have a chance to learn
the voting results. Beyers
suggested that a note in
Wednesday's Campus Report
would be enough. Dr. Herzenberg
questioned Beyers' fairness. The
conversation ended.
At 1 o'clock, Beyers was on
the phone to the Daily to get the
vote results from Mr. Tom
Dawson. But Beyers took no
hasty action. Instead he spent the
balance of the afternoon
"checking out," as he put it, the
story. For example:
Calls Hay es
Beyers called up Denis Hayes
and asked him what he knew
about rumors that a mob of
radicals had roughed up some
student police outside Frost
Ampitheater and stolen a stack of
blank ballots. Hayes was skeptical.
"About an hour later," says
Hayes, "he called back and
indicated he had talked to a
couple of people who had seen
some ballots taken." Whereupon,
according to Beyers, "Hayes told
me he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater." Beyers wrote down
these newly found facts for future
use.
Menawhile, the afternoon had
slipped by and the Palo Alto
Times had appeared, without any
report of the voting. By late
afternoon, students at the April
3rd Movement began to suspect
that the Stanford News Service
had somehow failed us. We called
up The Daily and persuaded
Executive Editor Marshall

Schwartz to telephone the results
to the key news media.
'Time Not Urgent'
First Schwartz called Beyers
and asked him when he was going
to put out a release. Beyers said
he was thinking of Sunday night.
As Beyers commented later, "To
me, the time factor did not seem
that urgent." Whereupon
Schwartz told Beyers that he was
going to give the story to the
newspapers immediately.
Thus, at 5:30 p.m. Saturday,
the first news leaked to the
outside press.
Beyers made a quick
reassessment of his news policy.
He called the Associated Press just
minutes ahead of Schwartz.
Beyers, providently, had prepared
a story about the voting results,
with a few carefully composed
paragraphs to enhance objectivity:
"When a group of about 50
students from the sit-in came
toward the anipitheater, they
took some ballots away from a
student checking identification
there, according to two student
witnesses. Less than 100 ballots
were believed involved.
"Hayes, who had suggested
that the ballots be given only to
students showing identification,
said he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater."
The Associated Press did not
share Beyer's judgment that these
two paragraphs were newsworthy.
They did not appear in the AP
dispatch.
Beyers' release to AP had
another quirk which we found
interesting. He told AP, "the
results were disclosed Saturday."
Actually they were announced
Friday. When we questioned
Beyers on this point, he replied,
"If I had said that the results were
disclosed Friday, everybody
would have said the hell with it,
since it was old news."
We suggested to Beyers that his
dedication to the University, as he
conceives it, may be messing up
his work. He replied:
"I consider my position that of
a general assignment reporter in
looking at activities that go onin
the University. I think that my
job is best performed by trying to
act on that belief, and view things
in that perspective, rather than in
the conventional public relations
perspective that you are just
backing one side or the other."

Last Friday, the student body
gathered in Frost Ampitheater to
discuss and vote on the pressing
issues of University research.
When the votes were counted at
10 p.m. that night, it was clear
that the students had endorsed
the goals and tactics of the April
3rd Movement by an
overwhelming margin.
The results of that balloting
had immense significance for this
University, if not for the nation.
Research to kill was condemned
here and at SRI. And a clear
majority of the students who
voted —1 633—said they would
sit-in if the Trustees did not
acceed to the wishes of the
community in the SRI
con troversy.
Given the urgent importance of
these votes, it seems only sensible
that the results should have been
communicated to the University
community and the mass media
with no delay.
But that didn't happen. Except
for a special edition of the Daily
with skimpy distribution, no
mention of the voting appeared in
any newspaper or radio news until
18 hours after the results were
announced at the ASSU offices.
There is a fascinating story
behind that 18-hour supression of
the vote results. It should raise
some serious doubts about free
press and publication at Stanford.
It is a case study in domestic
cou nterinsurgency.
Worked Furiously
Throughout the sit-in, the
Stanford News Service worked
furiously to put out a large
number of news releases. Robert
Beyers and his staff of 20 worked
long hours of overtime in writing,
printing and mailing releases and
answering queries. On some days

the staff worked all night until 5
a.m., and Beyers himself worked
non-stop. In short, Beyers tried to
provide the news media with
everything he judged worth
knowing about the sit-in.

cover it that night. . .1 decided
that I would catch it the next day
in the morning." Doubtlessly,
Beyers' journalistic zeal was
dampened because he and his staff
were "just physically exhausted."
Beyers went home. He admits
that he knew that his inaction
made it probable that none of the
Saturday morning papers, except
for the Daily's limited edition,
would carry the voting results.
And none of them did.
Herzenberg Phones
Come Saturday, it seems that

Beyers let the morning pass
without finding out how the
students voted. But at noon, he
received a phone call from Dr.
Leonard Herzenberg, associate
professor of genetics. Why, asked
Dr. Herzenberg, had the faculty
received thick packets of news
releases that morning but no word
of the student votes? Beyers said
he had put out no release on the
balloting and said he had no
immediate plans to do so.
Dr. Herzenberg pointed out
that Beyers had previously gone
to the trouble of sending special
delibery letters to all faculty with
news of much less importance. Dr.
Herzenberg added that faculty
were making up their minds about
crucial issues over the weekend,
and should have a chance to learn
the voting results. Beyers
suggested that a note in
Wednesday's Campus Report
would be enough. Dr. Herzenberg
questioned Beyers' fairness. The
conversation ended.
At 1 o'clock, Beyers was on
the phone to the Daily to get the
vote results from Mr. Tom
Dawson. But Beyers took no
hasty action. Instead he spent the
balance of the afternoon
"checking out," as he put it, the
story. For example:
Calls Hay es
Beyers called up Denis Hayes
and asked him what he knew
about rumors that a mob of
radicals had roughed up some
student police outside Frost
Ampitheater and stolen a stack of
blank ballots. Hayes was skeptical.
"About an hour later," says
Hayes, "he called back and
indicated he had talked to a
couple of people who had seen
some ballots taken." Whereupon,
according to Beyers, "Hayes told
me he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater." Beyers wrote down
these newly found facts for future
use.
Menawhile, the afternoon had
slipped by and the Palo Alto
Times had appeared, without any
report of the voting. By late
afternoon, students at the April
3rd Movement began to suspect
that the Stanford News Service
had somehow failed us. We called
up The Daily and persuaded
Executive Editor Marshall

Schwartz to telephone the results
to the key news media.
'Time Not Urgent'
First Schwartz called Beyers
and asked him when he was going
to put out a release. Beyers said
he was thinking of Sunday night.
As Beyers commented later, "To
me, the time factor did not seem
that urgent." Whereupon
Schwartz told Beyers that he was
going to give the story to the
newspapers immediately.
Thus, at 5:30 p.m. Saturday,
the first news leaked to the
outside press.
Beyers made a quick
reassessment of his news policy.
He called the Associated Press just
minutes ahead of Schwartz.
Beyers, providently, had prepared
a story about the voting results,
with a few carefully composed
paragraphs to enhance objectivity:
"When a group of about 50
students from the sit-in came
toward the anipitheater, they
took some ballots away from a
student checking identification
there, according to two student
witnesses. Less than 100 ballots
were believed involved.
"Hayes, who had suggested
that the ballots be given only to
students showing identification,
said he was 'terribly depressed'
about the incident outside the
ampitheater."
The Associated Press did not
share Beyer's judgment that these
two paragraphs were newsworthy.
They did not appear in the AP
dispatch.
Beyers' release to AP had
another quirk which we found
interesting. He told AP, "the
results were disclosed Saturday."
Actually they were announced
Friday. When we questioned
Beyers on this point, he replied,
"If I had said that the results were
disclosed Friday, everybody
would have said the hell with it,
since it was old news."
We suggested to Beyers that his
dedication to the University, as he
conceives it, may be messing up
his work. He replied:
"I consider my position that of
a general assignment reporter in
looking at activities that go onin
the University. I think that my
job is best performed by trying to
act on that belief, and view things
in that perspective, rather than in
the conventional public relations
perspective that you are just
backing one side or the other."

Last Friday, the student body
gathered in Frost Ampitheater to
discuss and vote on the pressing
issues of University research.
When the votes were counted at
10 p.m. that night, it was clear
that the students had endorsed
the goals and tactics of the April
3rd Movement by an
overwhelming margin.
The results of that balloting
had immense significance for this
University, if not for the nation.
Research to kill was condemned
here and at SRI. And a clear
majority of the students who
voted —1 633—said they would
sit-in if the Trustees did not
acceed to the wishes of the
community in the SRI
con troversy.
Given the urgent importance of
these votes, it seems only sensible
that the results should have been
communicated to the University
community and the mass media
with no delay.
But that didn't happen. Except
for a special edition of the Daily
with skimpy distribution, no
mention of the voting appeared in
any newspaper or radio news until
18 hours after the results were
announced at the ASSU offices.
There is a fascinating story
behind that 18-hour supression of
the vote results. It should raise
some serious doubts about free
press and publication at Stanford.
It is a case study in domestic
cou nterinsurgency.
Worked Furiously
Throughout the sit-in, the
Stanford News Service worked
furiously to put out a large
number of news releases. Robert
Beyers and his staff of 20 worked
long hours of overtime in writing,
printing and mailing releases and
answering queries. On some days

the staff worked all night until 5
a.m., and Beyers himself worked
non-stop. In short, Beyers tried to
provide the news media with
everything he judged worth
knowing about the sit-in.
Beyerg' office took on an
additional role during the sit-in:
an internal information source for
faculty and administration.
Special delivery letters to all
faculty went out with statements,
memos and news releases. Faculty
were deluged with Beyers'
summaries of sit-in news.
It seemed that Beyers and his
associates had assumed
responsibility not only for
external press coverage, but also
for telling the faculty everything
they needed to know.
Policy Change?
But on Friday night, while the
stunning votes were being
tabulated by the ASSU, Beyers
seems to have made a sudden
change in policy. On that night,
he closed his office early and sent
his staff home. Beyers himself was
at The Daily office around 9 p.m.,
but failed to inquire what time
the vote counting would be
completed (it was finished at 10).
Instead, he went home. Beyers has
told us that he decided "not to
cover it that night. . .1 decided
that I would catch it the next day
in the morning." Doubtlessly,
Beyers' journalistic zeal was
dampened because he and his staff
were "just physically exhausted."

made it probable that none of the
