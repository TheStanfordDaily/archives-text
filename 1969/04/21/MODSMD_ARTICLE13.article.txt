# Weekly Flicks Promise Classic, Exciting Viewing
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Two landmarks of the German
cinema and two minor classics
from America are among this
week's films.
Fritz Lang's monumental
Metropolis will be shown at
Tresidder on Monday night as the
first of three German classics.
Made in 1926, Metropolis details
the horrors of a mechanized
Utopia and, while the film is
absurd in many of its details, it is
impressive for its visual design,
notably for the geometric layout
of masses of people.
Though Clive has left, his film
series will continue in Geology
3 20. From now on, however,
there will be just one film per
week, to be shown twice on
Tuesday nights. This week: the
superb screen adaptation of Lilian
Hellman's The Little Foxes.
Directed by William Wyler and
photographed by Gregg Toland

(Citizen Kane), the film offers
Bette Davis in her prime as
Regina. An example of
Hollywood craftsmanship at its
best.
Salt of the Earth will be shown
in Cubberley on Thursday at
4:15. This 1953 film is a realistic
look at the plight of
Mexican-American families- in our
Southwest, concentrating on a
miners' strike in 1951-52. The
writer, producer and directed
were blacklisted from Hollywood
for the "communist propoganda"
supposedly present in their
picture.
Silent Flick Masterpiece
This week's I-Center film, The
Last Laugh, represents one of the
peak achievements of the silent
cinema. Made in 1924, the film

used, for the first time, the
camera as an actor, conveying its
moods and emotional states
subjectively. The moving camera
is also used to great advantage
visually adding to the meaning of
a scene. So effective is Murnau's
camera and his actor, Emil
Jannings, that not one
explanatory title had to be used.
This rarely seen classic will be
shown in Physics Tank at 8:15 on
Thursday with a co-feature, The
Reality of Karl Appel.
Luis Bunuel's Subida al Cielo
(Mexican Bus Ride) was made in
1951, during the director's
"populist" period in Mexico. The
film is the unpredictable odyssey
of diverse people on a bus and
contains Bunuel's unusual knocks
at priests. Showing with it on

Friday night at Tresidder is the
incredible surrealistic short, lln
Chien Andalou, which Bunuel
made with Salvador Dali. A truly
amazing film which bears repeated
viewings; Freud is said to have
been fascinated by its symbols
and implications.
Alfred Hitchcock purposely
imposed upon himself the smallest
setting ever to be used in a film in
Lifeboat, to be shown Saturday at
Tresidder. Tallulah Bankhead,
William Bendix, Walter Slezak and
Hume Cronyn star in this picture,
which caused great critical
controversy in 1943, due not in
small part to the fact that a Nazi
is portrayed as the most capable
person on board the lifeboat.
Watch closely for Hitchcock's
highly amusing appearance :n this
one.
Marriage Italian Style is a truly
wonderful film, especially in its
original Italian version, but I have
doubts as to how it will survive a
showing at the Sunday flick.
At any rate, the film offers
Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia
Loren at their best.

were blacklisted from Hollywood
for the "communist propoganda"
supposedly present in their
picture.
Silent Flick Masterpiece
This week's I-Center film, The
Last Laugh, represents one of the
peak achievements of the silent
cinema. Made in 1924, the film

used, for the first time, the
camera as an actor, conveying its
moods and emotional states
subjectively. The moving camera
is also used to great advantage
visually adding to the meaning of
a scene. So effective is Murnau's
camera and his actor, Emil
Jannings, that not one
explanatory title had to be used.
This rarely seen classic will be
shown in Physics Tank at 8:15 on
Thursday with a co-feature, The
Reality of Karl Appel.
Luis Bunuel's Subida al Cielo
(Mexican Bus Ride) was made in
1951, during the director's
"populist" period in Mexico. The
film is the unpredictable odyssey
of diverse people on a bus and
contains Bunuel's unusual knocks
at priests. Showing with it on

Friday night at Tresidder is the
incredible surrealistic short, lln
Chien Andalou, which Bunuel
made with Salvador Dali. A truly
amazing film which bears repeated
viewings; Freud is said to have
been fascinated by its symbols
and implications.
Alfred Hitchcock purposely
imposed upon himself the smallest
setting ever to be used in a film in
Lifeboat, to be shown Saturday at
Tresidder. Tallulah Bankhead,
William Bendix, Walter Slezak and
Hume Cronyn star in this picture,
which caused great critical
controversy in 1943, due not in
small part to the fact that a Nazi
is portrayed as the most capable
person on board the lifeboat.
Watch closely for Hitchcock's
highly amusing appearance :n this
one.
Marriage Italian Style is a truly
wonderful film, especially in its
original Italian version, but I have
doubts as to how it will survive a
showing at the Sunday flick.
At any rate, the film offers
Marcello Mastroianni and Sophia
Loren at their best.
Two landmarks of the German
cinema and two minor classics
from America are among this
week's films.
Fritz Lang's monumental
Metropolis will be shown at
Tresidder on Monday night as the
first of three German classics.
Made in 1926, Metropolis details
the horrors of a mechanized
Utopia and, while the film is
absurd in many of its details, it is
impressive for its visual design,
notably for the geometric layout
of masses of people.
Though Clive has left, his film
series will continue in Geology
3 20. From now on, however,
there will be just one film per
week, to be shown twice on
Tuesday nights. This week: the
superb screen adaptation of Lilian
Hellman's The Little Foxes.
Directed by William Wyler and
photographed by Gregg Toland

(Citizen Kane), the film offers
Bette Davis in her prime as
Regina. An example of
Hollywood craftsmanship at its
best.
Salt of the Earth will be shown
in Cubberley on Thursday at
4:15. This 1953 film is a realistic
look at the plight of
Mexican-American families- in our
Southwest, concentrating on a
miners' strike in 1951-52. The
writer, producer and directed
were blacklisted from Hollywood
for the "communist propoganda"
supposedly present in their
picture.
