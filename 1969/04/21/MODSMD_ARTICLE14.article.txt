# Menlo Students Ask Changes
## 
### 
At a rally last Thursday night
the students of Menlo College
abolished their student council
and, at another rally the following
day, they worked out a list of
demands which were sent ot their
board of trustees. Brune Arnold, a
student at Menlo, estimated that
about one-third to one-half of the
student body supports the
demands. In an attempt to explain
the urgency of student concern,
the letter to the Menlo trustees
said"
"The administration is not
cognizant to the implications of
their own actions concerning
procedures of campus
government. We realize there are
no easy answers to these pressing
problems, but we seek innovation,
not the substitution of blue tape
for red. The college which wishes
to set an example of
open-minded inquiry in its
classrooms will defeat its purpose
if it denies the same right of
inquiry to its students outside the
classroom—or if it imposes rules
which deny them the freedom to

make their own choices, wise or
unwise. We are not confused
children, uncertain of our motives
or aims, but determined adults
who have found our educational
institution seriously wanting. We
hope that through constructive
cooperation that a better Menlo
will result for the benefit of our
academic community.
We believe that the above
problems and proposed solutions
reflect the prevailing attitude of
the Student Body. The future of
student government will depend
on the administration's response
to this statement. An immediate
response is the determining factor
in establishing an efficient,
meaningful, and relevant student
government. The urgency of a
reply necessitates a letter
addressed to the Student Body,
delivered through campus mail
Monday afternoon, April 21,
1969.
In an article last fall, the Daily
referred to Menlo as a
"Prep-school with ash-trays" and
as a second-chance school for

"late bloomers." Menlo's student
demands represent a concerted,
but extremely moderate attempt,
to change that image.
Demands under "Lack of
Communication" include the
establishment of "a better and
closer relationship" with the
Atherton Town Council,
improvement of the counseling
service ("possibly hiring a part
time psychologist"), and more
student voice in new building
projects.
Students complain of a number
of lesser ineonveneinces under the
heading "Lack of Cooperation."
But they also urge a broader
curriculum in some areas,
especially in Subject A
"Bonehead" English course.

board of trustees. Brune Arnold, a
student at Menlo, estimated that
about one-third to one-half of the
student body supports the
demands. In an attempt to explain
the urgency of student concern,
the letter to the Menlo trustees
said"
"The administration is not
cognizant to the implications of
their own actions concerning
procedures of campus
government. We realize there are
no easy answers to these pressing
problems, but we seek innovation,
not the substitution of blue tape
for red. The college which wishes
to set an example of
open-minded inquiry in its
classrooms will defeat its purpose
if it denies the same right of
inquiry to its students outside the
classroom—or if it imposes rules
which deny them the freedom to

make their own choices, wise or
unwise. We are not confused
children, uncertain of our motives
or aims, but determined adults
who have found our educational
institution seriously wanting. We
hope that through constructive
cooperation that a better Menlo
will result for the benefit of our
academic community.
We believe that the above
problems and proposed solutions
reflect the prevailing attitude of
the Student Body. The future of
student government will depend
on the administration's response
to this statement. An immediate
response is the determining factor
in establishing an efficient,
meaningful, and relevant student
government. The urgency of a
reply necessitates a letter
addressed to the Student Body,
delivered through campus mail
Monday afternoon, April 21,
1969.
In an article last fall, the Daily
referred to Menlo as a
"Prep-school with ash-trays" and
as a second-chance school for

"late bloomers." Menlo's student
demands represent a concerted,
but extremely moderate attempt,
to change that image.
Demands under "Lack of
Communication" include the
establishment of "a better and
closer relationship" with the
Atherton Town Council,
improvement of the counseling
service ("possibly hiring a part
time psychologist"), and more
student voice in new building
projects.
Students complain of a number
of lesser ineonveneinces under the
heading "Lack of Cooperation."
But they also urge a broader
curriculum in some areas,
especially in Subject A
"Bonehead" English course.
