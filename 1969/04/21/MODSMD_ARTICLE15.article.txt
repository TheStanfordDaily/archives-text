# SCLC Stand
## 
### 
A letter has been forwarded to
President Pitzer, the Stanford
Judicial Council, and LASSU by
professor Robert Horn, acting
chairman of the Student Conduct
Legislative Council, stating:
"It is our sense that this rule is
in accord with current University
and Judicial Council policy. We
propose this rule only so that we
may amplify and clarify
understanding of those policies."
The rule states: "No student
may be subjected to any
disciplinary sanction for any
violation of any Rule of the
SCLC, any ASSU by-law, or any
University regulation or policy
and has had an opportunity for a
hearing before Stanford Judicial
Council as to all issues necessary
to establish such violation; no
determination resulting from any
other hearing shall be deemed to
dispose of any such issue."
