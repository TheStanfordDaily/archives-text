# Military Recruiters Facing Difficulties
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Antiwar feelings are -cutting
into officer recruitment for the
armed forces according to military
officials.
The Marine Corps estimates
tnat it will fall 300 to 400 men
short of the 4,000 new officers
needed each year.
The Army and Air Force also
report some difficulties this year
but not as serious.
The armed forces send
recruiters each spring to more
than 500 colleges and universities.
They are looking for recruits for
Officers Candidate School (OCS),
which trains officers in six months
after 4 1 /n months of basic training.
After completing OCS the new
officer serves two years on active
duty.
The army is attempting to get
an all-college graduate officer
corps. It is presently about 75%
college graduates.

Last week two army recruiting
officers, Capt. James Laqrence
and Sgt. John J. Strunks were on
campus to talk with students
interested in OCS. Capt. Lawrence
explained that they don't actually
sign any papers on campus so it
isn't technically recruiting.
They both denied that they
had encounter a drop in OCS
interest this year. Sgt. Strunks
said that the number of people he
talked to at Stanford last year was
lower than in 1967, but that this
year's number was back up to the
'67 level.
Capt. Lawrence said that he
had found that any publicity he
received, even heckling, was good.
He explained that at Berkeley,
interest in the program increased j
dramatically after he was the
target of a demonstration.
He said that in touring colleges
and universities in northern
California he had run into some
opposition, but never at Stanford.
The Army Recruiting
Command at Ft. Monroe, Va., has
said that selection teams have
been barred from recruiting at the
Peabody Institute in Baltimore,
Md. and have received word from
administrators at 20 other colleges
to skip their scheduled visits
because of campus unrest.

The Army hopes to return to
the 20 schools in the future but is

General Leonard F. Chapman
Jr., Marine Corps Comniandant,
commented that on some
campuses college administrators
had displayed an "apparent lack
of cooperation, failing to make
available adequate time and
central locations for Marine
recruiters."
At Stanford, recruiters are
given space in the Placement
Service building adjoining White
Plaza. They distributed recruiting
materials to about a dozen
persons last Tuesday and
Wednesday.

Capt. Lawrence generally
discounted these problems,
explaining that more and more
people were interested in OCS as a
draft alternative. He said that
admission to OCS can be
guaranteed to a college graduate.

lower than in 1967, but that this
year's number was back up to the
'67 level.
Capt. Lawrence said that he
had found that any publicity he
received, even heckling, was good.
He explained that at Berkeley,
interest in the program increased j
dramatically after he was the
target of a demonstration.
He said that in touring colleges
and universities in northern
California he had run into some
opposition, but never at Stanford.
The Army Recruiting
Command at Ft. Monroe, Va., has
said that selection teams have
been barred from recruiting at the
Peabody Institute in Baltimore,

Failure to Cooperate

The Army hopes to return to
the 20 schools in the future but is
not forcing the issue.
General Leonard F. Chapman
Jr., Marine Corps Comniandant,
commented that on some
campuses college administrators
had displayed an "apparent lack
of cooperation, failing to make
available adequate time and
central locations for Marine
recruiters."
At Stanford, recruiters are
given space in the Placement
Service building adjoining White
Plaza. They distributed recruiting
materials to about a dozen
persons last Tuesday and
Wednesday.

Capt. Lawrence generally
discounted these problems,
explaining that more and more
people were interested in OCS as a
draft alternative. He said that
admission to OCS can be
guaranteed to a college graduate.
Antiwar feelings are -cutting
into officer recruitment for the
armed forces according to military
officials.
The Marine Corps estimates
tnat it will fall 300 to 400 men
short of the 4,000 new officers
needed each year.
The Army and Air Force also
report some difficulties this year
but not as serious.
The armed forces send
recruiters each spring to more
than 500 colleges and universities.
They are looking for recruits for
Officers Candidate School (OCS),
which trains officers in six months
after 4 1 /n months of basic training.
After completing OCS the new
officer serves two years on active
duty.
The army is attempting to get
an all-college graduate officer
corps. It is presently about 75%
college graduates.

Last week two army recruiting
officers, Capt. James Laqrence
and Sgt. John J. Strunks were on
campus to talk with students
interested in OCS. Capt. Lawrence
explained that they don't actually
sign any papers on campus so it
isn't technically recruiting.
They both denied that they
had encounter a drop in OCS
interest this year. Sgt. Strunks
said that the number of people he
talked to at Stanford last year was
lower than in 1967, but that this
year's number was back up to the
'67 level.
