# Theater Program On Tap This Week
## 
### 
Two plays, one exposing the
bizarre sexual games of graduate
students and the other revealing
the mystical visions of William
Blake, will be presented this week
by the Department of Speech and
Drama at Stanford University.

"The Wager," a two-act
comic-drama by Mark Medoff,
and"The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell," a dramatization of Blake's
visionary poem, will play April
23-26 at 8 p.m. in The Nitery.
Admission is free.
The two presentations are
acting and directing projects of
Master of Fine Arts and
undergraduate drama students of
the Department. William
Frankfather, a first year MFA
candidate, is directing "The
Wager" while Jay Morse, a senior
in drama is directing "The
Marriage of Heaven and Hell."
"The Wager" is an original play
by Mark Medoff who received his
Master of Arts degree in English
from Stanford in 1966.
"The Wager" explores the
secret, often absurd, lives of four
graduate students. Two
roommates bet that their
neighbor's wife will be divorced
and remarried to one of them
within a month. The wife,
curiously called Honor, cannot
seem to live up to her name.
Blake: Energy vs Control
Blake's poem, "The Marriage
of Heaven and Hell" has been
transformed into a unique
theatrical experiment under the
direction of Jay Morse. Utilizing
the multi-media potentials of slide
projections, film, movement,
music, and mime, the five visions
of Blake's subconscious are
created. The Chorus of Hell,
representing the Energies,
provides cohesion to the work
with its chanting and writhings.
The poem has been adapted for
the stage by Jay Morse and
Francis Perry. Rich Carp appears
as Conscious Blake, Pat Dillon as
dream Black, Rick Hanson as the
Devil, and Ralph Earle as the
Angel.
