# East Menlo Park Erupts; Police Quell Disturbances
## 
### 
"It was just another neighborhood
fight, except it was between a black and
a white," according to the Rev. Albert
Williams, a black minister. But the result
was considerable tension in East Menlo
Park yesterday afternoon and evening
after a fight between a white youth and
several black youths. East Menlo Park is
a predominately black area, part o£ the
city of Menlo Park and adjacent to East
Palo Alto.
According to Menlo Park Police
Chief Victor Cizanckas, police were
called to a fight at 54 Henderson Place
at approximately three p.m. They
arrived to break up a fight between a
white youth and, according to the
police, some twenty black youths.
The white, Ernie Silva, had been
visiting at the home of Larry C. Austin,
54 Henderson Place. The Austins are
white. Neither Silva or the blacks were
willing to discuss the fight, and the
police left the area after telling the
Austins that they would return to
evacuate them from the area if they
desired.
About 40 minutes later the police
received a call that more fighting had
broken out at the same address. Two
police officers responded and observed a
crowd of between thirty and forty.
According to Chief Cizanckas a black
woman, Mrs. Dosha Lee Curry, then
tried to attack Mr. Austin with a tire
iron. When an officer intervened Mrs.
Curry allegedly then tried to attack the
officer.
The officer, Michael Forrest, then
"put his hands on her" which, according
to Cizanckas, led to a flurry of rocks
from the gathered crowd. Two more
police cars were dispatched to the scene
and the crowd allegedly closed in on the
officers. •

Some black community leaders
disagreed. They reported that they had
seen no rocks thrown, but they said
they had not been there during the
entire chain of events.
At this point, according to police,
Mrs. Curry's thirteen year old son,
Robert, attempted to stab officer
Forrest in the back with a knife. Both
Mrs. Curry and her son were arrested
and the Austins were evacuated from
their home.
Ten officers were reportedly trapped
by the crowd at the end of the dead-end
street with their cars. Thirty officers
were sent in on foot to aid the others.
The police left the area, making no
further arrests.
Stanford Police Car
Action then shifted to the nearby
intersection of Henderson St.and Ivy
Place where one police car had stalled.
It was a Stanford Police unit that had
responded to a call for mutual aid from
the Menlo Park police. At this point a
Menlo Park officer fired four shotgun
blasts into the air to disperse the crowd
and the disabled Stanford car was
pushed from the area by a Highway
Patrol unit.
At this time, according to Chief
Cizanckas, the crowd in the area
numbered some two to three hundred.
In the skuffles that followed two police
officers were reported to have been
slightly injured, one with a possible
broken collarbone and another with a
lacerated ear.
Police were then withdrawn from the
area to see if the crowd would disperse.
Shortly thereafter police received a call
that the Austin house was being looted.

Four police cars then responded and
went to the scene. Soon after four more
four-car units were dispatched to help
stop the looting.
Looters Halted
According to Cizanckas, when police
tactical units returned to the scene the
house had been broken into and many
of its possessions, including a television
set were being removed. Police halted
the alleged looting and reportedly
replaced the possessions in the house.
No arrests were made at this time.
Cizanckas ordered four cars to
remain at the scene to prevent further*
looting and two of the cars were still
there at ten last night.
The reason for the fight was not
entjrely clear. Cizanckas said there had
apparently been a running feud between
The Austins and neighbors.
At the height of the tension an
estimated 175 officers had been called.
Most of them remained at a staging area
at the Willow School. Officers called
were from several jurisdictions including
South San Francisco, Stanford, and the
Highway Patrol in San Jose.
"It was just another neighborhood
fight, except it was between a black and

slightly injured, one with a possible
broken collarbone and another with a
lacerated ear.
Police were then withdrawn from the
area to see if the crowd would disperse.
Shortly thereafter police received a call
that the Austin house was being looted.

Four police cars then responded and
went to the scene. Soon after four more
four-car units were dispatched to help
stop the looting.
Looters Halted
According to Cizanckas, when police
tactical units returned to the scene the
house had been broken into and many
of its possessions, including a television
set were being removed. Police halted
the alleged looting and reportedly
replaced the possessions in the house.
No arrests were made at this time.
Cizanckas ordered four cars to
remain at the scene to prevent further*
looting and two of the cars were still
there at ten last night.
The reason for the fight was not
entjrely clear. Cizanckas said there had
apparently been a running feud between
The Austins and neighbors.
At the height of the tension an
estimated 175 officers had been called.
Most of them remained at a staging area
at the Willow School. Officers called
were from several jurisdictions including
South San Francisco, Stanford, and the
Highway Patrol in San Jose.
"It was just another neighborhood
fight, except it was between a black and
a white," according to the Rev. Albert
Williams, a black minister. But the result
was considerable tension in East Menlo
Park yesterday afternoon and evening
after a fight between a white youth and
several black youths. East Menlo Park is
a predominately black area, part o£ the
city of Menlo Park and adjacent to East
Palo Alto.
According to Menlo Park Police
Chief Victor Cizanckas, police were
called to a fight at 54 Henderson Place
at approximately three p.m. They
arrived to break up a fight between a
white youth and, according to the
police, some twenty black youths.
The white, Ernie Silva, had been
visiting at the home of Larry C. Austin,
54 Henderson Place. The Austins are
white. Neither Silva or the blacks were
willing to discuss the fight, and the
police left the area after telling the
Austins that they would return to
evacuate them from the area if they
desired.
About 40 minutes later the police
received a call that more fighting had
broken out at the same address. Two
police officers responded and observed a
crowd of between thirty and forty.
According to Chief Cizanckas a black
woman, Mrs. Dosha Lee Curry, then
tried to attack Mr. Austin with a tire
iron. When an officer intervened Mrs.
Curry allegedly then tried to attack the
officer.
The officer, Michael Forrest, then
"put his hands on her" which, according
to Cizanckas, led to a flurry of rocks
from the gathered crowd. Two more
police cars were dispatched to the scene
and the crowd allegedly closed in on the
officers. •

Some black community leaders
disagreed. They reported that they had
seen no rocks thrown, but they said
they had not been there during the
entire chain of events.
At this point, according to police,
Mrs. Curry's thirteen year old son,
Robert, attempted to stab officer
Forrest in the back with a knife. Both
Mrs. Curry and her son were arrested
and the Austins were evacuated from
their home.
Ten officers were reportedly trapped
by the crowd at the end of the dead-end
street with their cars. Thirty officers
were sent in on foot to aid the others.
The police left the area, making no
further arrests.
Stanford Police Car
Action then shifted to the nearby
intersection of Henderson St.and Ivy
Place where one police car had stalled.
It was a Stanford Police unit that had
responded to a call for mutual aid from
the Menlo Park police. At this point a
Menlo Park officer fired four shotgun
blasts into the air to disperse the crowd
and the disabled Stanford car was
pushed from the area by a Highway
Patrol unit.
At this time, according to Chief
Cizanckas, the crowd in the area
numbered some two to three hundred.
In the skuffles that followed two police
officers were reported to have been
slightly injured, one with a possible
broken collarbone and another with a
lacerated ear.
Police were then withdrawn from the
area to see if the crowd would disperse.
