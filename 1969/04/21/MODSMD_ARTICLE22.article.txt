# Baseball Highlights Sad Sports Weekend
## 
### FRED MANN 
Although it is being attacked
by every corner, baseball is still
regarded as the "national
pastime." At least it is at
Stanford.
Had it not been for Coach Ray
Young's varsity baseball sweep
this weekend, the sports picture
on the Farm would have been
bleak indeed. USC's track team
came to Palo Alto and wiped up,
the Trojan tennis squad joined
with UCLA in murdering the
Indian netters, and Washington's
powerful crew nailed the Stanford
contingent in the varsity, JV, and
frosh events.
The Sunken Diamond provided
the only athletic consolation for
Tribe backers, but it was quite a
consolation. By knocking off
Oregon State Friday afternoon,
and then sweeping a doubleheader

from the Oregon Ducks in the
Saturday sunshine, the Indians
moved into undisputed possession
of first place in the Pacific-8. The
glovers hold a 5-1 record for a one
game lead over both California
and USC.
Pitching Perfection
Phil Keller started the weekend
off with an impressive six-hit
shutout of the Beavers, 4-0. The
strong, righthanded junior struck
out 11, and Chuck Williams
clouted a two-run double in the
bottom of the third to put the
game out of the reach of
outclassed OSU. The fast balling
Keller went the distance for the
win.
Saturday, it was again Stanford
pitching that proved to be the
difference, as Oregon fell 2-1 and
3-0. Bob Boone threw the first

game tor the L-ards and limited
the Ducks to only four hits and a
run. Sparked by a Jack Hodges
home run, the Indians rallied for
the come-from-beh ind win.
Stanford committed three errors
in the extra-inning contest and
mustered only three hits, but it
was good enough for the
important victory.
The second game featured
Tribe ace Rod Poteete blanking
the visitors with a superb
five-hitter. This Lime, the Indians
collected seven hits, plus some
good news from Los Angeles.
Washington State was dumped in
the first game of their
doubleheader with mighty USC,
9-0, but came back to win the
nightcap, 3-1, and give Stanford
the conference lead all alone.
The spoiling Cougars visit
Stanford todav for a Monda

doubleheader starting at 12:30
p.m. Tomorrow Washington plays
a 3:00 p.m. game.
Track Trouble
At the same time the baseball
team was taking Oregon twice, the
Stanford track team was again
falling short, this time very short.
V ern Wolfe's USC national
champions overpowered the
Cards, 111-43, in what was a long
but interesting afternoon for
Stanford mentor Payton .Jordan,
The Trojans swept to wins in
every running event and held the
Tribe to but three individual
victories. Southern Cal ran their
dual meet winning streak over
Stanford to 34.
Tribe Takes Three
Jim Kauffman won the long
jump (2 3-s'/2), Lance Martin
threw the farthest of his li'e in the

javelin to win with 222-3, and big
Steve Davis heaved the discus
175*11 lor a victory margin of
nearly four feet. That was it. USC
won the rest.
Tom Massey came close in the
triple jump and held third in the
high jump. But it was SC speed
and depth that made it really no
contest. Pole vaulter Bob Seagren
won the 440 hurdles for a change
of pace, and Stanford's Rick
Tipton lost the 120 highs for the
first time all year.
Net Defeats
Tennis was no better for the
Tribe as USC and UCLA proved
why they are the top teams in the
country. Friday the Bruins beat
the home court Indians, 8-1, with
only John Spiegel coming up with
a win. He captured the third
singles, 6-4, 6-4.

The Trojans also defeated
Coach Dick Gould's team, 6-3.
Again Spiegel won his singles, and
Chuck Alloo won his, 6-0, 6-0.
Stanford's final doubles team of
Schlobom and Atkins won by
default. SC's Bob Lutz was
unbeatable in the prime singles
match as he downed Dean
Schlobom 9-7, 6-4, and powerful
Jaquin Layomayo destroyed Stan
Pasarell 6-2, 6-2.
Crew Drowned
Even the Stanford crew fell
over the weekend. Washington's
squads won at all levels of
competition in the five school
races in Eugene. The Huskies
swept to a 7:20.4 victory in the
varsity division with Stanford
second in 7:24.4. Oregon State
was third with Pacific Lutheran
fourth and host Oregon last.

One other big winner was the
often overlooked Stanford
lacrosse team. The undefeated
stickers clobbered hapless Oregon,
13-0. In an earlier meeting, the
Tribe had been victorious, 18-1.
