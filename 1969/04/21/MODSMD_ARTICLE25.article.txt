# 12 Fines Paid
## 
### 
In response to news inquiries,
University officials disclosed last
Monday (April 14) that 12 of the
29 students found guilty of
disrupting the trustee meeting in
the Faculty Club last January
have paid the fines that were
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council, a group composed of
students and faculty members.
The University did not disclose
the names of those that have paid
fines.
The Judicial Council's decision
stipulated that one-half of their
fines had to be paid before
individuals would be allowed to
register for the spring quarter. The
remainder of these fines must be
paid before the end of the quarter
in June. Before the beginning of
this quarter, half of the $1,900
due in fines was collected and
given to the Black Panther Party
by the students who were found
guilty last winter. These students
objected to the Judicial Council's
decision that the money be given
to the Martin Luther King Fund.
