# ASSU Poll Indicates Students Favor Sit-In
## 
### 
Stanford students overwhelmingly
think the sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory "has helped
focus the attention of the University
upon the nature of research conducted
at Stanford." They also voted by a
margin of 1633 votes to 1468 to
participate in a "sit-in or similar action
of protest" if Trustees do not take
appropriate action by May 14.
The vote was taken in a poll
conducted among students present at
Frost Amphitheater Friday afternoon in
a special meeting of the student body
called by ASSU president Denis Hayes.
It came on the heals of the
conclusion of the nine-day sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory which
ended Friday morning. Six hundred
students participating in an early
morning meeting indicated that they
would resume if they did not get an
acceptable response to their demands
concerning military research within a
week.
In the afternoon meeting at Frost the
slim majority of students indicated they
would participate "in a sit-in or similar
means of protest" if Stanford Trustees
do not "positively respond to the desire
of the Stanford Community regarding
research at Stanford and SRI and in
resolving the future relationship
between Stanford and SRI by May 14."
The precise vote on the question of
the sit-in helping focus attention upon
research was 3073 saying it did and 203
saying it didn't.
The end to the sit-in came just
preceding a meeting of the full
Academic Council in which the
Stanford faculty gave President Kenneth
S. Pitzer a standing ovation for his
"restraint and firmness" in dealing with
the sit-in.
Later Friday afternoon, President
Pitzer announced that "the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is closed until
12 noon April 25th."

In v.ther questions students voted in
a four part question to oppose
biochemical warfare,
counlt insurgency, war-related and
classified research. The margin on
biochemical warfare research was 2732
to 475. On counter-insurgency it was
2395 to 772 while of war related
research it was 2414 to 684.
The closest vote was on the question
of classified research in general. Here
the vote was more than 2 to 1 with the
exact tally showing 2120 against
classified research and 1045 in favor of
it.
In other votes, students voted by a
margin of 2207 to 970 supporting a
cancellation of classes Tuesday to allow
a full day of speeches, rallies and
seminars on research in universities.
Make Decision
By a margin of 2630 to 572 students
urged the Trustees to make their
decision regarding SRI no later than
their May 13 meeting.
The final question on the ballot
asked whether students polled would
participate in "an Education Center in
the Old Union Courtyard as a base from
which to inform the University
community on the nature of research
being conducted at Stanford and SRI."

exact tally showing 2120 against
classified research and 1045 in favor of
it.
In other votes, students voted by a
margin of 2207 to 970 supporting a
cancellation of classes Tuesday to allow
a full day of speeches, rallies and
seminars on research in universities.
Make Decision
By a margin of 2630 to 572 students
urged the Trustees to make their
decision regarding SRI no later than
their May 13 meeting.
The final question on the ballot
asked whether students polled would
participate in "an Education Center in
the Old Union Courtyard as a base from
which to inform the University
community on the nature of research
being conducted at Stanford and SRI."
Stanford students overwhelmingly
think the sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory "has helped
focus the attention of the University
upon the nature of research conducted
at Stanford." They also voted by a
margin of 1633 votes to 1468 to
participate in a "sit-in or similar action
of protest" if Trustees do not take
appropriate action by May 14.
The vote was taken in a poll
conducted among students present at
Frost Amphitheater Friday afternoon in
a special meeting of the student body
called by ASSU president Denis Hayes.
It came on the heals of the
conclusion of the nine-day sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory which
ended Friday morning. Six hundred
students participating in an early
morning meeting indicated that they
would resume if they did not get an
acceptable response to their demands
concerning military research within a
week.
In the afternoon meeting at Frost the
slim majority of students indicated they
would participate "in a sit-in or similar
means of protest" if Stanford Trustees
do not "positively respond to the desire
of the Stanford Community regarding
research at Stanford and SRI and in
resolving the future relationship
between Stanford and SRI by May 14."
The precise vote on the question of
the sit-in helping focus attention upon
research was 3073 saying it did and 203
saying it didn't.
The end to the sit-in came just
preceding a meeting of the full
Academic Council in which the
Stanford faculty gave President Kenneth
S. Pitzer a standing ovation for his
"restraint and firmness" in dealing with
the sit-in.
Later Friday afternoon, President
Pitzer announced that "the Applied
Electronics Laboratory is closed until
12 noon April 25th."

In v.ther questions students voted in
a four part question to oppose
biochemical warfare,
counlt insurgency, war-related and
classified research. The margin on
biochemical warfare research was 2732
to 475. On counter-insurgency it was
2395 to 772 while of war related
research it was 2414 to 684.
The closest vote was on the question
of classified research in general. Here
the vote was more than 2 to 1 with the
exact tally showing 2120 against
classified research and 1045 in favor of
it.
