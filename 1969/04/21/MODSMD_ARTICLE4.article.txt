# Planned Parenthood Problems
## Clinic Hurt By Budget 
### SUE SWARD 
Santa Clara County is a county
beseiged with birth control problems.
The San Jose Planned Parenthood
Clinic —in existence since 1963 -must
handle its own geographic area, and in
addition, it must serve many individuals
from Santa Cruz County, which has no
clinic.
The newly-established Palo Alto
Planned Parenthood Clinic in the
northern end of the county faces much
the same problem because San Mateo
County has no clinic either.
Add to the Palo Alto Clinic's
problems the fact that it is presently
operating on a less-than-adequate
budget with an under-sized staff.
Compound these problems with the
observation that the Stanford Health
Center is not helping the situation any
by simply referring interested co-eds to
the Palo Alto Clinic, and you have the
picture of a birth control clinic
operating under less than ideal
conditions.
Ultimately, it is Planned
Parenthood's goal to get out of the
business of running clinics and into the
educational, informational side of the
operation, according to Fran Bioletti, a
small but vibrant woman who is in
charge of Planned Parenthood publicity
for the county.
No Government Aid
The federal government is not
helping Planned Parenthood's move in
this direction, Mrs. Bioletti maintains.
For the year 1969 the federal
government is not contributing any
money toward the Santa Clara County
Planned Parenthood. Last year the clinic
did have a $5,000 federal grant, but this
year that money has been cut off.
"Money is our main problem," Mrs.
Bioletti observed. Because the clinic is
presently so short of its minimum
budget mark of $50,000 for the current
year, it is operating with the largest
volunteer staff and smallest paid staff of
any clinic in the Bay Area.
Operating on such a tight budget, the
Palo Alto clinic wants to focus the great
part of its effort on the poor woman
who does not want to have any more
babies because her family's income
cannot support another child.
Poor First Concern
"Though the residences of the
patients coming to the clinic doesn't
matter," Mrs. Bioletti said, "we are
really trying to help out the poor
woman rather than the Stanford co-eds.

We are happy to help the co-eds, but we
wish the Stanford Health Center would
wake up and see the light."
Dr. James McClenahan, Director of
the Stanford Health Center, says that
the Center's policy on distribution of
contraceptives is under review.
Stanford's legal counsel is presently
looking into the legality of passing out
contraceptives to minors, and a decision
on the question may be expected by
next fall.
Special Programs
Growing out of the Palo Alto clinic's
focus on the underprivileged women are
several programs headed by Mrs. Pat
Miller, the wife of a Stanford faculty
member.
Mrs. Miller says that she is working
dutifully to increase the number of
women reached by the Palo Alto clinic.
Since it opened on February 5, the
clinic has had 141 clients.
The projects in effect range from
speaking at Stanford dorms to sending a
community worker into the
Mexican-American sections of the
county to prosletize for birth control
among the Catholic women there. A
birth control education program is also
in effect in the jail in Milpitas for the
young women confined there.
"Most Catholic women say they
don't want big families," Mrs. Miller
noted, "so they just can't be concerned
with the Pope's stand on this point.
Word-of-N!outli Publicity
Mrs. Bioletti believes that the
voluntary aspect of treatment at
Planned Parenthood seems to make a
positive impression on Catholics
observing the clinic's operation in the
county. According to Mrs. Bioletti,
word-of-mouth publicity about the
importance of contraceptives is the best
kind of publicity the clinic can get.
She remembers a Mexican woman
who came into the San Jose clinic
almost in tears and said to a staff
member, "I just learned today that I
don't have to have a seventh baby."
Little or no work has been done with
the Fast Palo Alto community. Though
some women do come to the clinic from
that area, there is a city-government
supported clinic in the community that
does dispense pills.
PA Clinic Inactive
The Palo Alto Clinic has done no
active prosletizing in East Palo Alto
"because of the touchy political
situation involved," Mrs. Miller said. She

is referring here to the much-reported
reaction against birth control by some
black power advocates. This point of
view sees bith control as a form of white
racism and racial genocide.
Faced with a small budget and a large
number of perspective clients, Mrs.
Bioletti says that the clinic is hoping for
what she calls a "snowball effect." More
and more people will hopefully hear
about the clinic and contribute time and
money to it. Through this process, the
clinic will become "an on-going
concern" that more individuals will
come to respect.
Mrs. Bioletti shook h?r head. "It may
seem perfectly obvious to us." she said.
"We've listened to Paul Erlich. But
we've got to do something about the
woman who wants to have six babies
and who can't afford to have them."

and who can't afford to have them."


BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC-A mother with two of her four children enters the San Jose Clinic
for an interview.
Santa Clara County is a county
beseiged with birth control problems.
The San Jose Planned Parenthood
Clinic —in existence since 1963 -must
handle its own geographic area, and in
addition, it must serve many individuals
from Santa Cruz County, which has no
clinic.
The newly-established Palo Alto
Planned Parenthood Clinic in the
northern end of the county faces much
the same problem because San Mateo
County has no clinic either.
Add to the Palo Alto Clinic's
problems the fact that it is presently
operating on a less-than-adequate
budget with an under-sized staff.
Compound these problems with the
observation that the Stanford Health
Center is not helping the situation any
by simply referring interested co-eds to
the Palo Alto Clinic, and you have the
picture of a birth control clinic
operating under less than ideal
conditions.
Ultimately, it is Planned
Parenthood's goal to get out of the
business of running clinics and into the
educational, informational side of the
operation, according to Fran Bioletti, a
small but vibrant woman who is in
charge of Planned Parenthood publicity
for the county.
No Government Aid
The federal government is not
helping Planned Parenthood's move in
this direction, Mrs. Bioletti maintains.
For the year 1969 the federal
government is not contributing any
money toward the Santa Clara County
Planned Parenthood. Last year the clinic
did have a $5,000 federal grant, but this
year that money has been cut off.
"Money is our main problem," Mrs.
Bioletti observed. Because the clinic is
presently so short of its minimum
budget mark of $50,000 for the current
year, it is operating with the largest
volunteer staff and smallest paid staff of
any clinic in the Bay Area.
Operating on such a tight budget, the
Palo Alto clinic wants to focus the great
part of its effort on the poor woman
who does not want to have any more
babies because her family's income
cannot support another child.
Poor First Concern
"Though the residences of the
patients coming to the clinic doesn't
matter," Mrs. Bioletti said, "we are
really trying to help out the poor
woman rather than the Stanford co-eds.

We are happy to help the co-eds, but we
wish the Stanford Health Center would
wake up and see the light."
Dr. James McClenahan, Director of
the Stanford Health Center, says that
the Center's policy on distribution of
contraceptives is under review.
Stanford's legal counsel is presently
looking into the legality of passing out
contraceptives to minors, and a decision
on the question may be expected by
next fall.
Special Programs
Growing out of the Palo Alto clinic's
focus on the underprivileged women are
several programs headed by Mrs. Pat
Miller, the wife of a Stanford faculty
member.
Mrs. Miller says that she is working
dutifully to increase the number of
women reached by the Palo Alto clinic.
Since it opened on February 5, the
clinic has had 141 clients.
The projects in effect range from
speaking at Stanford dorms to sending a
community worker into the
Mexican-American sections of the
county to prosletize for birth control
among the Catholic women there. A
birth control education program is also
in effect in the jail in Milpitas for the
young women confined there.
"Most Catholic women say they
don't want big families," Mrs. Miller
noted, "so they just can't be concerned
with the Pope's stand on this point.
Word-of-N!outli Publicity
Mrs. Bioletti believes that the
voluntary aspect of treatment at
Planned Parenthood seems to make a
positive impression on Catholics
observing the clinic's operation in the
county. According to Mrs. Bioletti,
word-of-mouth publicity about the
importance of contraceptives is the best
kind of publicity the clinic can get.
She remembers a Mexican woman
who came into the San Jose clinic
almost in tears and said to a staff
member, "I just learned today that I
don't have to have a seventh baby."
Little or no work has been done with
the Fast Palo Alto community. Though
some women do come to the clinic from
that area, there is a city-government
supported clinic in the community that
does dispense pills.
PA Clinic Inactive
The Palo Alto Clinic has done no
active prosletizing in East Palo Alto
"because of the touchy political
situation involved," Mrs. Miller said. She

is referring here to the much-reported
reaction against birth control by some
black power advocates. This point of
view sees bith control as a form of white
racism and racial genocide.
Faced with a small budget and a large
number of perspective clients, Mrs.
Bioletti says that the clinic is hoping for
what she calls a "snowball effect." More
and more people will hopefully hear
about the clinic and contribute time and
money to it. Through this process, the
clinic will become "an on-going
concern" that more individuals will
come to respect.
Mrs. Bioletti shook h?r head. "It may
seem perfectly obvious to us." she said.
"We've listened to Paul Erlich. But
we've got to do something about the
woman who wants to have six babies
and who can't afford to have them."

BIRTH CONTROL CLINIC-A mother with two of her four children enters the San Jose Clinic
for an interview.
Santa Clara County is a county
beseiged with birth control problems.
The San Jose Planned Parenthood
Clinic —in existence since 1963 -must
handle its own geographic area, and in
addition, it must serve many individuals
from Santa Cruz County, which has no
clinic.
The newly-established Palo Alto
Planned Parenthood Clinic in the
northern end of the county faces much
the same problem because San Mateo
County has no clinic either.
Add to the Palo Alto Clinic's
problems the fact that it is presently
operating on a less-than-adequate
budget with an under-sized staff.
Compound these problems with the
observation that the Stanford Health
Center is not helping the situation any
by simply referring interested co-eds to
the Palo Alto Clinic, and you have the
picture of a birth control clinic
operating under less than ideal
conditions.
Ultimately, it is Planned
Parenthood's goal to get out of the
business of running clinics and into the
educational, informational side of the
operation, according to Fran Bioletti, a
small but vibrant woman who is in
charge of Planned Parenthood publicity
for the county.
No Government Aid
The federal government is not
helping Planned Parenthood's move in
this direction, Mrs. Bioletti maintains.
For the year 1969 the federal
government is not contributing any
money toward the Santa Clara County
Planned Parenthood. Last year the clinic
did have a $5,000 federal grant, but this
year that money has been cut off.
"Money is our main problem," Mrs.
Bioletti observed. Because the clinic is
presently so short of its minimum
budget mark of $50,000 for the current
year, it is operating with the largest
volunteer staff and smallest paid staff of
any clinic in the Bay Area.
Operating on such a tight budget, the
Palo Alto clinic wants to focus the great
part of its effort on the poor woman
who does not want to have any more
babies because her family's income
cannot support another child.
Poor First Concern
"Though the residences of the
patients coming to the clinic doesn't
matter," Mrs. Bioletti said, "we are
really trying to help out the poor
woman rather than the Stanford co-eds.

We are happy to help the co-eds, but we
wish the Stanford Health Center would
wake up and see the light."
Dr. James McClenahan, Director of
the Stanford Health Center, says that
the Center's policy on distribution of
contraceptives is under review.
Stanford's legal counsel is presently
looking into the legality of passing out
contraceptives to minors, and a decision
on the question may be expected by
next fall.
Special Programs
Growing out of the Palo Alto clinic's
focus on the underprivileged women are
several programs headed by Mrs. Pat
Miller, the wife of a Stanford faculty
member.
Mrs. Miller says that she is working
dutifully to increase the number of
women reached by the Palo Alto clinic.
Since it opened on February 5, the
clinic has had 141 clients.
The projects in effect range from
speaking at Stanford dorms to sending a
community worker into the
Mexican-American sections of the
county to prosletize for birth control
among the Catholic women there. A
birth control education program is also
in effect in the jail in Milpitas for the
young women confined there.
"Most Catholic women say they
don't want big families," Mrs. Miller
noted, "so they just can't be concerned
with the Pope's stand on this point.
Word-of-N!outli Publicity
Mrs. Bioletti believes that the
voluntary aspect of treatment at
Planned Parenthood seems to make a
positive impression on Catholics
observing the clinic's operation in the
county. According to Mrs. Bioletti,
word-of-mouth publicity about the
importance of contraceptives is the best
kind of publicity the clinic can get.
She remembers a Mexican woman
who came into the San Jose clinic
almost in tears and said to a staff
member, "I just learned today that I
don't have to have a seventh baby."
Little or no work has been done with
the Fast Palo Alto community. Though
some women do come to the clinic from
that area, there is a city-government
supported clinic in the community that
does dispense pills.
PA Clinic Inactive
The Palo Alto Clinic has done no
active prosletizing in East Palo Alto
"because of the touchy political
situation involved," Mrs. Miller said. She

is referring here to the much-reported
reaction against birth control by some
black power advocates. This point of
view sees bith control as a form of white
racism and racial genocide.
Faced with a small budget and a large
number of perspective clients, Mrs.
Bioletti says that the clinic is hoping for
what she calls a "snowball effect." More
and more people will hopefully hear
about the clinic and contribute time and
money to it. Through this process, the
clinic will become "an on-going
concern" that more individuals will
come to respect.
Mrs. Bioletti shook h?r head. "It may
seem perfectly obvious to us." she said.
