# SRI

We have heard pious statements that the
SRI question is very eomplex. We have all
seen a complicated, 52-page report that
emphasizes how difficult it will be to
decide what to do with SRI.
Actually, our choices on SRI are very
simple. SRl's financial problems and net
worth are interesting, but they are not
relevant to the decision we must make.
What we do need to understand is
ourselves. We must know whether we are
responsible for our own actions, the actions
of Stanford University, and the actions of
our nation.
SRI does research which we have all
agreed is intolerable-CBW,
counterinsurgency, and secret research. The
student body condemned such research
yesterday by an overwhelming vote. The
faculty has shown substantial agreement.
Dr. Pitzer has added his voice, eloquently.
If we as a community believe that such
research is evil, - we must do everything in
our power to end it—at Stanford, at SRI,
and throughout the world. It is in our
power to stop such research at SRI as long
as our University owns SRI. We must
inform our Trustees that it is our wish that
they retain and control SRI.
Just as we are united against research to
make war, so are we united in favor of
humane research—to counter the ecological

poison and social turmoil which threaten
the survival of mankind. If we believe such
research should be encouraged, then we
must act on our conviction. We can redirect
SRI from d<;ath research to life research.
But only if we retain control.
We have heard arguments that we should
sell SRI to make a lot of money for the
University-535 million, in fact. We have
even been told that we can have our cake
and eat it too-by imposing a covenant on
the sale. Such a covenant would supposedly
prohibit CBW and counterinsurgency at
SRI.
The covenant idea is full of holes. Once
signed, the covenant can never be improved
or enlarged. And it is doubtful that a court
would enforce it. Sale with covenant
eliminates the hope of redirecting SRI to
socially desirable research.
SRI must be retained. In the next week,
we will have many opportunities to express
our wish. Unless we speak .forcefully, the
trustees may agree with those who are
urging them to sell SRI. If SRI is sold, the
consequences will be tragic for this
campus-and the world.
