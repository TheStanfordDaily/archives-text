## University Makes SRI Prostitute Self 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
In the events of the last few
days, it has become clear to most
of us at SRI that, even
discounting emotionalism, the
factual basis for a choice of
alternatives as to the future
relationship of our two
organizations is widely
misunderstood on the campus.
Economically, SRI as a
non-profit organization is barely
able to survive as things are, and it
is absurd to imagine that it could
suddenly find the additional
revenue to "buy itself from
Stanford" at the rate of more than
a million a year. The imposition
of moral standards from without,
by faculty or student fiat, would
also effectively put the
organization out of business, both
because no self-respecting research
worker will accept such
humiliation, and because few
clients, government or otherwise,
would do business with us under
such conditions. The factually
available alternatives left are two:
liquidation of SRI
completely—and to liquidate it
completely would consume all the
available assets, in termination
pay to employees and in liabiliites
for unfulfilled contracts of all

sorts—or complete severance of all
ties with the University. Since the
events of the last few days and the
Scott report, exposing the
arrogance, greed and prejudice so
prevalent among the community
of scholars, maintenance of the
existing relationship is hardly
feasible.
As Bauer and Cleaver, at least,
have had the sense to admit, one
of the prinicpal reasons SRI has
been unable to devote more of its
efforts to open research in the
public interest has been our
acceptance of major limitations
on the right originally
comtemplated in our Articles of
Incorporation, to seek gifts and
endowment. This limitation was
accepted at the request of the
University—and it must be
removed if the Institute is truly to
fulfill its intended goals for the
welfare of our communities and
of mankind. SRI has been forced
into prostitution by these
limitations, and by pressure for
contributions to the University in
many forms, open and concealed.
The University has profited from
this prostitution. Let it now make
amends for its sins, and abandon
its smug and hypocritical attitude
of moral superiority.

Give us at SRI the economic
freedom, and we will be able to
apply the moral standards
ourselves.

An Open Letter to ASSU
President Hayes:
Your self-righteous concern for
"maladroit blundering" on the
part of Governor Reagan is indeed
an awesome thing to behold,
especially when viewed in the
light of the state of affairs of
"your administration" here at
Stanford. May I remind you that
you were elected to your grand
office by only a very small part of
the Stanford community?
It is in keeping with the
guarantee of the freedom of
speech that you can shoot your
mouth off when you so please.
However, in the future, will you
refrain from supposing to
represent the entire Stanford
community? You sure as hell
don't represent me in any way; I
hope that you don't represent a

very large part of Stanford
University. TRENT R.LOGAN

Editor, THE DAILY:
Much of the discussion at the
open meeting of the Committee
on Research Policy turned on
allegations that the Committee
has abused its charter so as to
soften the outlines in the picture
of military research activity on
the campus. Certainly a cursory
comparison of the descriptions in
the Committee's report with the
more detailed information
recently circulated by students
tends to support the accusations
made at that meeting.
The various proposals that
were made for reform of
committee procedures seem to
this writer to have missed the
point. In fact, there is no way the
Committee could have functioned
other than to conceal the real
nature of the classified work by
directing public attention to
those features that happen also to
have non-military value. The
Committee members have

deceived themselves if they
believe, as their Foreward
suggests, that they were informing
the faculty and students what was
being done on classified projects.
They are in fact forbidden by law
to do just that.
The purpose of classification is
precisely to prevent information
from becoming public knowledge.
So long as secret activity is
tolerated, there is no way to
prevent a counter-insurgency
project from being entitled "A
Study of Flora Indigenous to the
Inner Quad" and being described
in correspondingly glowing colors
by a Watchdog Committee whose
members may or may not know
what is actually happening.
It seems to me that if the
present issue is to be faced
realistically, then ultimately it will
have to be faced in these terms.

Much of the discussion at the
open meeting of the Committee
on Research Policy turned on
allegations that the Committee
has abused its charter so as to
soften the outlines in the picture
of military research activity on
the campus. Certainly a cursory
comparison of the descriptions in
the Committee's report with the
more detailed information
recently circulated by students
tends to support the accusations
made at that meeting.
The various proposals that
were made for reform of
committee procedures seem to
this writer to have missed the
point. In fact, there is no way the
Committee could have functioned
other than to conceal the real
nature of the classified work by
directing public attention to
those features that happen also to
have non-military value. The
Committee members have

deceived themselves if they
believe, as their Foreward
suggests, that they were informing
the faculty and students what was
being done on classified projects.
They are in fact forbidden by law
to do just that.
The purpose of classification is
precisely to prevent information
from becoming public knowledge.
So long as secret activity is
tolerated, there is no way to
prevent a counter-insurgency
project from being entitled "A
Study of Flora Indigenous to the
Inner Quad" and being described
in correspondingly glowing colors
by a Watchdog Committee whose
members may or may not know
what is actually happening.
It seems to me that if the
present issue is to be faced
realistically, then ultimately it will
have to be faced in these terms.

In the events of the last few
days, it has become clear to most
of us at SRI that, even
discounting emotionalism, the
factual basis for a choice of
alternatives as to the future
relationship of our two
organizations is widely
misunderstood on the campus.
Economically, SRI as a
non-profit organization is barely
able to survive as things are, and it
is absurd to imagine that it could
suddenly find the additional
revenue to "buy itself from
Stanford" at the rate of more than
a million a year. The imposition
of moral standards from without,
by faculty or student fiat, would
also effectively put the
organization out of business, both
because no self-respecting research
worker will accept such
humiliation, and because few
clients, government or otherwise,
would do business with us under
such conditions. The factually
available alternatives left are two:
liquidation of SRI
completely—and to liquidate it
completely would consume all the
available assets, in termination
pay to employees and in liabiliites
for unfulfilled contracts of all

sorts—or complete severance of all
ties with the University. Since the
events of the last few days and the
Scott report, exposing the
arrogance, greed and prejudice so
prevalent among the community
of scholars, maintenance of the
existing relationship is hardly
feasible.
As Bauer and Cleaver, at least,
have had the sense to admit, one
of the prinicpal reasons SRI has
been unable to devote more of its
efforts to open research in the
public interest has been our
acceptance of major limitations
on the right originally
comtemplated in our Articles of
Incorporation, to seek gifts and
endowment. This limitation was
accepted at the request of the
University—and it must be
removed if the Institute is truly to
fulfill its intended goals for the
welfare of our communities and
of mankind. SRI has been forced
into prostitution by these
limitations, and by pressure for
contributions to the University in
many forms, open and concealed.
The University has profited from
this prostitution. Let it now make
amends for its sins, and abandon
its smug and hypocritical attitude
of moral superiority.

Give us at SRI the economic
freedom, and we will be able to
apply the moral standards
ourselves.

pay to employees and in liabiliites
for unfulfilled contracts of all

sorts—or complete severance of all
ties with the University. Since the
events of the last few days and the
Scott report, exposing the
arrogance, greed and prejudice so
prevalent among the community
of scholars, maintenance of the
existing relationship is hardly
feasible.
As Bauer and Cleaver, at least,
have had the sense to admit, one
of the prinicpal reasons SRI has
been unable to devote more of its
efforts to open research in the
public interest has been our
acceptance of major limitations
on the right originally
comtemplated in our Articles of
Incorporation, to seek gifts and
endowment. This limitation was
accepted at the request of the
University—and it must be
removed if the Institute is truly to
fulfill its intended goals for the
welfare of our communities and
of mankind. SRI has been forced
into prostitution by these
limitations, and by pressure for
contributions to the University in
many forms, open and concealed.
The University has profited from
this prostitution. Let it now make
amends for its sins, and abandon
its smug and hypocritical attitude
of moral superiority.

Give us at SRI the economic
freedom, and we will be able to
apply the moral standards
ourselves.

An Open Letter to ASSU
President Hayes:
Your self-righteous concern for
"maladroit blundering" on the
part of Governor Reagan is indeed
an awesome thing to behold,
especially when viewed in the
light of the state of affairs of
"your administration" here at
Stanford. May I remind you that
you were elected to your grand
office by only a very small part of
the Stanford community?
It is in keeping with the
guarantee of the freedom of
speech that you can shoot your
mouth off when you so please.
However, in the future, will you
refrain from supposing to
represent the entire Stanford
community? You sure as hell
don't represent me in any way; I
hope that you don't represent a

very large part of Stanford
University. TRENT R.LOGAN

•On Classifiration
. . . , ,
Editor, THE DAILY:
Much of the discussion at the
open meeting of the Committee
on Research Policy turned on
allegations that the Committee
has abused its charter so as to
soften the outlines in the picture
of military research activity on
the campus. Certainly a cursory
comparison of the descriptions in
the Committee's report with the
more detailed information
recently circulated by students
tends to support the accusations
made at that meeting.
The various proposals that
were made for reform of
committee procedures seem to
this writer to have missed the
point. In fact, there is no way the
Committee could have functioned
other than to conceal the real
nature of the classified work by
directing public attention to
those features that happen also to
have non-military value. The
Committee members have

deceived themselves if they
believe, as their Foreward
suggests, that they were informing
the faculty and students what was
being done on classified projects.
They are in fact forbidden by law
to do just that.
The purpose of classification is
precisely to prevent information
from becoming public knowledge.
So long as secret activity is
tolerated, there is no way to
prevent a counter-insurgency
project from being entitled "A
Study of Flora Indigenous to the
Inner Quad" and being described
in correspondingly glowing colors
by a Watchdog Committee whose
members may or may not know
what is actually happening.
It seems to me that if the
present issue is to be faced
realistically, then ultimately it will
have to be faced in these terms.
