## Left Lacks Faith In Common Student 
### Denis Hayes 
There are few things more
patently absurd than the New
Left approach to decision-making.
The method of making choices
lacks any consistent
methodological base: it simply
adapts itself to changing
circumstances by mutating to
whatever form seems most likely
to produce the "correct"
decisions.
Although "participatory
democracy" is beginning to pale
as a pragmatic societal goal, it is
nonetheless still sacrosanct during
all radical demonstrations.
Decisions thus made are
unchallengeable, because they are
"democratically" arrived at.
But this democracy is only
selectively valid.
According to the New Left, a
referendum of the community or
a questionnaire mailed to every
student, and faculty member at
Stanford is not "democratic"; a
majority decision by those
responding has no binding
validity. However a majority vote
among 5% of the community who
attend a Wednesday rally at
Dinklespiel is "democracy," and a
majority vote is the penultimate
of legitimacy.
A person who deeply shares
the announced end goals of a New
Left movement is not allowed to
vote on a tactic unless he is willing
to abide by a majority decision. A
person who wants to end
classified research on campus
cannot vote against sitting-in as a
tactic unless he is personally
willing to sit-in if he fails.
And a person who feels that

violence would be
counterproductive, or that
violence is against the dictates of
his own conscience, is unable to
vote against an escalation to
violence unless he is willing to be
violent if he loses.
Can't Decide Tactics
As a result, a deeply
committed person cannot help
make a tactical decision about a
movement he cares deeply about
without running the risk of having
to be counterproductive or
immoral if he happens to be in a
minority.
Furthermore, those righteous
individuals who are taking part in
a sit-in have a right to refuse a
majority decision of their fellow
sitters-in to leave, unless the vote
is overwhelmingly against
staying—say 70 to 80%. This is
because those who have taken this
action have committed themselves
and taken a risk and thus deserve
a latitude in determining their
individual future actions.
And finally, whenever
everything else fails, an isolated
radical action can be
justified—regardless of any kind of
vote —because "democracy is
bullshit." That is true because the
U.S. has only 6% of the world's
population and has more than
60% of the world's wealth.
U.S. Coercive Minority
The U.S. is thus a coercive
minority in the world, and
therefore a coercive minority
within the U.S. can claim
solidarity with the oppressed
majority in the third
world — making local or even

national democracy "bullshit."
"Why don't you let the
Vietnamese vote?"
The final result of all this,
obviously, is that it is damned
near impossible for a leftist
movement to make a non-radical
decision. It is a tremendous
compliment to the group
intelligence of the Coalition that
the AEL sit-in did not escalate.
The odds were heavily stacked
against such moderate restraint.
Almost all the people who
participated in the voting of the
April 3 Movement stood fast by
its rules. They voted only if they
were willing to stand by the
consequences of the group vote. It
is therefore distressing that a
number of members of the April 3
Movement were not willing to
abide by the idiosycracies of
another group of voters—the
Stanford student body.
Only Students Vote
Last Friday I called a meeting
of the entire student body in
Frost Ampitheater. It was
attended by a crowd in excess of
8000 persons.
Students who could present
their student body cards were
given a questionnaire on which to
record their opinions. This was
then to constitute an informal
poll of interested members of the
Associated Students.
There were many people in the
Frost audience who were not
members of the Associated
Students. There were some
faculty, some high school
students, some students from
other campuses, some ex-students,

and some employees. Provisions
were made to allow this mass
amalgum to express its opinion on
any issue by a standing vote. Only
students, however, were to be
given the questionnaire.
Radicals Grab Ballots
A small group of radicals
decided this was not "the right
way "—although the method was
approved in a standing vote by
more than 80% of all the people
in Frost. So the righteous covey
of radicals assaulted two students
who were handing out ballots and
absconded with a small number of
ballots. They also intimidated the
students into giving out ballots to
a few people in line without
checking their identifications.
The result was awfully ironic.
The voting pattern was so heavily
patterned in the direction which
the April 3 Coalition would favor
that the small number of disputed
ballots is without real significance.
Yet there is no way of knowing
exactly how many ballots fell to
non-students. So now the public
press can use the radical
ballot-stealing to challenge the
validity of the entire poll.
As I've been saying for the past
year, the biggest flaw in the
Stanford Left is that it doesn't
have sufficient faith in the
instincts of the common student.
It has yet to learn that wise
decisions can be arrived at
without manipulation.
