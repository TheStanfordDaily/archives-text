# Guided Tour
## Students March On SRI 
### 
The April 3 Movement conducted a
guided tour of Stanford's Industrial
Park yesterday on its way to the
Hanover Street facility of the Stanford
Research Institute.
The march followed a noon rally in
White Plaza, and was part of the
continued protest by the April 3
Movement of military contracts
performed by Stanford and its affiliate,
the Stanford Research Institute.
More than 80 students made the
march to the facility which is located at
2690 Hanover Street in the Industrial
Park.
According to speakers the rally was
chosen because they said it houses most
of the counter-insurgency work done by
SRI.
The facility houses the Regional
Securities Study Center of which a
counterpart is located in Bangkok,
Thailand.
President Pitzer and Provost Richard
Lyman have encouraged instructors to
cancel classes today and allow students
to attend panel discussions planned.
March Route
The march was routed through the
campus and proceeded to Hanover
Street via Escondido road until reaching
Page Mill Road.
The march picked up people along
the route from Wilbur and Branner
houses. A contingent from Florence
Moore Hall also joined later on.
As they proceeded, details of the
various corporations in the park were
given mostly by Peter Dollinger a
former grad student at Stanford and
Leonard Siegal of Students for a
Democratic Society.
Marchers passed Utah Minning and
Construction Company,
Hewlett-Packard, Lockheed, and
Watkins Johnson among others.

Marchers were greeted at the
Hanover facility by Homer Meaders
public relations man for SRI. Security
guards were seen and according to Fred
Cohen the marchers were prevented
contact with employees.
No attempt was made to enter the
building.
The march was part of the
continuing process of educational
campaign planned by the April 3
Movement.
During the day movement
representatives entered classrooms to
explain the Stanford-SRI situation to
students. Particular emphasis was placed
on members of the Academic Senate
who are meeting today at 3:15 in the
Stanford Graduate School of Business.
They will be discussing the Scott
committee report at that time.
Panels Planned
Today various panels have been
planned as part of the"Day of
Concern" (for details see schedule).
The Graduate School of Business
announced they will have panel
discussions on Wednesday and Thursday
noon in Bishop Auditorium. Topics will

be SRI and University Research Policies.
Tentatively speakers on the
Wednesday panel will be Doron
Weinberg, Nick Falk and Charles
Anderson, President of SRI.
On Thursday Prof. Baxter and Mike
Sweeney are tentative speakers. Both
meetings will be moderated by Professor
Bach of the Business School.
