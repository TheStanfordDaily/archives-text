The time is not long past when the
Stanford student body president organized
picnics at Lake Lagunita.
The difference between such outings
and the meeting in Frost Amphitheater last
Friday dramatically illustrates the changed
function of the elected student leader at
Stanford. He no longer labors endlessly
about appropriations to clubs or trys to
arrange discussions that no one attends.
More than 8000 people came to a
meeting arranged by Denis Hayes because it
dealt with deadly serious issues. Quite apart
from its meaning as a venture in
community discussion, the Frost gathering
indicated that student government here is
dealing with live questions and involving
massive numbers within its framework.
Denis Hayes did much to give student
government an important place at
Stanford. He did it at personal sacrifice,
but proved that dynamic thinking and
energy in the structures of ASSU can
provide a crucial voice for student
concerns.
Tomorrow and Thursday, students go to

the polls to elect a new president. They will
be electing a spokesman who, for better or
for worse, will represent them in the
internal decision-making of the Stanford
administration and faculty.
The president must be articulate and
knowledgeable in the ways of pushing
faculty, administration and trustees toward
decisions they think outrageous. He must
be strong willed and familiar with the
complex and often emotional issues that
swirl about Stanford today. He must be
able to relate to a trustee yet have the
strength to tell a businessman that the ideas
of Wall Street cannot and must not rule a
University.
Most important, the ASSU president
must be where the action is and share the
desires, loves, and fears that move students
to challenge the hollow values that support
ghettos and build war machines.
Pat Shea and his three running mates
have these qualities. The election must
support concern and understanding, not
flash and smoothness.
