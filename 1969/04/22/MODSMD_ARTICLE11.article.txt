# The 						Legal Angle
## On Restrictive Covenant 
### Henry Killeen Doron Weinberg 
The report of the Stanford-SRI
Study Committee suggests three
alternative dispositions which
might satisfy current objections
about the existing relationship
between the University and its
research institute. To those who
favor continuing control of the
nature of research undertaken at
SRI, the report offers two
choices: control by the University
or sale with restrictive covenant to
an outside party.
Since a clear majority of the
Study Committee, and a
considerable segment of the
University community, have
stated themselves to be in favor of
continuing control, it is important
that we consider the implications
of the two suggested forms of
control. For this purpose, we shall
consider the legal and practical
difficulties inherent in the idea of
sale with a restrictive covenant,
difficulties which we think
indicate that option to be
unrealistic.
A covenant prohibiting
specific types of research, like
that suggested in the Study
Committee's Majority Report,
meets some obvious legal

roadblocks. First, since the law
will not enforce indefinite
restrictions of this kind, a time
limit would have to be set after
which the restriction would
disappear and the research could
begin again. This objection would
apparently apply to any
attempted control through a sale,
and we think it is incompatible
with a serious attempt to stop the
research.
Drafting the covenant presents
other Serious problems. The
statment of objectionable areas of
research in such a way as to
permit enforcement in court
requires precise definition. Such
precision would be likely to result
in narrow, closed-ended categories
and preclude control of
objectionable types of research
which might arise later.
Moreover, reliance on
restrictive covenants fails to meet
SRl's critics' objections
adequately. The present
organization of SRI derives 46%
of its income from the
Department of Defense, and the
needs which it survives by filling
are incompatible with the posed
restrictions. Restrictions basically

attempt to control the results of
this funding by imposing artificial
constraints on its use. They do
not alter SRl's dependence on this
income.
The practical result is that SRI
is crippled in its operation while
the continued importance of the
Department of Defense may still
lead to research that is
objectionable on the principles
underlying the restrictions but
technically acceptable under their
formulations. This solution should
satisfy no one, since it would
cripple the Institute financially
(lowering its sale value) without
really satisying the purposes of
the Institute's critics.
The Majority Report, in its
attempt to separate "moral" from
"organizational" questions, fails
to recognize this point. In order
to meet the objections of the
critics, the Institute would have to
be either re-organized to serve
different interests or crippled by
legal restraints on a large amount
of its present business. If the
re-organization approach were
chosen sale would probably be
impractical, since the
r e - or ganization would be

time-consuming and the Institute
would lose most of its value to
potential buyers.
Beyond these difficulties in
definition and the elimination of
any possibility for future
re-orientation, the idea of sale
with restrictive covenant
necessitates a Commitment to
cumbersome forms of
enforcement. It would be
necessary to write into the
contract provisions for an
enforcing body which would
fairly represent the desires which
the university community signaled
in drafting the original covenant.
Even if it were assumed that
the Board of Trustees need not be
the enforcing body, the question
still arises whether the group
would continue to be responsive
to the community's needs rather
than becoming, as some university
committees have, a merely ritual
body.
If it were to carefully apply the
guidelines, on the other hand, the
group would then be required to
institute long and costly legal
proceedings over each and every
potential infringement of the
covenant since even a purchaser
attempting to live up to the terms
of the agreement may disagree
over the meaning of terms. Such a
problem would not exist if SRI
were retained since these
controversies would be settled
internally without resort to the
courts.
Finally, it should be noted that
there is an inherent paradox in the
suggestion of sale with a
restrictive covenant. The
advocates of such sale have based
their arguments to a large extent
on the financial difficulties which
the University might face if it
retained SRI under new research
guidelines. They suggest that
elimination of certain types of
research would necessarily
generate a financial deficit in
SRl's yearly budget which the
University would have to
subsidize. But if such a deficit is
in fact inevitable, why should it
be supposed that an outside buyer
would agree to subsidize it
instead?
Clearly, a buyer in salt with
restrictive covenant would be
motivated by one of two
considerations: either a belief that
the covenant would not restrain
him from continuing in the
prohibited research because it
could not be enforced, or a belief
that new and unobjectionable
types of research might be
developed to substitute for those
eliminated. If it is the former then
the advocates of a restrictive
covenant could hardly be
satisfied, while if it is the latter
then it is quite reasonable to
suppose that the University could
itself develop such new outlets.
Given the negative orientation
of restrictive covenants, the more
weight given to critics' demands
the more damage done to SRI.
Seen in this light a positive
attempt to control and redirect
SRl's activity is to us a more
attractive proposal.

elimination of certain types of
research would necessarily
generate a financial deficit in
SRl's yearly budget which the
University would have to
subsidize. But if such a deficit is
in fact inevitable, why should it
be supposed that an outside buyer
would agree to subsidize it
instead?
Clearly, a buyer in salt with
restrictive covenant would be
motivated by one of two
considerations: either a belief that
the covenant would not restrain
him from continuing in the
prohibited research because it
could not be enforced, or a belief
that new and unobjectionable
types of research might be
developed to substitute for those
eliminated. If it is the former then
the advocates of a restrictive
covenant could hardly be
satisfied, while if it is the latter
then it is quite reasonable to
suppose that the University could
itself develop such new outlets.
Given the negative orientation
of restrictive covenants, the more
weight given to critics' demands
the more damage done to SRI.
Seen in this light a positive
attempt to control and redirect
SRl's activity is to us a more
attractive proposal.

The report of the Stanford-SRI
Study Committee suggests three
alternative dispositions which
might satisfy current objections
about the existing relationship
between the University and its
research institute. To those who
favor continuing control of the
nature of research undertaken at
SRI, the report offers two
choices: control by the University
or sale with restrictive covenant to
an outside party.
Since a clear majority of the
Study Committee, and a
considerable segment of the
University community, have
stated themselves to be in favor of
continuing control, it is important
that we consider the implications
of the two suggested forms of
control. For this purpose, we shall
consider the legal and practical
difficulties inherent in the idea of
sale with a restrictive covenant,
difficulties which we think
indicate that option to be
unrealistic.
A covenant prohibiting
specific types of research, like
that suggested in the Study
Committee's Majority Report,
meets some obvious legal

roadblocks. First, since the law
will not enforce indefinite
restrictions of this kind, a time
limit would have to be set after
which the restriction would
disappear and the research could
begin again. This objection would
apparently apply to any
attempted control through a sale,
and we think it is incompatible
with a serious attempt to stop the
research.
Drafting the covenant presents
other Serious problems. The
statment of objectionable areas of
research in such a way as to
permit enforcement in court
requires precise definition. Such
precision would be likely to result
in narrow, closed-ended categories
and preclude control of
objectionable types of research
which might arise later.
Moreover, reliance on
restrictive covenants fails to meet
SRl's critics' objections
adequately. The present
organization of SRI derives 46%
of its income from the
Department of Defense, and the
needs which it survives by filling
are incompatible with the posed
restrictions. Restrictions basically

attempt to control the results of
this funding by imposing artificial
constraints on its use. They do
not alter SRl's dependence on this
income.
The practical result is that SRI
is crippled in its operation while
the continued importance of the
Department of Defense may still
lead to research that is
objectionable on the principles
underlying the restrictions but
technically acceptable under their
formulations. This solution should
satisfy no one, since it would
cripple the Institute financially
(lowering its sale value) without
really satisying the purposes of
the Institute's critics.
The Majority Report, in its
attempt to separate "moral" from
"organizational" questions, fails
to recognize this point. In order
to meet the objections of the
critics, the Institute would have to
be either re-organized to serve
different interests or crippled by
legal restraints on a large amount
of its present business. If the
re-organization approach were
chosen sale would probably be
impractical, since the
r e - or ganization would be

time-consuming and the Institute
would lose most of its value to
potential buyers.
Beyond these difficulties in
definition and the elimination of
any possibility for future
re-orientation, the idea of sale
with restrictive covenant
necessitates a Commitment to
cumbersome forms of
enforcement. It would be
necessary to write into the
contract provisions for an
enforcing body which would
fairly represent the desires which
the university community signaled
in drafting the original covenant.
Even if it were assumed that
the Board of Trustees need not be
the enforcing body, the question
still arises whether the group
would continue to be responsive
to the community's needs rather
than becoming, as some university
committees have, a merely ritual
body.
If it were to carefully apply the
guidelines, on the other hand, the
group would then be required to
institute long and costly legal
proceedings over each and every
potential infringement of the
covenant since even a purchaser
attempting to live up to the terms
of the agreement may disagree
over the meaning of terms. Such a
problem would not exist if SRI
were retained since these
controversies would be settled
internally without resort to the
courts.
Finally, it should be noted that
there is an inherent paradox in the
suggestion of sale with a
restrictive covenant. The
advocates of such sale have based
their arguments to a large extent
on the financial difficulties which
the University might face if it
retained SRI under new research
guidelines. They suggest that
elimination of certain types of
research would necessarily
generate a financial deficit in

necessary to write into the
contract provisions for an
enforcing body which would
fairly represent the desires which
the university community signaled
in drafting the original covenant.
Even if it were assumed that
the Board of Trustees need not be
the enforcing body, the question
still arises whether the group
would continue to be responsive
to the community's needs rather
than becoming, as some university
committees have, a merely ritual
body.
If it were to carefully apply the
guidelines, on the other hand, the
group would then be required to
institute long and costly legal
proceedings over each and every
potential infringement of the
covenant since even a purchaser
attempting to live up to the terms
of the agreement may disagree
over the meaning of terms. Such a
problem would not exist if SRI
were retained since these
controversies would be settled
internally without resort to the
courts.
Finally, it should be noted that
there is an inherent paradox in the
suggestion of sale with a
restrictive covenant. The
advocates of such sale have based
their arguments to a large extent
on the financial difficulties which
the University might face if it
retained SRI under new research
guidelines. They suggest that
elimination of certain types of
research would necessarily
generate a financial deficit in
SRl's yearly budget which the
University would have to
subsidize. But if such a deficit is
in fact inevitable, why should it
be supposed that an outside buyer
would agree to subsidize it
instead?
Clearly, a buyer in salt with
restrictive covenant would be
motivated by one of two
considerations: either a belief that
the covenant would not restrain
him from continuing in the
prohibited research because it
could not be enforced, or a belief
that new and unobjectionable
types of research might be
developed to substitute for those
eliminated. If it is the former then
the advocates of a restrictive
covenant could hardly be
satisfied, while if it is the latter
then it is quite reasonable to
suppose that the University could
itself develop such new outlets.
Given the negative orientation
of restrictive covenants, the more
weight given to critics' demands
the more damage done to SRI.
Seen in this light a positive
attempt to control and redirect
SRl's activity is to us a more
attractive proposal.

The report of the Stanford-SRI
Study Committee suggests three
alternative dispositions which
might satisfy current objections
about the existing relationship
between the University and its
research institute. To those who
favor continuing control of the
nature of research undertaken at
SRI, the report offers two
choices: control by the University
or sale with restrictive covenant to
an outside party.
Since a clear majority of the
Study Committee, and a
considerable segment of the
University community, have
stated themselves to be in favor of
continuing control, it is important
that we consider the implications
of the two suggested forms of
control. For this purpose, we shall
consider the legal and practical
difficulties inherent in the idea of
sale with a restrictive covenant,
difficulties which we think
indicate that option to be
unrealistic.
A covenant prohibiting
specific types of research, like
that suggested in the Study
Committee's Majority Report,
meets some obvious legal

roadblocks. First, since the law
will not enforce indefinite
restrictions of this kind, a time
limit would have to be set after
which the restriction would
disappear and the research could
begin again. This objection would
apparently apply to any
attempted control through a sale,
and we think it is incompatible
with a serious attempt to stop the
research.
Drafting the covenant presents
other Serious problems. The
statment of objectionable areas of
research in such a way as to
permit enforcement in court
requires precise definition. Such
precision would be likely to result
in narrow, closed-ended categories
and preclude control of
objectionable types of research
which might arise later.
Moreover, reliance on
restrictive covenants fails to meet
SRl's critics' objections
adequately. The present
organization of SRI derives 46%
of its income from the
Department of Defense, and the
needs which it survives by filling
are incompatible with the posed
restrictions. Restrictions basically

attempt to control the results of
this funding by imposing artificial
constraints on its use. They do
not alter SRl's dependence on this
income.
The practical result is that SRI
is crippled in its operation while
the continued importance of the
Department of Defense may still
lead to research that is
objectionable on the principles
underlying the restrictions but
technically acceptable under their
formulations. This solution should
satisfy no one, since it would
cripple the Institute financially
(lowering its sale value) without
really satisying the purposes of
the Institute's critics.
The Majority Report, in its
attempt to separate "moral" from
"organizational" questions, fails
to recognize this point. In order
to meet the objections of the
critics, the Institute would have to
be either re-organized to serve
different interests or crippled by
legal restraints on a large amount
of its present business. If the
re-organization approach were
chosen sale would probably be
impractical, since the
r e - or ganization would be

time-consuming and the Institute
would lose most of its value to
potential buyers.
Beyond these difficulties in
definition and the elimination of
any possibility for future
re-orientation, the idea of sale
with restrictive covenant
necessitates a Commitment to
cumbersome forms of
enforcement. It would be
necessary to write into the
contract provisions for an
enforcing body which would
fairly represent the desires which
the university community signaled
in drafting the original covenant.
