# Art, Social Change Weekly Lecture Topic
## 
### 
James M. Woods, President of
Studio Watts School for the Arts,
will speak on "Art As the Tool for
Social Change" in the Auditorium
of the Nathan Cummings Art
Building.
The lecture is part of the
Wednesday Lectures in Art series
sponsored by the Committee for

Art at Stanford.
Woods and several of the
Studio apprentices will be at
Stanford from Wednesday
through Friday as
guests-in-residence of Serra House
and Fraternity Cluster 3. In the
past year groups from the Studio
have visited Stanford twice,

presenting productions of NO
EXIT and BLACK GIRL IN
SEARCH OF GOD.
Following Wednesday evening's
lecture there will be an open,
informal reception for the group
in the Serra House Lounge
sponsored jointly by Tresidder
Union Cultural Arts Division, the
Black Students Union and Serra
House.
Beginning the week of April 21
a new publication, STUDIO
WATTS, will be sold in the Bay
Area. The paper was originally
designed as a newsletter for
Wood's Studio Watts School.
The first issue was so well
accepted by the residents of the
Watts Community that the
concept of the publication was
expanded so that it is no longer
merely a newsletter, although it
has retained the STUDIO WATTS
title.
The publication is a newspaper
presenting uncensored material of
the ghettoes of the United States.
It is edited by a group of
individuals from the citizenry of
Watts and surrounding
communities. Its sole purpose is
to change our environment, and
the way in which we view our
environment, by providing
constructive and artistically
pleasing reading material for, and
written by, low income groups
from the ghettoes.
Subscriptions will be sold for
$2.00/1 year (4 issues). Anyone
interested in subscribing to this
publication should send their
name and address and $2.00 to
"STUDIO WATTS", Box 3963,
Stanford, Calif. 94305.
