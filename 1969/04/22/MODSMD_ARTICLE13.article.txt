## News Service's Role Defended 
### Robert W. Beyers 
The terrible urgency with
which Michael Sweeney felt
results of the Frost Amphitheater
votes should be reported was not
apparent when he visited News
Service Friday, for he made no
mention of this as an upcoming
story.
As a former Daily editor and
an occasional News Service intern,
he also knows that he or any
other individual is free to contact
the news media directly whenever
they have an item of significant
importance to report.
He did not do so until late
Saturday afternoon, nor did he
call me directly to suggest this be
done prior to that time.
The final News Service releases
went in the mails around 8 p.m.
Friday, ending a 15-hour day for
several of our staff members. As it
happens, that mailing made no
mention of a news conference
held earlier in the day by AEL
staff members, primarily because
of the rather extensive coverage
given the temporary suspension of
the sit-in, the Academic Council
resolutions, the Frost rally and a
concurrent program of
engineering students.
Having worked an average of
about 20 hours a day during the
sit-in, I was still a bit groggy when
I received a call from Dr. Len
Herzenberg late Saturday morning
asking if we had put out a story
on the vote. He was particularly
concerned that these results be
mailed to the faculty, to be on
their desks Monday morning.
His call was the first indication
I had that there had been a vote
on possible resumption of a sit-in
or other similar tactics, since 1)1
had not personally covered the
Frost meeting, and 2) the initial
materials sent me by Denis Hayes
made no mention of this topic,
which was added later as the final
ballot question. After initially

suggesting the Campus Report
might be an appropriate means of
conveying this information to the
faculty, I told Dr. Herzenberg I
would check into the facts and
decide whether or not I felt
distribution of a release to all
members of the Academic Council
was warranted.
I then called the Stanford
Daily to obtain the vote results.
Shortly thereafter, I learned of
some alleged irregularities in the
ballot distribution outside Frost.
By the time this information was
carefully checked and confirmed
(and the magnitude of the ballot
loss appeared to be small) it was
late Saturday afternoon—one of
the least likely times of the week
to obtain broad news coverage for
any event, as Sweeney should
know.
In conversation with Marshall
Schwartz of The Daily, who was
in contact with Sweeney, I
suggested the story might obtain
wider coverage if it was called to
the media Sunday afternoon.
Schwartz said Sweeney wanted it
called to the local newspapers,
which he was doing, so I called
the Associated Press, which
subsequently ran the story.
The approximate text of what
I phoned AP was as follows:
"More than 1500 Stanford
students have said they would
participate in another sit-in 'or
similar action of protest' unless
the Board of Trustees responds
favorably to their concerns about
research at the University and
SRI.
"Stanford has more than
11,000 students.
"More than 3,000 ballots were
distributed to students attending a
Frost Amphitheater rally Friday
afternoon, called by Student
Body President Denis Hayes
during the final stages of a
nine-day sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory. Results
were disclosed Saturday (April
19).
"When a group of about 50
students from the sit-in came
toward the Amphitheater, they
took some ballots away from a
student checking identification
there, according to two student
witnesses. Less than 100 ballots
were believed involved.
"Students at the rally voted
3,073 to 203 to commend the
April Third Movement, which led
the sit-in, for 'helping focus the
attention of the campus upon the
nature of the research being
conducted at the University and
SRI.'
"They urged the cessation of
classified research by a 2-1
majority and opposed research in
chemical-biological warfare,
counter-insurgency, and Southeast
Asia by even wider margins.
"In a 2,207 vote, they called
on students and faculty for a
one-day cessation of classes April
23 (my error —the ballot said April
22) to examine the
appropriateness of these kinds of
research. The Senate of the
Academic Council is scheduled to
discuss research policy the
following day (i.e., April 24).
"In a 2630 to 572 vote, they
said it would be in the best
interest of the University for the
trustees to discontinue the kinds
of research specified and to decide
the future relationship of the
University and SRI by no later
than its May 13 meeting.
"When asked if they would
participate in another sit-in,
should the board not positively
respond to these concerns, 1633
said they would and 1438 said
they would not."
To the best of my recollection,
I did not call the additional
paragraph mentioned by Sweeney
to AP, simply in the interest of

brevity. It was written by that
time, however, and was included
in a subsequent written release.
My lead was a figure of "more
than 1500" simply because that
was fully supported by the facts
then available to me. Even if 100
ballots were taken, there had to
be that many people who had
taken that position.
On the basis of the same facts,
it would have been posible to
report a lead that "Stanford
students today narrowly endorsed
the use of further sit-ins, if the
trustees do not respond positively
to their concerns about research,
etc." To have done so would have
been misleading.
It also would have been
possible, using another result, to
say that "By a 2-1 margin,
Stanford students have called for
a day off from classes to discuss
their concerns about university
research." When I asked Hayes
about the meaning of this
particular vote, he mentioned that
Vic von Schlegell was putting
together a program for Tuesday. I
obtained preliminary information
on this from him Sunday
afternoon and waited until 11
p .m. to get more complete
program information.
When that information was
obtained, it was written up as a
separate release and mailed to
Academic Council members with
a release summarizing the Frost
votes. In my judgment, this was in
keeping with the spirit of the
Academic Council's resolutions
following both the pattern of
mailings over the past several days
and the suggestion initially made
by Dr. Herzenberg Saturday.
Copies of both stories were
delivered to the Palo Alto Times
and the local correspondent of the
San Francisco Examiner Sunday
night.
Sweeney told me he was
unhappy with the coverage that
the vote results received Sunday.
In my judgment, this story still
would have obtained better

coverage had it been reported as a
wrap-up of an event "this
weekend"—a practice which is
common in the news media and
well within the standards of
normal journalistic practices.
