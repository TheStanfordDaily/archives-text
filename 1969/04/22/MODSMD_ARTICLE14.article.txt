# Streaking Tribe Plays Huskies
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
After three days of combat
with Beavers, Ducks and Cougars,
Stanford's hungry Indians will get
a chance today to chew up some
Huskies.
Ano if they're really lucky
they might win another ball game.
Phil Keller will face Washington in
the 3:00 game.
What started as a eminently
successful series of games against
Pac-8 teams from the north struck
a slightly sour note late yesterday
afternoon when the Washington
State Cougars, trailing the Tribe
1-0 going into the ninth inning of
the second game of a twin bill,
tied the contest and won it 2-1 in
the eleventh. The affair was
unique not only because the
Indians lost, but also because of
the way they lost it: an error and
a wild pitch led to one run, a two
run homer (by WSU's Dave

Harshman) scored the others.
I -0 Lead
Stanford had taken the 1-0
lead in the second on three
singles, and sophomore Steve
Dunning, had pitched brilliantly
to preserve it. But the error led to
his removal for a pinch-hitter in
the ninth, and Bob Boone became
the loser in the tenth. It was his
first defeat in six decisions.
The first game was more
typical of the way Stanford's been
playing recently. Lefthanded soph
Jim Coate went the seven inning
distance for the Tribe, giving up a
homer and two singles, and facing
only three more than the
minimum number of hitters. His
mates, meanwhile, scored once in
the third and again in the fourth
(when Mike Ewing tripled and
scored on Larry Garlick's bunt).
Final score: Stanford 2, WSU 1.

The three wins over the teams
from Oregon last weekend were
highlighted by consistently fine
pitching and occasionally
sensational defense. Among the
items worth mentioning...
Keller's six-hit, 11 strike-out
shutout of OSU on Friday as
Stanford won 4-0 . . . The
pitching of Boone (gave up three
hits and fanned eight) and Rod

Poteete (six hits and eight k's) in
the 2-1 and 3-0 wins over Oregon
on Saturday.
The first game was won with a
homer by Jack Hodges and a
perfectly executed squeeze bunt
by Chuck Williams. The story of
the second game was defense, as
the sun-drenched gathering was
treated to nearly half a dozen
electrifying plays. Among them: a

pair of spectacular stabs on foul
balls by Mark Marquess and a
ninth inning play by Poteete. With
Oregon two outs away from
defeat, pinch-hitter Gary Nail laid
a near perfect bunt down the
third base line. Charging in,
Poteete bare-handed the ball and
gunned to the stretching
Marquess, nailing Nail by half a
step. A strike out ended the game.
