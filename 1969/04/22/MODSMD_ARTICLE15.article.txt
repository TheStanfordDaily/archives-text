# Track Loss
## Runners Swamped 
### 
The Stanford track team was over-whelmed by defending national
champion USC last Saturday, and though it is hard to uncover any
encouragement in a meet where the Trojans grabbed one-two in every
flat running event, the Tribe was obviously using this meet to prep for
the Big Meet with California two weeks hence, and the Pac-8
championships four weeks away.
Southern Cal won the meet, 111-43.
Despite an injury to javelin record holder Tom Colby, the Cards
came through with the two best tosses of the day behind Lance
Martin's life time best of 222-3. Steve Davis who has shown
remarkable consistancy this year flung the discus 175-11 to record his
second straight convincing victory. Another Indian attempting to
break the Trojan stampede was Jim Kaufmann with his first long jump
victory of the year at 23-5.
Tom Massey also performed creditably getting off a second place
leap in the triple jump and climbing to 6-8 for third in the high jump.
Massey actually had the longest triple jump of the day but took off a
foot behind the board.
Joining Tom at 6-8 in the high jump were Peter Boyce and Dave
Harper, but unfortunately USC's Park Kennedy stole the competition
by clearing 6-10.
The pole vault crew had the unenviable task of facing Olympian
Bob Seagren, but still came off with Clint Ostrander's second, and
Ken Weed's third. But on the track, the Trojans were devastating and
the Tribe was below par. Only the hurdles were close, with Herm
Franklin edging Rick Tipton in the highs, and the surprising Seagren
beating Randy White in the intermediates.
Otherwise, it was all maroon breaking the tapes as either the Card
runners were experimenting in new events or they were just off after
last week's fine effort at UCLA.
Nonetheless, Coach Jordan can be pleased with Rich Faris' life
time best in the 440 at 48.2 though it was only good for third and
Bob Anchondo's first attempt at the half where he hung in for an
encouraging 1:54.1 effort.
Now the Indians have to forget the past and look to Saturday's
encounter with Oregon who last week took USC to the mile relay
before falling. This week they lost to WSU, 89-65. Unlike the Trojans,
the Ducks are beatable as far as the Tribe is concerned. Stanford
should be at top strength with their most efficient point making line
up.
Coach Marshall Clark's frosh squad remained undefeated by
disposing of Hancock and Butte JC's. Mark Haight was outstanding in
winning both hurdle events and anchoring the mile relay to victory.
Bob Coe missed the frosh two-mile record by .3 of a second in
recording a winning 9:07.0. Also Joe Virga continued his steady
inprovement in the shot with a put of 48-7 1 /2.
