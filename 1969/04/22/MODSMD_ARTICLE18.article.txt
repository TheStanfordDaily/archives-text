Angeles area, will speak
informally with interested
members of the Stanford
community today at 4:15 in the
Physics tank.
A member of the newly
formed House Committee on
Science and Astronautics and the
committee on Veterans Affairs,

candidate. In May 1965 he
became one of the first
congressmen to urge a bombing
halt and a policy of
self-determination for Vietnam.
His voting record includes
opposition to an extension of the

dral t and to the 1963 Defense

chances of nuclear war," he said,
"by helping to establish a
psychological climate in which
such war becomes acceptable."
In addition to speaking
consistently against the war and
against the military-industrial
complex, he has been among the
few congressmen to oppose
supplemental appropriation bills
for the Vietnamese war.
