# Academic Senate Meets To Consider SRI Options
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
The Academic Senate meets today to
discuss the report of the Ad Hoc
Committee On SRI. The closed
meeting will convene in room 75 of the
Graduate School of Business at 3:15
p.m.
Commenting on the agenda, Senate
Chairman, Leonard Schiff stated that
the meeting's sole purpose was: "To
review the report and to consider
conclusions on it." He added, "I don't
know if any decisions will be made."
Another Senator, who asked to
remain anonymous, was more specific in
diagnosing the prospects for action. In
outlining the possible directions
proposals might take, he said, "Ttye
most optimistic thing that could be
asked is for the Senate to suggest to the
Trustees that they extend the
moratorium on chemical and biological
warfare research, include new
counterinsurgency contracts within the
extended moratorium, and delay final
decision until the next academic
quarter."

The Senator then described four
other options that might be considered
by the Senate:
No action and adjournment.
Recess for dinner and readjournment
afterwards.
A recommendation to the Trustees
that the moratorium on chemical and
biological warfare research (CBW) be
continued and the final decision on
SRl's status be delayed until Fall
Quarter. In addition a committee would
be appointed for further research.
Passage of a resolution of support for
the Lyman-Scott proposal for sale of
SRI with maximized profit.
"If you think that the Senate knows
where it is going, you don't realize how
it works. The decision is on the edge of
a coin. It depends on how strong the
liberal forces are.
"This is a very complicated issue.
The conservative forces will probably
oppose the dinner recess and
readjournment. But the Senate should
recognize for the first time that this is a
very complex issue that needs time."
Lyman-Scott Proposal
In concluding he disclosed that the
Lyman-Scott sale proposa 1 had a "good
deal of support." But he emphasized,
"The senior researchers at SRI have not
been consulted enough about their
feelings. So probably, the Senate will
not make a decision on whether or not
to sell the institute. One thing is clear,
that is that the committee (Ad Hoc on
SRI) did a very poor job with their
resources."
Most other Senators contacted
questioned the propriety of discussing
proposals prior to the meeting. They
described the purpose of the session as
educative. Kenneth Scott, Associate
Professor of law and author of the SRI
Committee's majority report, said, "The
Senate is informing itself on a matter of
considerable campus concern."
Assistant Professor of History J.
Philip Dawson replied in the same vein.

"Everyone recognizes that this matter is
complicated and we will have to go after
it as diligently and as quickly as
possible."
The "complexities" of the SRI issue
will be explained to the Senate by the
SRI Committee members —all of whom
have been asked to attend this
afternoon's session. The committee will
participate in the proceedings solely as
information "resources."

Lyman-Scott sale proposa 1 had a "good
deal of support." But he emphasized,
"The senior researchers at SRI have not
been consulted enough about their
feelings. So probably, the Senate will
not make a decision on whether or not
to sell the institute. One thing is clear,
that is that the committee (Ad Hoc on
SRI) did a very poor job with their
resources."
Most other Senators contacted
questioned the propriety of discussing
proposals prior to the meeting. They
described the purpose of the session as
educative. Kenneth Scott, Associate
Professor of law and author of the SRI
Committee's majority report, said, "The
Senate is informing itself on a matter of
considerable campus concern."
Assistant Professor of History J.
Philip Dawson replied in the same vein.

"Everyone recognizes that this matter is
complicated and we will have to go after
it as diligently and as quickly as
possible."
The "complexities" of the SRI issue
will be explained to the Senate by the
SRI Committee members —all of whom
have been asked to attend this
afternoon's session. The committee will
participate in the proceedings solely as
information "resources."
The Academic Senate meets today to
discuss the report of the Ad Hoc
Committee On SRI. The closed
meeting will convene in room 75 of the
Graduate School of Business at 3:15
p.m.
Commenting on the agenda, Senate
Chairman, Leonard Schiff stated that
the meeting's sole purpose was: "To
review the report and to consider
conclusions on it." He added, "I don't
know if any decisions will be made."
Another Senator, who asked to
remain anonymous, was more specific in
diagnosing the prospects for action. In
outlining the possible directions
proposals might take, he said, "Ttye
most optimistic thing that could be
asked is for the Senate to suggest to the
Trustees that they extend the
moratorium on chemical and biological
warfare research, include new
counterinsurgency contracts within the
extended moratorium, and delay final
decision until the next academic
quarter."

The Senator then described four
other options that might be considered
by the Senate:
No action and adjournment.
Recess for dinner and readjournment
afterwards.
A recommendation to the Trustees
that the moratorium on chemical and
biological warfare research (CBW) be
continued and the final decision on
SRl's status be delayed until Fall
Quarter. In addition a committee would
be appointed for further research.
Passage of a resolution of support for
the Lyman-Scott proposal for sale of
SRI with maximized profit.
"If you think that the Senate knows
where it is going, you don't realize how
it works. The decision is on the edge of
a coin. It depends on how strong the
liberal forces are.
"This is a very complicated issue.
The conservative forces will probably
oppose the dinner recess and
readjournment. But the Senate should
recognize for the first time that this is a
very complex issue that needs time."
