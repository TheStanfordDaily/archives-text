# Staff Memo
## 
### 
To: A vanished staff
From: The editor
Where have you gone?
Those who once manned the
typewriters have vanished to parts
unknown. Those who remain see endless
vistas of books and needed sleep. We
cannot long survive without support.
A festival of return has therefore
been planned at The Daily tomorrow at
noon for writers, old and new.
Lunch will be served at the editor's
expense.
He prefers to be financially bankrupt
if he can have a staff.
Please come tomorrow.
