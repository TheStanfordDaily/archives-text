# SRI Head Says His Staff Nixes Committee Options
## 
### MARGIE WOLF (First of two articles) 
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
president Charles Anderson yesterday
voiced financial and philosophical
objections to all three alternatives
suggested by the SRI committee
regarding the Institute's future.
Many SRI professionals were insulted
by the committee's failure to weigh
their opinions on the best course for the
Institute, he said. In addition to this
self-determination issue, Anderson
pointed out "our members are just as
jealous of their academic freedom" as is
the University.
Anderson, commenting after a week
of discussion among SRl's 3000
employees, said an overwhelming
percentage of the scientific and
professional staff have said they would
not submit to the restrictions on their
research suggested by the committee
headed by Law Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The majority committee report
recommended sale of SRI under a
covenant prohibiting research in
chemical and biological warfare,
counterinsurgency and on projects
relating directly to "morally offensive
or undesirable" wars.
Scott admitted last night that no
account had been taken of researcher's
reactions to guidelines. He said the
committee had tried to determine the
quantitative effect of prohibiting some
research, but had not considered its
echo in other contract areas.
Researchers have sent between 300
and 500 memorandums to Anderson
concerning the report. All oppose
guidelines imposed from outside SRI, he
said.
Contractors Hesitating
Unrest within the staff is
contributing to uneasiness of

prospective contractors, Anderson said.
Although contracts are arranged with
SRI rather than with individual
researchers, firms are hesitating until the
situation stabilizes, he said.
One SRI employee in engineering
commented in a written statement,
"The fact is, we are guilty of doing the
research that outrages the moral sense
of the students. Our own guilt feelings
have contributed heavily to the
atmosphere of panic around here during
the past week, and those feelings also
explain the extreme emotions not only
in those of us who want severance but
in those of us who do not." The Daily
will offer more employees' reactions in
an article tomorrow.
Financial Dilemma
Anderson predicted financial
dilemmas under any of the report's
alternatives.

If SRI "bought itself" from the
university, as suggested in the majority
report, it would have to sustain cash
deficits of $1.7 to $3 million a year, he
said.
Anderson also maintained no one
else would be interested in buying SRI
unless it had no restrictive covenant and
could be run for profit. This challenged
the Lyman-Scott sale for profit
minority alternative.
Scott said SRI could be sold, even
under the broadest covenant.
Rudolf Brunsvold, SRI executive
vice-president, stated it would "be bad
to say we can't support the US effort
somewhere in the world." Government
agencies and private firms might not
deal with a company taking such a
stance, he said.
Homer Meadors, director of public
relations, termed the committee's
recommendations "open-ended." He
asked, "How can you do business when
6 months Irom now the contract may
be judged objectionable?"
"I don't see how any responsible
person who knows the facts —including
me—could accept responsibility to a
board of directors for running the
Institute under the restrictive
covenant," Anderson said.
"SRI and Stanford are sister
organizations with a common boss,"
Brunsvold said.
Anderson emphasized, "But we are
not the campus!"
Continuing in this vein, Anderson
noted his responsibility to clients to
maintain the integrity of SRI property
against disruption.
He also explained he had created a
committee to develop plans for a group
of the professional staff from within
SRI to advise him on policy matters.
Their study may be completed and
implemented in a few months.

university, as suggested in the majority
report, it would have to sustain cash
deficits of $1.7 to $3 million a year, he
said.
Anderson also maintained no one
else would be interested in buying SRI
unless it had no restrictive covenant and
could be run for profit. This challenged
the Lyman-Scott sale for profit
minority alternative.
Scott said SRI could be sold, even
under the broadest covenant.
Rudolf Brunsvold, SRI executive
vice-president, stated it would "be bad
to say we can't support the US effort
somewhere in the world." Government
agencies and private firms might not
deal with a company taking such a
stance, he said.
Homer Meadors, director of public
relations, termed the committee's
recommendations "open-ended." He
asked, "How can you do business when
6 months Irom now the contract may
be judged objectionable?"
"I don't see how any responsible
person who knows the facts —including
me—could accept responsibility to a
board of directors for running the
Institute under the restrictive
covenant," Anderson said.
"SRI and Stanford are sister
organizations with a common boss,"
Brunsvold said.
Anderson emphasized, "But we are
not the campus!"
Continuing in this vein, Anderson
noted his responsibility to clients to
maintain the integrity of SRI property
against disruption.
He also explained he had created a
committee to develop plans for a group
of the professional staff from within
SRI to advise him on policy matters.
Their study may be completed and
implemented in a few months.


CHARLES ANDERSON
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
president Charles Anderson yesterday
voiced financial and philosophical
objections to all three alternatives
suggested by the SRI committee
regarding the Institute's future.
Many SRI professionals were insulted
by the committee's failure to weigh
their opinions on the best course for the
Institute, he said. In addition to this
self-determination issue, Anderson
pointed out "our members are just as
jealous of their academic freedom" as is
the University.
Anderson, commenting after a week
of discussion among SRl's 3000
employees, said an overwhelming
percentage of the scientific and
professional staff have said they would
not submit to the restrictions on their
research suggested by the committee
headed by Law Prof. Kenneth E. Scott.
The majority committee report
recommended sale of SRI under a
covenant prohibiting research in
chemical and biological warfare,
counterinsurgency and on projects
relating directly to "morally offensive
or undesirable" wars.
Scott admitted last night that no
account had been taken of researcher's
reactions to guidelines. He said the
committee had tried to determine the
quantitative effect of prohibiting some
research, but had not considered its
echo in other contract areas.
Researchers have sent between 300
and 500 memorandums to Anderson
concerning the report. All oppose
guidelines imposed from outside SRI, he
said.
Contractors Hesitating
Unrest within the staff is
contributing to uneasiness of

prospective contractors, Anderson said.
Although contracts are arranged with
SRI rather than with individual
researchers, firms are hesitating until the
situation stabilizes, he said.
One SRI employee in engineering
commented in a written statement,
"The fact is, we are guilty of doing the
research that outrages the moral sense
of the students. Our own guilt feelings
have contributed heavily to the
atmosphere of panic around here during
the past week, and those feelings also
explain the extreme emotions not only
in those of us who want severance but
in those of us who do not." The Daily
will offer more employees' reactions in
an article tomorrow.
Financial Dilemma
Anderson predicted financial
dilemmas under any of the report's
alternatives.

If SRI "bought itself" from the
university, as suggested in the majority
report, it would have to sustain cash
deficits of $1.7 to $3 million a year, he
said.

else would be interested in buying SRI
