# Princeton Trustees Open Doors To Four Student-Elected Members
## 
### JULIE FEHRING 
The board of trustees at Princeton
University, whose members median age
is currently over 60, announced
yesterday that it will add recent
graduates of the university to its regular
voting body beginning in July.
Voting this May, using a one-man,
one-vote procedure, juniors and seniors
and alumni of the last two graduating

classes will elect, from the senior class,
the first (of ultimately four) special
Â»trustees for a four year term.
Eventually, the 38 member board
will include four young members, all
voted in by their peers.
This is the first time in the history of
an Ivy League institution that the board
of trustees have included such young
men, voted in by their classmates, as

regular, voting trustees. In the light of
recent student unrest where students are
demanding more decision-making power
on campuses, this may be the first such
attempt to move toward an effective,
workable student representation.
Major Reform
This major reform changed a 70 year
old rule requiring that alumni be at least
ten years past graduation in order to be

trustees. This innovation permits the
election of trustees and opens doors for
new, younger men to be included
among the nine regular alumni trustees.
The standard method for choosing
the special trustees will be to open the
nominations only to seniors, with the
requirement that each candidate have a
petition signed by 25 seniors. This year,
in addition to the first senior voted in,
an exceptional second special trustee
will be elected from the graduating class
of 1968 by current seniors and the
previous three graduating classes. This
trustee will be chosen from the three
nominees put forth by the board of
governors of the class of 1968 which is
composed of former class officers.
By following this procedure, there
will be four special trustees on the
board by 1972, thus establishing the
complete cycle. Subsequently, one
senior will be voted in each year as
previous electees finish their four year
term.
This plan for re-modeling the
structures of a universities board of
trustees was proposed by the executive
committee of Princeton's Universities'
Alumni Council. Although not
demanded by the students at Princeton,
a university spokesman said that it
represents "the kind of thing they
want."
Coed Too
Princeton's innovative board also
approved an administration plan to
admit undergraduate women for the
first time in its 223-year history. The
plan allows for the enrollment of 90
freshmen and 40 transfer undergraduate
women students in this year alone. In
explaining this move, Robert F.
Goheen, the university's president,
stated that a "first plateau" of 650
coeds would be reached by 1974. Even
so, President Goheen made it clear that
the undergraduate enrollment of
approximately 3,200 males will not be
reduced.
