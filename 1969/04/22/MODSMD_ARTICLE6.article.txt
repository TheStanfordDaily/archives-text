A mill-in of 300-400 students
developed at Harvard's University Hall
yesterday from noon until 5 p.m. while
the president of Cornell declared a
"situation of emergency" stemming
from Sunday's armed takeover of the
student union.

At Columbia University, a third Ivy
League member, the dissident Students
for a Democratic Society invited pupils
from four high schools to join a campus
rally demanding open admissions for
pupils from those schools.
At Harvard, about 150 students
marched without opposition into the

hall, the school's main administration
building, carrying out an SDS vote
Sunday night to stay there until 5 p.m.
At its meeting, the SDS said it would
not accept anything less than full
expulsion of Reserve Officers Traini.ig
Corps on campus.
Earlier, school officials accepted a
faculty recommendation that ROTC be
made an extracurricular activity, and
promised to provide alternate housing
for residents of Cambridge and Boston
displaced by Harvard students.
The SDS is demanding full expulsion
of ROTC from the campus, while Negro
students also were calling for an active
voice in forming a black studies
department.
The mill-in followed by three days a
mass rally at Harvard stadium at which
4,000 students voted to end a week-old
class boycott.
At Ithaca, N.Y., Cornell's President
James A. Perkins pledged a series of
measures aimed at bringing back "law
and order and stability" in the wake of
a 36-hour occupation of the student
union building by gun-carrying Negroes.
Any organization promoting
occupation of buildings will be

disbanded, any student found carrying a
gun will be suspended, and nonstudents
will be arrested, Perkins said.
At Columbia, SDS leaders said they
were giving Acting President Dr.
Andrew Cordier one week to accede to
demands, including abolition of ROTC,
the admission of more Negroes to the
university and a priority student voice
in black studies programs.
