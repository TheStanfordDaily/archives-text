# Statement

### 
We understand that a series of
discussions is to be held Tuesday, April
22 on the subject of SU-SRI relations
and other matters of research policy.
Full and balanced discussion of these
issues is useful in view of the
forthcoming discussions on them. We
hope that as many faculty and students
as possible will participate, consistent
with their other obligations.
Accordingly, faculty members are
encouraged to make arrangements,
including cancellation or rescheduling of
classes, to permit attendance at these
discussions.
Kenneth S. Pilzer, President
Richard Lyman, Provost
