# SJC Follows-Up AEL Disruption
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
40 signatures have been appended to
a statement requesting prosecution of
the demonstrators who sat in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory (AEL)
in protest of campus research policies.
Under the Legislative and Judicial
Charter of 1968, those persons "directly
aggrieved" by actions on campus can
request a hearing before the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC).
The SJC has jurisdiction over the
case against the demonstrators, and has
had since April 11th, when University
President Kenneth Pitzer notified the
Council that the sit-in was in violation
of the University Policy on Campus
Disorders.
The Council met last Thursday at
which time it reached the decision that
"extraordinary circumstances" existed,
and recommended that Pitzer be
granted "emergency power" to end the
sit-in.
No Names As Yet
Professor Jack Friedenthal, chairman
of the SJC, told the Daily that "the case
was sent to us without names. Some
names apparently have been taken, but I
have not seen the list."
Dean of Students Joel Smith, when
contacted, stated that "I am conducting
an investigation. I will assemble some
information and forward it to the
Judicial Council." He emphasized that
the Judicial Council only has
jurisdiction in the case.
Smith also indicated that the
information he planned to forward
would include identifications of some
AEL demonstrators.
Prosecution Request
The question of request for
prosecution arose when Friedenthal was

asked to comment about the possibility
of amnesty being granted to the
sit-inners. "We have some difficulties,"
Friedenthal stated. "If the President
doesn't want to prosecute, we have a list
of people who do. Forty signatures are
appended to it."
The Council will consider
prosecution of the demonstrators as a
group if the group so desires according
to Friedenthal. "We would have to see
the complicity statement. If the Council
thinks it has validity, and if the people
want to be tried together, we'll try them
together."
The complicity statement, worded
simply, "I am sitting in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory. Wish you were
here," has reportedly been signed by
over 1400 people. The April 3
Movement still is in possession of that
statement. It has not been turned in to
the SJC.
