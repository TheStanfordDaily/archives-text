# The 						Election: Cory-Schulz
## 
### 
Last week the student body
approved the Hayes' constitution
and adopted a governmental
structure ' that can unite the
various interests of our campus
community in a concerted process
of change.
Consistent with this indication
of priorities, today and tomorrow
voters will select a president and
vice-president to represent
students in the confrontations,
consultations, and decisions of
next year. The ticket of Bob Cory
and Eckhard Schulz has spoken to
the issues in an otherwise
uninspiring and uneventful
presidential campaign.
The choice presented by the
four man ticket is inconsistent
with this spirit of change for two
reasons.
First, the "committee
presidency" has consistently
refused to release concrete
positions on specific issues. The
voters have a right to know the
views of any potential executive
which transcends Pat Shea's
reluctance to reduce "lengthy
position papers" to views that
students can examine.
Secondly, a "four student
presidency" would seriously
undermine the efficiency of the
newly organized student
government. The point at which
discussion ends and action begins
requires leadership whose
authority is not fragmented.
! Crises in this University to not

follow a monthly schedule, and,
as such, require that there be a
consistent representation of
student interests.
In contrast to the other ticket,
Cory and Schulz would supply
not only unified leadership, but a
solid specific platform for needed
changes at Stanford. Consider
what Cory-Schulz propose.
The establishment of a
Department of Urban and
Environmental Studies, which
would take an interdisciplinary
approach to the solutions of the
major problems confronting urban
areas, such as transportation,
congestion, housing and pollution.
Under this Department of Urban

and Environmental Studies one
could not only bring in the talents
and resources of a variety of
Departments, but establish
individual programs whereby
students would be able to receive
academic credit for research and
field work in communities and
urban areas working on various
problems.
Both Cory and Schulz have
pointed up their strong support of
the adoption of an individually
designed academic program for
each student. It was Schulz in
Student Education Council who
seconded the motion for the
abolition of all university
requirements aside from the basic
180 units. Favoring
interdepartmental majors and
only departmental requirements
both Cory and Schulz are grasping
one of the issues most basic to
student educational needs and
freedoms.
They recognized that funds
should be provided to allow
several Stanford organizations, to
be determined by Student
referendum (such as the 8.5. U.,
Iâ€”Center, Bus. School, etc.), to
print newsletters so that the entire
campus community can be made
aware of their activities and views.
To solve potential legal problems,
these newsletters might be
included as Daily supplements.
Today when you vote, consider
the form of government, consider
the issues.
