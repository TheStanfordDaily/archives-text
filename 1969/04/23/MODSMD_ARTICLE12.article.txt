# The
						Election: Shea-Grube
## 
### 
At anyone of five points last
week, The Stanford student body
president made decisions and
offered advice that affected the
entire University, thousands of
employees at Stanford Research
Institute, and millions of dollars
in investment. The decisions had
to be right.
One person could not possibly
be right 24 hours a day.
The responsibilities and
demands of student leadership at
Stanford have proliferated in the
past two years. Perhaps more than
advisable, people look to the
student body president to speak
for the entire Stanford student
population. At the same time, the
ASSU president has internal
demands to keep the organization
of ASSU functioning and keep a
flow of ideas pouring into
University decision-making.
There is an acute crisis in
University governance today.
Stanford needs student leadership
with judgment, balance, and guts.
It needs people experienced in
Stanford affairs with strong
feelings about issues. Four
students who have been deeply
involved in critical University
matters this year are running as a
Council of Presidents.

They believe that running
student government is a full time
job for four people. They are:
Barry Askinas—a graduate
student in sociology, president of
the Graduate Student Association,
a member of the Student
Education Council (SEC), and a
tutor in Otero.
John Grube —a senior in
political science, SEC member,
and former Assistant Student
Financial Manager, and a sponsor
in Trancos.
Joyce Kobayashi—a junior in
Philosophy, SEC member, and
chairman of the Nigerian-Biafran
Relief Fund.
Pat Shea—a junior in political
science, member of SEC, and a
member of the University
Advisory Council.
The facts speak for themselves.
These people are and have been
committed to Stanford.
They have created change, not
just talked about it. Askinas has
fought long and hard for better
housing. Kobayashi organized the
successful, life saving fund raising
campaign to help starving children
in Nigeria and Biafra. Grube has
worked toward educational
reform. Shea has worked all year
trying to persuade the trustees to

expand and diversify. These
people know the issues because
they helped define them
The Council of Presidents
stands for bringing SRI closer to
Stanford and making it into a
graduate research university,
patterned after the Rockefeller
University in New York. They
believe the moral issues involved
in war-related research must be
addressed and the University and
SRI must stop building
destruction.
They believe that the
discussions of SES are dragging
and that students cannot and
should not wait much longer to
see requirements reduced and
freedom extended in study.
They will forcefully deal with
the problem of housing. Stanford
has failed to understand that it
cannot call itself a residence
university without residences.
Stanford is moving. Students
are demanding change. They must
have articulate and knowledgeable
leadership; proven leadership.
The crucial decision in the
election today and tomorrow is
not style. It is ability.
Capability is proven under fire.
Askinas, Grube, Kobayashi, and
Shea have passed the test.
