## On The Majority's Side 
### Victor Hori 
The SRI Committee report has
been widely ignored. Nevertheless
the Majority Statement has been
condemned as if it were a piece of
scurrilous polemic. I intend to
show that the Majority Statement
is politically defensible.
The Majority Statement
separates the moral issue (research
in CBW, COIN, VNW) from the
issue of the institutional
relationship (sale or control of
SRI by Stanford University).
These are distinct and separate
questions whose answers depend
on different sets of criteria; they
should not be confused with each
other as is now the case in the
public mind.
On the moral issue, the
Majority recommends restraints
for the obvious reason that
University involvement in CBW,
COIN, VNW research is beyond
moral limits and politically
imprudent. Restraints on such
research can be enforced so long
as the restraints are explicitly
defined and written into the
conditions of sale.
I do not find David Pugh's
arguments (Daily, April 18) very
convincing. They are not
convincing, first, because he is not
a lawyer in corporation law (and
on this point, expert knowledge is
the deciding factor); second,
because he in no way
substantiates the claim that the
Attorney General would force the
University to sell SRI without
restrictive covenants; third,
because, in claiming that the
courts generally only "enforce
covenants protecting a creditor's
investment or profit margin," he
makes no distinction between
cases of mortgage (where he is
partly right) and cases of sale
(where he is wrong).
The Movement Position
The April 3 Movement wants
to do more than get rid of
objectionable research; it wants to
redirect SRI into socially
constructive research. Although it
looks as though the Movement has
taken a Motherhood position, I
am nonetheless cynical.
First, over the next several
years, SRI will increase its
social-urban research partly
because of events on campus,
partly because of management
policy, but overwhelmingly
because the research and
development market is expanding
into social-urban problems. With a
few exceptions, SRI research has
always followed the Rand D
market, and SRI policy has
changed to conform to new
market developments after the
fact. The same will happen here:
as the Rand D market expands
into social-urban areas, so also
SRI will expand its research into
these areas.
Second, it is not at all obvious
to me that such social-urban
research is ultimately desirable, or
constructive. If such social-urban
research (along with other parts of
the Great Society program) were
very successful, we might be able
to eradicate the poverty areas, the
tenderloins, the ghettos, and then
assimilate these people into the
great middle class of the Great
Society.
30 to 50 Million
As of now, there are from 30
to 50 million people in such areas
who, just because they are not
part of the Great Society, have a
proto-revolutionary
consciousness; they already live in
natural counter-cultures. Massive

social-urban research over the
next few years may raise these
people, but in the process they
will lose their proto-revolutionary
consciousness and come to believe
in 'the American way of life.'
Recall that 30-40 years ago,
the poor working class was a
natural counter-culture with a
proto-revolutionary
consciousness; but with material
welfare came ideology. Now
labour and big business both
believe the 'what's good for
General Motors is good for the
United States.' Social-urban
research will like-wise co-opt the
ghetto, the poverty areas, and the
tenderloins. Is SRI research in
such areas really desirable? (The
answer, of course, is Yes and No.)
Ivory Power
Experience tells me that one's
position on these issues is
fundamentally determined by
one's conception of the
University's place in society. The
April 3 Movement chastises the
immediate and direct
proto-revolutionary social
change—lvory Power. Although I
am sympathetic to the aims of
such an institution, such a
proto-revolutionary University is
not practically possible.
The University which takes a
counter-ideological
proto-revolutionary stand will
face massive repression against
which the University will not be
able to protect itself. The
University has political power to
protect itself only insofar as it
supports the dominant ideology
of the nation-state elite; it could
not use this political power to
overthrow the nation-state elite
itself.
At the Student Body meeting
last Friday, Professor Perls stated
that a University which mounts
effective criticism of society
would get 'pushed back'—funds
would decrease, research would
get cut back, other programs
would have to stop. And, of
course, the great Stanford student
body rose in applause to this
suggestion of 'doing without' for a
little while (a salve to their
consciences). But 'pushed back' is
a drastic understatement of the
forces that are even now
marshalling themselves to repress
the University. Let me indicate
some of these.
Federal Funds
By the end of summer 1968,
Congress in Washington had
passed the Broyhill and Wyman
amendments which gave Congress
the power to cut off all federal
funds to any school which did not
deal adequately with student
protest. Imagine what it could
mean for all federal funds to stop
coming into Stanford University!
If this happened, the Medical
Center and SLAC would close
down within a month; 90% of all
academic research would stop;
government sponsored fellowships
would stop; faculty would start to
leave en masse —and the University
as it now stands would effectively
be destroyed. This is not just
'pushed back'; this is massive
political repression.
Another example of repression
which Stanford University
fortunately does not have to face
in such direct terms. In the
California Legislature, there are
now 132 bills waiting to be
discussed, all calling for heavier
punitive measures for student
protest, control of faculty hiring
and student admissions, and

restrictions on University
autonomy.
Ivory Tower-Power
The true power of the
University, the true ground of its
influence in society, has resided in
the Ivory Tower. The University,
because ••it was (supposedly)
outside the reign of the dominant
ideology in society, constituted a
natural counter-culture. The Ivory
Tower could pursue truth and
knowledge, and since truth and
knowledge are not politically
neutral, the Ivory Tower (again
supposedly) stood against the
mainstream of society. Ivory
Power originates in the Ivory
Tower.
With regret, 'supposedly' has
been interjected into these
statements for the University has
never fully achieved the status of
an autonomous 'free republic of
scholars.' The modern American
University is far from being an
autonomous Ivory Tower for it
surrendered its autonomy and
intellectual independence long
ago. There are two sides to this.
First of all, the University
thought that it had to do all
things for all people (all in the
name of education and research).
Hence all manner of ancillary
enterprises were attached to the
University which have no essential
place in the University. Hence
Stanford now runs a hospital, a
ship, a series of overseas
campuses, several housing tracts,
an Industrial Park, SRI, and other
projects. It used to be said that a
University was a factory; it has
now become a corporate
conglomerate. And in the process,
the primary mission of education
and basic research gets forgotten.
Second, the intellectual
disciplines themselves have been
ideologically infiltrated. The
humanities and social sciences
have developed new conceptions
of themselves and of their
methodologies—new conceptions
which are ideologically
determined.
History now believes itself to be a
social science and no longer a
humanities. Psychology believes
itself to be a hard science and no
longer a social science. Political
science and sociology believe that
they should be devoted to
empirical research. And the
humanities in general have
accepted the dictum that since
they do not deal with empirical
fact, therefore they deal with
mere subjective opinion.
The humanities have come to
believe the dogma that they
cannot know; they only feel. The
normative and critical questions
of what a good society is, of what
human nature is, of what
democracy truly means —all such
normative and critical questions
are excluded as lacking 'empirical
content.'
And without such normative
criticism built right into the
system, we are now getting the
'equilibrium' theory of political
society which nicely rationalises
the status quo; we are getting a
concept of human nature which
makes no room for 'personal
being' since it cannot be reduced
to empirically observable
behaviour; and we are getting
philosophical arguments to show
that moral questions are reaily
'emotive' and that there really are
no such things as moral facts.
Ideology has infected the life of
the mind. The power of the Ivory
Tower has been co-opted.

Here then is my argument for
selling SRI. Selling SRI is but one
part of a program to purify the
University. First, we need to get
rid of all ancillary activities of the
University which do not promote
education and basic research and
which compromise the economic,
political and intellectual
autonomy of the University. The
University is not a corporate
conglomerate: it ought not to
own SRI, to own Industrial Park,
to run a travel service to overseas
campuses, to build housing
projects for students, and faculty,
and so on.
Second, the government of the
University has to be transformed.
Although the historical evidence
shows that there needs to be a
Board of Trustees representing
society at large (in order to keep
the University responsive to social
needs), essentially the University
must be self-governed by a council
of faculty and students. The
University must be self-governing
not because the University ought
to be democratic (teaching is not
democratic) but because the
University must be free.
Third, the intellectual
disciplines have to be reformed.
Here I do not mean changes in the
structure of the curriculum nor
changes in regulations and
requirements; here I mean that a
series of value judgements and
ideological judgements have to be
'•it forward and discussed.
New Funds
Fourth, we need to develop a
new means of getting funds for
the University which does not
compromise its autonomy. Most
important we need to find a
substitute for contract research
directly performed for outside
sponsors. If there could be
indirect sponsorship (e.g. through
consortia of universities
distributing government funds to
universities) or if there could be
in-house sponsorship of research,
we could then start to rebuild
autonomy of the University.
In the controversy over SRI,
what is most dismaying is that
individuals have stopped thinking
as individuals and have let their
thinking be dominated by
ideological positions. The political
position of the SDS against sale of
SRI was announced as early as last
November in the Wall Street
Journal. At that time, I too, was
against sale of SRI because sale of
SRI (at that time) meant that
there could be no action taken on
the issue of immoral and
objectionable research.
But since then it has become
clear that the sale-control issue is
separate and distinct from the
moral issue (again read the SRI
Committee report—M aj ority
Statement). The SDS could not,
of course be expected to change
its position once announced, but
certainly individuals can and
should change their positions with
the introduction of new evidence
and arguments. Individuals who
have come to see that the SDS's
political orientation is
fundamentally right fail to see
that on specific issues the SDS can
still be wrong. The SRI issue is
one of them.
Do your own think!
Sell SRI!
