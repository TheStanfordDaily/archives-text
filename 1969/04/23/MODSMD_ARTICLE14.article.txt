## America's Secret Ballot: How Much Change Has It Affected? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
On the front page of last
Saturday's Chronicle the President
of the United States was quoted
as warning against hopes "that
peace in Vietnam is around the
corner." He went on to praise the
government of Premier Thieu,
who was reported on page 9 to
have just shut down another
South Vietnamese newspaper.
President Nixon was also quoted
as saying of the $6 billion ABM
system, "I am going to fight as
hard as I can for it."
I cite these items only as
examples of how little has been
changed by rational discussion,
the secret ballot, and
knowledgeable advice from
experts, during the past five years.
When Lyndon Johnson
escalated the war, after
hoodwinking Congress with the
Gulf of Tonkin incident, hundreds
of experts from major universities,
including Stanford, used their
contacts with Washington to plead
urgently for a change in policy.
Long before sit-ins and marches,
when the teach-in was still a
controversial tactic, responsible
adults were speaking out against
the growing militarization of this
country.
Quite obviously, this activity
made very little dent on the
entrenched political and military
leadership of this country. When
Dr. Panofsky recently expressed
his criticism of the ABM he was
only one of the nation's leading
scientists to have done so; some
made their case within the White
House itself. Yet their expert
opinions were dismissed, and for
reasons any alert non-expert can
understand.
About six weeks ago I heard
the president of a firm in the

Stanford Industrial Park tell a
hundred or so high school boys
that the only drawback to being
an engineer was that you couldn't
always work on what you wanted
to work onâ€”you had to do what
"the market" called for in order
to make any money.
Consequently, he said, his firm
did most of its work for the
military.
He then showed an impressive
color film of the company at
work in its various well-designed
buildings, in California and
Maryland. The final scene showed
a gleaming white missile poised
against a very blue sky in, as I
remember, Japan. The boys
applauded heartily.
From time to time since then
I've had a sort of waking
nightmare, of the day when the
efforts of all the dedicated people
at Lockheed, Raytheon, Western
Electric, Watkins-Johnson, and
perhaps Stanford University,
finally bear fruit. All of their
complicated gadgets, cased in
beautiful white missiles, soar up
into the very blue sky. MIRV and
Polaris and Safeguard ABMs go
into operation, along with the
Russian SS9 and whatever else
their dedicated scientists have
been working on.
Finally, in the smoking ruins
that are left in this country, one
charred survivor murmurs to
another, "Well, at least we didn't
give in to coercive tactics." "Yes,"
groans the other, "we relied on
the secret ballot and orderly
dissent right up to the end."
I assume the students sat in at
AEL because they also have
nightmare visions of the future.
By now the building they
occupied is just as it was before

last week, but hopefully the rest
of us have been changed, if only
by the realization that it took
something more than rational
discourse to awaken Stanford
fully to the urgency of the
dangers we face.
I hope ripples from their
non-violent demonstration are felt
across the country; considering
what it accomplished here, there
is some hope that they will be.

What's The Deal?
Editor, THE DAILY:
This letter a appeared in April
17's University of Washington
Daily.
Editor, THE DAILY:
Please keep informed of
action at Stanford against
secret chem-bio-warfare and
other Vietnam war-related
research. Same kinds of
research take place at your
campus. Public inquiry now,
repeat now, is essential. We
seek your support. This
message going nationwide.
Please publish it.
Telegram from
The Stanford DAILY
I think you owe an explanation
about the letter to the Stanford
community. While it is the
obligation of responsible
journalists to take positions upon
controversial issues and to
attempt to sway public opinion, it
is not within their jurisdiction to
become primary combatants in a
critical dispute. At this time, the
University is in grave need of an
objective and trustworthy source
of information. You can no longer
be trusted to perform that
function. I call for your
resignation and apology.

Editors Note: The Daily regrets
that Mr. Wessells misread the
telegram, concluding that it stated
that chemical-biological warfare
research is conducted at Stanford
University. The telegram syntax is
indeed somewhat ambiguous. The
emphasis was on "action" at
Stanford to stop research not
necessarily at the University.
Stanford, in fact, does no
chemical-biological warfare
research.
SCLC Broach
Editor, THE DAILY:
Yale Braunstein's letter of
Friday, April 18, is misleading and
misinformed. In it he claims that:
1. The SCLC has authority to
"legislate in all areas of student
conduct, including the power to
state 'that specified forms of
non-academic conduct are not the
proper subject of University
control.' "
2. Mr. Friedenthal denies or
fails to understand this fact.
3. Mr. Friedenthal has acted in
"a cavalier fashion" and has
abused the authority of the
Judicial Council.
4. Until the members of the
Council stop Mr. Friedenthal from
abusing its authority, students and
faculty should ignore actions of
the Council.
Mr. Braunstein's letter relates
(one must assume) to an incident
of Wednesday night: During an
open hearing of the Judicial
Council regarding the activities of
the past week at AEL, Richard
Such, a member of the SCLC,
passed a copy of a prospective
rule which SCLC had voted a few

minutes earlier to publish to the
counsel appointed by the SJC to
represent the interests of those
occupying the AEL. This was read
to the Council, and informal
discussion ensued until Mr.
Friedenthal objected to
continuing the discussion on the
grounds that the SCLC had
overstepped its jurisdiction by
interrupting a hearing of the
Judicial Council to read a copy of
action which may become legally
binding in 45 days.
Mr. Friedenthal's objection was
not, as Mr. Braunstein implies,
based on the legality of the
SCLC's action itself, but rather to
Mr. Such's unjustified attempt to
interfere with the hearing.
The SCLC's breach of its
jurisdiction was not, then, in the
rule it passed, but in the
presentation of the prospective
rule which imposes no legal
constraints on present Judicial
Council action to the Judicial
Council during a hearing in
progress.
Beyond his apparent failure to
understand the substance of Mr.
Friedenthal's objection, Mr.
Braunstein fails to substantiate
any "abuses of the SJC's
authority by its chairman." Mr.
Friedenthal did not act
unilaterally in stopping further
discussion of the SCLC's action
on Wednesday night. Paul
Holdorf, who was asking
substantive questions of Mr. Such
at the time of Mr. Friedenthal's
objection, volunteered to refrain
from asking further questions on
the matter. Mr. Friedenthal then
asked the Council if they wished
to rule on his objection, and no
member chose to request a vote to
overrule him. His actions were

unquestionably within his
authority as Chairman of the
Council, and did not in any sense
abuse the SJC's authority.
Finally, I would like to point
out that the signers to the Dissent
to the Council's decision of April
17, 1969 were Paul S. Holdorf
and Richard J. Lee, not Paul
Holden and Michael Lee. as
printed in the Daily Friday.

On Morality
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is both unfortunate and
disturbing that the morality of
certain research has been an issue
of the AEL sit-in. Academic
freedom certainly means freedom
in inquiry. Labeling certain kinds
of research "immoral" denies
freedom of inquiry and is an
attack on academic freedom.
Moral certitude has
characterized some of the most
infamous incidents in the history
of man. The April 3rd Movement
joins Senator McCarthy (Joe, not
Gene), Carrie Nation and the
Prohibitionists, the proponents of
State laws prohibiting the
teaching of evolution, and the
supporters of the Salem witch
trials, in adding another infamous
incident to our history.
If research at Stanford had to
pass review by a morality
committee, there is much that
conceivably could be considered
"immoral" by others on the
Stanford faculty for one reason or
another. Population control
research might be considered
immoral by some. Organ
transplant- research might be
considered immoral by others.
Research on the effects of illegal

drugs might also be questioned.
In fact, freedom of inquiry has
been respected at Stanford and all
of this research is going on. This is
as it should be. Individual
researchers continually make
moral decisions and this right
must be respected if learning is to
be advanced.
Many disciplines have fought
the battle of academic freedom.
Those in literature, history,
biology, and philosophy have all
fought and won with the help and
support of those in other
disciplines. The battle now is
being fought by engineers. We
deserve the support of other
disciplines, including those who
have won their battles, in defense
against the current attack.
This is not to say that
discussions of morality in research
have no place on the Stanford
campus. They belong and are
welcome. It is likely that such
discussions will change the
judgments of some persons, both
students and faculty. It is also
likely that some will, after
discussion, retain their original
moral judgments. Those
judgments must be respected and
the persons holding particular
views should not be subject to
coercion, physical or otherwise,
nor should they be subject to
harassment. Gene E. Willeke
