# From The Ivory Tower
## Needed Research Peace, Not War 
### Frank F. Foster 
The existence of war research
on campus is one of the several
important moral issues currently
being discussed at Stanford. In
those conversations I have heard
of or taken part in there seem to
be two points of view expressed.
Most often it is said that war
research is responsible for killing
people, that war research further
profits the military-industrial
complex (and is probably
encouraged by that group), that
the existence of such a group and
the fact of war research
demonstrate the moral
bankruptcy of this country;
furthermore that it is absurd to do
war research when the military
force of this country is already
sufficient to destroy any potential
enemy several times over.

The replies have been running
something like this: the best
defense is a good offense, for the
only deterrent a potential enemy
will consider effective is the
possibility of suffering retaliation;
consequently, war research does
not kill as many people as it saves.
Further Points
It is also suggested that this
country is no more morally
bankrupt than others, for no
sovereign state seems to take
disarmament seriously and more
than a few want a nuclear power.
Another point offered is that war
research must continue in order to
prevent a potential enemy from
gaining a technical superiority in
weaponry which would nullify
our ability to retaliate.
Were the discussions on war

research more concerned with a
critical but open-minded
examination of military facts and
priorities it might be possible to
unite the Stanford community
behind a strong moral conviction
based on reason. Instead the
community is disintegrating into
emotional factions. The
opponents of war research feel a
world of destruction is horrible
and unthinkable, and by
association so are the people
(including some of their former
friends) who are unwilling to
abolish all arms and are skeptical
about a Utopian world free of
killing, bombs and warfare. On
the other side, the hawks
condemn their former friends who
dare to hope for a world where
realism means the assertion of life

and creativity, not power politics
and material glut.
Perhaps there is a way for the
Stanford community to take a
strong moral stand for the forces
of life and at the same time do
something practical for a better
world â€”without endangering
national security. This is possible
because if the rhetoric and
emotions of the factions are set
aside, nearly everyone agrees that
they want a world free of nuclear
terror. (Don't you?) Our
differences would seem to be
about means not ends. If that is
true, why not get together and use
our energies working for
something we all want? What
follows is one suggestion along
those lines.
There are two parts to this
proposal. The first is that in
speaking of war research a
distinction must be made between
offensive weaponry and defensive
capability. Weapons are a
provocation to any enemy as well
as a temptation to adventurers in
this country. More fundamentally,
offensive systems are inconsistent
with the ideals for which this
country stands. Yet defensive
capability seems necessary so long
as there are offensive weapons
which could be used against us.
But what is a defensive capability?
A Definition
I would define it as that which
made ineffective any offensive
weapon that might be used against
us. I would add that in researching
and building defensive capabilities
the goal should be to disarm
weapons in a manner which itself
would not be destructive of life.
In other words, let's use our
technological know-how to
produce deterrents so effective
that the world will see nuclear
warheads as the unimaginative,
useless things they are. It follows
that not all the work done or to
be done at AEL (and perhaps
SRI) is offensive. In fact, to judge
by the red-jacketed pamphlet
entitled "The Goods on AEL:
Declassified by the April 3
Movement" much of what AEL
now does is, or can be, defensive
capability as defined.

In deciding whether a system is
defensive its use must be
examined. Signal jammers, for
example, could be used
offensively to prevent an enemy
from realizing we were launching
an attack on him; they could also
be used to prevent enemy radar
from locating and consequently
destroying the defensive
capability we would use in the
event of enemy attack.
Other Complexities
There are other complexities in
the use of weapons. Perhaps
(though I really do not know) the
only deterrent against biological
agents would be some kind of
antidote introduced in the
atmosphere where dangerous
germs were previously released.
But until our deterrents are
sufficiently sophisticated not to
be destructive of life, there is the
possibility that defensive
capability can be used offensively.
That leads to the second part of
this proposal. Defensive capability
must not be used except in
accordance with previously
established principles, principles
which would be formulated by
the people through their
government.
Proposal Consistent
This proposal is consistent with
the traditional American policy of
controlling the military through
civilian authority. It follows that
secret research is impossible.
Anyway, open research may be a
more effective deterrent because
if an enemy knows we can nullify
his weapons he may abandon
them. Perhaps an enemy would
then try to find a new weapon for
which we have no deterrent. He
might, but in the meantime we
can go on identifying and
deterring new weapons without
sharing the moral shame for
producing such weapons. It could
also be that by regaining the moral
initiative by not making weapons
we would set an example to
others more conducive to world
peace.
An implication of this proposal
is that as effective, benign
deterrents become available,
scrapping of the nuclear warheads

and other offensive weapons
becomes possible. Disarmament
therefore need not depend on the
hope for universal goodwill
(which is in doubt) but on the
very things in which this country
excels: material abundance,
technological know-how and a
traditionally representative form
of government.
Another Implication
Another implication is that
defensive capability may be just as
expensive as offensive, but is not
the security greater? Finally, it
can be said that benign deterrents
and effective popular control of
defensive capabilities present
unusually difficult problems. Yes,
they do, but simple solutions to
complex problems are never
lasting or effective.
Truly defensive capability may
be more difficult, but it can be
more effective in promoting
peace; truly representative
government may be more
complex but who would prefer
either anarchy or authoritarian
ism? People who take strong
moral stands have been exhibiting
enormous energy. Why not use
that energy for the difficult work
of peace? I intend to remain
optimistic until convinced that
hard work will not succeed. It has
not yet been tried. Why not get
together and get on with it?
