# An Open Letter
## SRI Report Contains Flaws 
### Leon S. Otis 
Gentlemen of the SRI
Com mittee:
Your report has been
circulated to the SRI staff, and as
you might imagine, it has
motivated considerable discussion
about its contents and
recommendations. Here are my
ideas regarding the main flaw in
your report.
One of your main concerns
with SRI has to do with the
"morality" of some of its research
activities. This concern transcends
the relationship of SRI to the
university or the resolution of the
SRI-SU relationship. In taking this
stance, gentlemen, I suggest that
you are rushing in "where angels
fear to tread."
"What," may I ask, "is the
definition of immoral research?"
and "who is to determine the
validity of whatever definition is
offered?"
Hard To See
You are trying to tell SRI (and
I expect that in very short order
that you, or others at SU, will be
telling your own university
officials) that you can spot
immoral research when you see it
and that you are morally
committed to doing whatever you
can to prevent its continuation. I
would support you to the hilt if
you could convince me that you
can really spot immoral research.
To make my point, let's take
the type of research to which you
object the most strongly, whether
done at SRI (where it represented,

incidentally 0.1 of 1% of the
research done during 1968) or
elsewhere —CW and BW
research—and contrast is with a
type of research which few (with
the possible exception of the
Catholic Church) would normally
consider immoral, i.e., population
control research.

Is, gentlemen, CW and BW
research any more immoral and
reprehensible than research aimed
at controlling population growth?
Is it morally defensible to plan
and support research aimed at
robbing untold millions in future
generations of the chance to live?
Would it not be more morally
defensible 112 r those who have
experienced life (you and 10 to
voluntarily "cash out" after I
number of years of life in order to
make room for those coming
along, that it is for us to be
seeking the means to prolong our
own lives as long as possible and
prevent these potential millions
from ever living at all?
Tricky Issue
You can see, I hope, that the
issue of morality, as applied to
research, is a tricky one and not
one that can be settled by your
committee, or any other group
that I can think of, except
society-at-large. One's conscience
must be the only ultimate guide.
Also, will you deny the
right —indeed, the obligation —of
the legally constituted
government of this country to
decide what steps it should take

(including research) to preserve
itself and insure the "public
good?" If the public disagrees
with government's policies,
mechanisms are available
(primarily the ballot) for changing
these policies. In the meantime,
the degree to which research
organizations respond to the
research needs of the government
is a matter of organizational
policy as determined by the Board
of Directors of the organizations
involved, and the availability and
willingness of individual
researchers to undertake the work
proposed.
In closing, I suggest that a
moral philosophy which
pre-empts the rights of others to
determine the morality of their
own behavior, is a questionable
morality. I respect your right to
feel that what I am doing may be
immoral, but you must respect
my right to make that ultimate
decision for myself.

morality. I respect your right to
feel that what I am doing may be
immoral, but you must respect
my right to make that ultimate
decision for myself.

Gentlemen of the SRI
Com mittee:
Your report has been
circulated to the SRI staff, and as
you might imagine, it has
motivated considerable discussion
about its contents and
recommendations. Here are my
ideas regarding the main flaw in
your report.
One of your main concerns
with SRI has to do with the
"morality" of some of its research
activities. This concern transcends
the relationship of SRI to the
university or the resolution of the
SRI-SU relationship. In taking this
stance, gentlemen, I suggest that
you are rushing in "where angels
fear to tread."
"What," may I ask, "is the
definition of immoral research?"
and "who is to determine the
validity of whatever definition is
offered?"
Hard To See
You are trying to tell SRI (and
I expect that in very short order
that you, or others at SU, will be
telling your own university
officials) that you can spot
immoral research when you see it
and that you are morally
committed to doing whatever you
can to prevent its continuation. I
would support you to the hilt if
you could convince me that you
can really spot immoral research.
To make my point, let's take
the type of research to which you
object the most strongly, whether
done at SRI (where it represented,

incidentally 0.1 of 1% of the
research done during 1968) or
elsewhere —CW and BW
research—and contrast is with a
type of research which few (with
the possible exception of the
Catholic Church) would normally
consider immoral, i.e., population
control research.

Is, gentlemen, CW and BW
research any more immoral and
reprehensible than research aimed
at controlling population growth?
Is it morally defensible to plan
and support research aimed at
robbing untold millions in future
generations of the chance to live?
Would it not be more morally
defensible 112 r those who have
experienced life (you and 10 to
voluntarily "cash out" after I
number of years of life in order to
make room for those coming
along, that it is for us to be
seeking the means to prolong our
own lives as long as possible and
prevent these potential millions
from ever living at all?
Tricky Issue
You can see, I hope, that the
issue of morality, as applied to
research, is a tricky one and not
one that can be settled by your
committee, or any other group
that I can think of, except
society-at-large. One's conscience
must be the only ultimate guide.
Also, will you deny the
right —indeed, the obligation —of
the legally constituted
government of this country to
decide what steps it should take

(including research) to preserve
itself and insure the "public
good?" If the public disagrees
with government's policies,
mechanisms are available
(primarily the ballot) for changing
these policies. In the meantime,
the degree to which research
organizations respond to the
research needs of the government
is a matter of organizational
policy as determined by the Board
of Directors of the organizations
involved, and the availability and
willingness of individual
researchers to undertake the work
proposed.
In closing, I suggest that a
moral philosophy which
pre-empts the rights of others to
determine the morality of their
own behavior, is a questionable
morality. I respect your right to
feel that what I am doing may be
immoral, but you must respect
my right to make that ultimate
decision for myself.
