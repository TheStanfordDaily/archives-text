## Liberation Movements Unreal 
### Gilbert Diaz, Jr 
The Saturday article "Rally
Airs Research" treated the Frost
ASSU meeting most inadequately.
I would like to explain the proper
context of what I said, and also
elaborate on what is at stake in
the current crisis at Stanford.
My remarks followed Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin's support of the
BSU policy which strongly
endorsed and urged further tactics
of coercion and insurrection in
Stanford, E. Palo Alto, and
various other places in the world.
I questioned the legitimacy of
the "liberation" movements,
including the local one, and
reminded the self-annointed
saviours that their course of
action had been rejected twice by
the Stanford student body in
secret-ballot voting. Apparently
"participatory democracy"
excludes this as irrelevant.
I then asked, Franklin, the
Coalition, and the world's
liberation movements why, before
initiating a coercive, destructive
"liberation," they did not take
time to ask those to be
"liberated" whether or not they
desired the said "liberation." To
which Mr. Malik replied with a
citriolic speech generously laden
with some very unoriginal
obscenities. He pointed to the
Vietnam and Latin American
"wars of national liberation" as
clear expressions of the Third
World People's desire to free
themselves of "exploiters."
M isrepresentation
This is a gross misrepresen
tation which does not hold up to
analysis.
An immediate end to the
American role in Vietnam would
help establish an oppressive
communist dictatorship which
would slaughter and imprison
many of Ho Chi Minh's
opponents. If the American role
there is exploitative (an
assumption I don't accept even
though I, too, am opposed to this
insane, endless war), and the V.C.
are the legitimate representatives
of the Vietnamese, what is the
moral superiority of Vietnamese
exploiting Vietnamese, over

Americans exploiting Vietnamese?
At least the V.C. are "nationalistic
patriots?"
One may rightly question the
rationality and perhaps the sanity
of the emotional, dogmatic
thinking which produced the
verbiage of Messrs. Malik and
Franklin.
While one can always find a
disgruntled, marxist movement in
the Latin American countires, the
important fact is that they are not
THE PEOPLE—they are minority
factions well organized for action
(like Stanford's). Rural banditry
and intermittent terrorism do not
add up to a revolutionary
movement.
Indonesia Cited
Malik should go and try to
"liberate" Indonesia. Indonesians
made a point perfectly clear after
the abortive communist coup
attempt of 1965: In perhaps an
unparalleled demonstration of a
most direct and participatory
democratic manisfestation, they
went seeking oul communists and
their Chinese sympathizers and
killed over 250,0000f them.
Malik might try the same trick
in So. Korea, Malaysia, Singapore,
Taiwan, India, and Pakistan.
Franklin might try convincing
India of the noble, revolutionary
goals of Mighty Mao and use as
evidence the Chinese troops who
are presently occupying
substantial parts of India's
northern frontier territories.
Common Knowledge
It is common knowledge that
communists and "liberators" of
the Malik and Maoist Franklin
type have never won control of a
nation by ballot. This is a tribute
to the rationality of the people
they contemptuously sneer and
look down at.
Like Stanford's own
self-styled, self-consecrated
liberators, most of these
visionaries are egomaniacs who
glory in obtaining authentic
political power and in bending
society to their will—one way or
another.
But at least Franklin and Malik

are honest enough to admit that
coercion and violence—the
simplistic recourse of the
savage—is their way of allegedly
helping man to progress.
Academic Senate, President
Pitzer, Administration,
conservatives, moderates, liberals,
and you CS-radicals: when some
in our community tell you you
are "worth crap" and hope to see
you "fucked to hell," they do
mean it; when they promise to do
their best to destroy all your
"oppressive" institutions (and
possibly you along with them),
they do mean to at least give it a
try.
As is demonstrable to the
rational, perceptive observer,
facing reality without dogmatic
perversion and its inevitable
distortion of reality is not possible
for the "true believer" of Holy
Radicalism. The outspoken
dogmatists of Frost reaffirmed
last Friday that argument by
assertion, demagoguery, and
shouting matches is their way of
discoursing with others.
The mindlessness of this
recourse is obvious (it should be,
by dear Stanford "thinkers,"
"intellectuals!"). It paves the way
for more coercion, violence,
intimidation and, if left
unchecked, for the eventual
destruction of a community. What
is being seen at Stanford if but a
small manifestation of this mental
sickness which assures us only of
destruction.
And what do our enlightened,
responsible, mature faculty
members and administrators do
about this? They appease it and
hope (pray?) it will then blow
away.
The intellectual and moral
bankruptcy of "those who should
know" is responsible for most of
the sanctioned and rewarded
insanity in our society. It is
probably expecting too much to
have them realize that they are
committing suicide, little by little,
bit by bit!

I would like to explain the proper
context of what I said, and also
elaborate on what is at stake in
the current crisis at Stanford.
My remarks followed Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin's support of the
BSU policy which strongly
endorsed and urged further tactics
of coercion and insurrection in
Stanford, E. Palo Alto, and
various other places in the world.
I questioned the legitimacy of
the "liberation" movements,
including the local one, and
reminded the self-annointed
saviours that their course of
action had been rejected twice by
the Stanford student body in
secret-ballot voting. Apparently
"participatory democracy"
excludes this as irrelevant.
I then asked, Franklin, the
Coalition, and the world's
liberation movements why, before
initiating a coercive, destructive
"liberation," they did not take
time to ask those to be
"liberated" whether or not they
desired the said "liberation." To
which Mr. Malik replied with a
citriolic speech generously laden
with some very unoriginal
obscenities. He pointed to the
Vietnam and Latin American
"wars of national liberation" as
clear expressions of the Third
World People's desire to free
themselves of "exploiters."

This is a gross misrepresen
tation which does not hold up to
analysis.
An immediate end to the
American role in Vietnam would
help establish an oppressive
communist dictatorship which
would slaughter and imprison
many of Ho Chi Minh's
opponents. If the American role
there is exploitative (an
assumption I don't accept even
though I, too, am opposed to this
insane, endless war), and the V.C.
are the legitimate representatives
of the Vietnamese, what is the
moral superiority of Vietnamese
exploiting Vietnamese, over

Americans exploiting Vietnamese?
At least the V.C. are "nationalistic
patriots?"
One may rightly question the
rationality and perhaps the sanity
of the emotional, dogmatic
thinking which produced the
verbiage of Messrs. Malik and
Franklin.
While one can always find a
disgruntled, marxist movement in
the Latin American countires, the
important fact is that they are not
THE PEOPLE—they are minority
factions well organized for action
(like Stanford's). Rural banditry
and intermittent terrorism do not
add up to a revolutionary
movement.
Indonesia Cited
Malik should go and try to
"liberate" Indonesia. Indonesians
made a point perfectly clear after
the abortive communist coup
attempt of 1965: In perhaps an
unparalleled demonstration of a
most direct and participatory
democratic manisfestation, they
went seeking oul communists and
their Chinese sympathizers and
killed over 250,0000f them.
Malik might try the same trick
in So. Korea, Malaysia, Singapore,
Taiwan, India, and Pakistan.
Franklin might try convincing
India of the noble, revolutionary
goals of Mighty Mao and use as
evidence the Chinese troops who
are presently occupying
substantial parts of India's
northern frontier territories.
Common Knowledge
It is common knowledge that
communists and "liberators" of
the Malik and Maoist Franklin
type have never won control of a
nation by ballot. This is a tribute
to the rationality of the people
they contemptuously sneer and
look down at.
Like Stanford's own
self-styled, self-consecrated
liberators, most of these
visionaries are egomaniacs who
glory in obtaining authentic
political power and in bending
society to their will—one way or
another.
But at least Franklin and Malik

are honest enough to admit that
coercion and violence—the
simplistic recourse of the
savage—is their way of allegedly
helping man to progress.

nation by ballot. This is a tribute
to the rationality of the people
they contemptuously sneer and
look down at.
Like Stanford's own
self-styled, self-consecrated
liberators, most of these
visionaries are egomaniacs who
glory in obtaining authentic
political power and in bending
society to their will—one way or
another.
But at least Franklin and Malik

are honest enough to admit that
coercion and violence—the
simplistic recourse of the
savage—is their way of allegedly
helping man to progress.
Academic Senate, President
Pitzer, Administration,
conservatives, moderates, liberals,
and you CS-radicals: when some
in our community tell you you
are "worth crap" and hope to see
you "fucked to hell," they do
mean it; when they promise to do
their best to destroy all your
"oppressive" institutions (and
possibly you along with them),
they do mean to at least give it a
try.
As is demonstrable to the
rational, perceptive observer,
facing reality without dogmatic
perversion and its inevitable
distortion of reality is not possible
for the "true believer" of Holy
Radicalism. The outspoken
dogmatists of Frost reaffirmed
last Friday that argument by
assertion, demagoguery, and
shouting matches is their way of
discoursing with others.
The mindlessness of this
recourse is obvious (it should be,
by dear Stanford "thinkers,"
"intellectuals!"). It paves the way
for more coercion, violence,
intimidation and, if left
unchecked, for the eventual
destruction of a community. What
is being seen at Stanford if but a
small manifestation of this mental
sickness which assures us only of
destruction.
And what do our enlightened,
responsible, mature faculty
members and administrators do
about this? They appease it and
hope (pray?) it will then blow
away.
The intellectual and moral
bankruptcy of "those who should
know" is responsible for most of
the sanctioned and rewarded
insanity in our society. It is
probably expecting too much to
have them realize that they are
committing suicide, little by little,
bit by bit!

The Saturday article "Rally
Airs Research" treated the Frost
ASSU meeting most inadequately.
I would like to explain the proper
context of what I said, and also
elaborate on what is at stake in
the current crisis at Stanford.
My remarks followed Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin's support of the
BSU policy which strongly
endorsed and urged further tactics
of coercion and insurrection in
Stanford, E. Palo Alto, and
various other places in the world.
I questioned the legitimacy of
the "liberation" movements,
including the local one, and
reminded the self-annointed
saviours that their course of
action had been rejected twice by
the Stanford student body in
secret-ballot voting. Apparently
"participatory democracy"
excludes this as irrelevant.
I then asked, Franklin, the
Coalition, and the world's
liberation movements why, before
initiating a coercive, destructive
"liberation," they did not take
time to ask those to be
"liberated" whether or not they
desired the said "liberation." To
which Mr. Malik replied with a
citriolic speech generously laden
with some very unoriginal
obscenities. He pointed to the
Vietnam and Latin American
"wars of national liberation" as
clear expressions of the Third
World People's desire to free
themselves of "exploiters."
M isrepresentation
This is a gross misrepresen
tation which does not hold up to
analysis.
An immediate end to the
American role in Vietnam would
help establish an oppressive
communist dictatorship which
would slaughter and imprison
many of Ho Chi Minh's
opponents. If the American role
there is exploitative (an
assumption I don't accept even
though I, too, am opposed to this
insane, endless war), and the V.C.
are the legitimate representatives
of the Vietnamese, what is the
moral superiority of Vietnamese
exploiting Vietnamese, over

Americans exploiting Vietnamese?
At least the V.C. are "nationalistic
patriots?"
One may rightly question the
rationality and perhaps the sanity
of the emotional, dogmatic
thinking which produced the
verbiage of Messrs. Malik and
Franklin.
While one can always find a
disgruntled, marxist movement in
the Latin American countires, the
important fact is that they are not
THE PEOPLE—they are minority
factions well organized for action
(like Stanford's). Rural banditry
and intermittent terrorism do not
add up to a revolutionary
movement.
Indonesia Cited
Malik should go and try to
"liberate" Indonesia. Indonesians
made a point perfectly clear after
the abortive communist coup
attempt of 1965: In perhaps an
unparalleled demonstration of a
most direct and participatory
democratic manisfestation, they
went seeking oul communists and
their Chinese sympathizers and
killed over 250,0000f them.
Malik might try the same trick
in So. Korea, Malaysia, Singapore,
Taiwan, India, and Pakistan.
Franklin might try convincing
India of the noble, revolutionary
goals of Mighty Mao and use as
evidence the Chinese troops who
are presently occupying
substantial parts of India's
northern frontier territories.
