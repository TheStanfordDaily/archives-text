## AEL Employees Talk Back 
### CHRIS PECK 
"After the sit-in began, it oecame
apparent that there was no adequate
response by the University that gave the
AEL position," AEL head, William
Rambo, stated in explaining the work of
a group of AEL employees who printed
a mass of pro-AEL leaflets and handouts
during last week's sit-in.
Group leader for the AEL
Community was Electrical Engineering
student and AEL employee, Scott
Borison. The AEL publications were a
"set the record type of deal," said
Borison. At its height, the AEL group
was turning out 10,000 handouts of its
position. Other leaflets were printed in
quantities of 1000 to 10,000.
When the sit-in began, AEL
personnel were divided on the course of
action the group should take, or the
stand that the students, faculty and
administrators at AEL should assume.
Borison described the early AEL action
as a time when the group, "tried to get
some piece of paper that everybody
could agree on." As the sit-in progressed
however, the issues became more
crystalized, "About Tuesday, people
started writing," Borison said.
Borison's group began a general
distribution of materials from the
McCullough Physics Building. The

information took various forms. One
letter was signed The STL (Systems
Techniques Lab) Graduate Students,
another was signed The AEL
Community and other handouts were
simply titled "The AEL Sit-in" or
"Immoral Acts at AEL."
Contents Varied
The content of the information
varied from detailed statements on the
kinds of research that goes on at AEL,
to single capitalized sentences reading,
"HEART DISEASE PROJECT
STOPPED, PROPOSAL ON AIR
POLLUTION INSTRUMENTATION
STOPPED."
Borison spoke critically of the sit-in
on the grounds that while the eight-day
occupation focused attention on the
issues of classified research and CBW
warfare, all standard means of
communication of these issues had not
been exhausted. "The April 3rd
Coalition said that they were going to
enlighten us at AEL," said Borison,
"But no one ever came to see me to talk
about research at AEL before the sit-in
began."
AEL's Rambo said he wasn't at
liberty to speak on President Pitzer's
order to shut down AEL for a week, but
the chief administrator did say that the
Stanford community was confused

about the AEL building itself, and the
kinds of things that are done at that
facility. "The building has a research
group in it, the STL, but there are also
patent offices, a publications office, a
University Purchasing Office and all of
these people are caught up in the
dispute too."
Scott Borison had some strong words
for Pitzer's move to shut down the Lab.
"Absurd," said Borison. "A lot of us
think that the administration went too
far in dealing with the demonstrators."
Both Rambo and Borison were
concerned about the theft of two
graduate theses from the AEL building.
"To the best of my knowledge, said
Borison, "The final copy of a graduate
thesis and the rough draft of another are
still missing from AEL." Rambo added
that since all AEL personnel are not
allowed to enter the AEL building until
Friday it will be impossible to say what
is missing from the building.
"AEL isn't printing any information
at the present time, but may resume
publication on Friday, depending upon
the events surrounding the re-entrance
to the AEL," Borison said.
"It isn't right that the Coalition says
what we are doing is wrong, and what
they are telling us to do is right," said
Borison.
