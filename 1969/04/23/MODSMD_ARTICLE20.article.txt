# Congressman Speaks
## Meaning Of 'Security' Changed 
### 
"Security and defense now
means the ability lor the United
States to enforce our political will
anywhere in the world,"
according to Democratic
representative George Brown.
Brown, Congressman from the
29th District in Los Angeles,
elaborated on this and other
concepts during an informal talk
yesterday in the Physics Tank.
He said, "We seem to fear that
some fourth-rate power will run
their country the way they want
to run it, instead of the way we
want them to run it." Brown went
on to explain, in response to
questions from the audience, that
there is a type of mentality in
America that views the
military-industrial complex as
"law unto itself." This mentality
is particularly observable in the
current ABM debate.
"Actually, all supporting
arguments for the ABM are
rationalizations by the Joint
Chiefs—they really don't care who
the system is aimed at or even if it
will work." Underlying their
rationalizations, he points out, is
that superweapon systems "tend
to perpetuate the U.S. image as an
undefeatable technological
power."
Technology Insufficient
Unfortunately for the country,
"Wars of national liberation are
not won by technology. The
Pentagon has yet to find this
out."
Brown, who has "never voted a
dollar Tor the Vietnam War" since
he entered Congress in 1962, also

commented on the mood oi
Coligress. He feels "those who are
oriented militarily are still in
power—in both numbers and by
.holding strategic positions." The
committee system tends to stifle
rational, open debate as "only
people who are thought to be
compatible with the structure are
allowed in the key committees."
Asked about Congressional
reaction to such things as the AEL
sit-in, he replied, "The vast
majority think you are scatter
brained idiots, if they want to be
nice to you. The rest think you
are militant anarchists and would
probably support bringing in the
Army to root you out."
Militant Liberal
Since Brown has strong peace
sentiments and is one of the
"militant liberals" of Congress, he
often feels frustrated by the
system. Yet he isn't for its
overthrow and isn't cynical about
the future.
"Sure, the system is really
lousy, but it's the best around. We
can change it, and we might win in
the next ten years."
"For if you have the power to
overthrow this government by
force, you have more than enough
power to overthrow it
peacefully."
On some of the current issues:
He feels the SST will not be
continued at its present level of
funding; that it is not likely
Congress will approve the
Constitutional amendment to
lower the voting age to 18; that
the draft will be continued as is

until at least 1971, and that after
Viet Nam the military budget
won't be substantially reduced.
He is not too critical of the
Nixon administration, pointing
out it is making steps toward
radical revision of the welfare and
tax systems. "A lot of
conservative Democrats and
Republicans are astounded at
what Nixon is doing."
Asked later about the 1970

elections, Congressman Brown
says he is interested in the Senate
race and might run if he had
enough support. He doesn't think
that the current leading contender
for the Democratic nomination,
John Tunney, is "all that far
ahead." Brown expects a clash
between Mayor Alioto of San
Francisco and former Assembly
speaker Jesse Unruh for the
Gubernatorial nomination.

elections, Congressman Brown
says he is interested in the Senate
race and might run if he had
enough support. He doesn't think
that the current leading contender
for the Democratic nomination,
John Tunney, is "all that far
ahead." Brown expects a clash
between Mayor Alioto of San
Francisco and former Assembly
speaker Jesse Unruh for the
Gubernatorial nomination.
"Security and defense now
means the ability lor the United
States to enforce our political will
anywhere in the world,"
according to Democratic
representative George Brown.
Brown, Congressman from the
29th District in Los Angeles,
elaborated on this and other
concepts during an informal talk
yesterday in the Physics Tank.
He said, "We seem to fear that
some fourth-rate power will run
their country the way they want
to run it, instead of the way we
want them to run it." Brown went
on to explain, in response to
questions from the audience, that
there is a type of mentality in
America that views the
military-industrial complex as
"law unto itself." This mentality
is particularly observable in the
current ABM debate.
"Actually, all supporting
arguments for the ABM are
rationalizations by the Joint
Chiefs—they really don't care who
the system is aimed at or even if it
will work." Underlying their
rationalizations, he points out, is
that superweapon systems "tend
to perpetuate the U.S. image as an
undefeatable technological
power."
Technology Insufficient
Unfortunately for the country,
"Wars of national liberation are
not won by technology. The
Pentagon has yet to find this
out."
Brown, who has "never voted a
dollar Tor the Vietnam War" since
he entered Congress in 1962, also

commented on the mood oi
Coligress. He feels "those who are
oriented militarily are still in
power—in both numbers and by
.holding strategic positions." The
committee system tends to stifle
rational, open debate as "only
people who are thought to be
compatible with the structure are
allowed in the key committees."
Asked about Congressional
reaction to such things as the AEL
sit-in, he replied, "The vast
majority think you are scatter
brained idiots, if they want to be
nice to you. The rest think you
are militant anarchists and would
probably support bringing in the
Army to root you out."
Militant Liberal
Since Brown has strong peace
sentiments and is one of the
"militant liberals" of Congress, he
often feels frustrated by the
system. Yet he isn't for its
overthrow and isn't cynical about
the future.
"Sure, the system is really
lousy, but it's the best around. We
can change it, and we might win in
the next ten years."
"For if you have the power to
overthrow this government by
force, you have more than enough
power to overthrow it
peacefully."
On some of the current issues:
He feels the SST will not be
continued at its present level of
funding; that it is not likely
Congress will approve the
Constitutional amendment to
lower the voting age to 18; that
the draft will be continued as is

until at least 1971, and that after
Viet Nam the military budget
won't be substantially reduced.
He is not too critical of the
Nixon administration, pointing
out it is making steps toward
radical revision of the welfare and
tax systems. "A lot of
conservative Democrats and
Republicans are astounded at
what Nixon is doing."
Asked later about the 1970

elections, Congressman Brown
says he is interested in the Senate
race and might run if he had
enough support. He doesn't think
that the current leading contender
for the Democratic nomination,
John Tunney, is "all that far
