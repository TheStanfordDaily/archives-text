# Indians Host Golf Collegiates
## 
### 
Coach Bud Finger's Stanford
golf team will be gunning for its
second straight championship
starting tomorrow when the
Indians host the Second Annual
U.S. Collegiate Invitational Golf
Championships. A strong field of
22 teams will be entered in he
tournament, which will run from
tomorrow through Saturday on
the Stanford links.
Last year the Tribe took home
both the individual and team
titles, as Texan Sandy Adelman
posted a winning, 54-hole total of

214, one over par. Teammate
Rich Harris ran second with a fine
218 score, while freshman Tom
Watson placed third with 219.
Adelman is back this year, but
he may have his hands full in
trying to repeat as individual
champion. Sandy has been
supplanted as No. 1 man on the
team by Watson . . .who has
literally been burning up the
fairways this spring. Watson,
former Missouri state champion as
a prep, was the individual
champion at the Fresno Golf
Classic last month, and paced the
Indians to an easy 36-18 win over
California one week ago.
Stanford co-captain Greg Pitzer
will be another pre-tourney
favorite for the individual
championship. Pitzer and
Adelman have been in a virtual
standoff throughout the current
season in the battle for the No. 2
spot on the team behind Watson.
Forrest Fezler of San Jose City
College, Gary Sanders and Greg
McHatton from USC, Art
McNickle of California and Jack

Sheehan of Oregon are also likely
challengers for the title.
Teamwise, the defending
champion Stanford squad looms
as the favorite, although the
Indians were upset 14-13 by San
Jose State last week. The Spartans
were the runners-up last year,
finishing 12 strokes behind
Stanford at 893. USC, perennial
Pacific-8 champion before
Stanford pulled a major upset and
knocked off the Trojans last year,
will also be a strong contender for
the team trophy. USC recently
finished second in the Western
Intercollegiates behind Arizona
State, a team Stanford outstroked
by 28 points in winning the
Fresno Classic last month. Tribe
coach Finger also considers
Northern Illinois, Seattle
University, Washington, Oregon
and Oregon State as threats in the
team sweepstakes.
Each entrant will field a
six-man team, but only the top
four scores will be counted in
scoring for the championship. The

top four scores will not be
totalled at the end of each day,
but rather at the end of the 54
holes.
In a unique sidelight to the
tournament, Stanford and
California will both hold their
dual meets with USC concurrently
with the 22-team championship,
Cal will battle the Trojans
Thursday, while Stanford will
follow suit Friday. The teams will
not actually play together in an
individual match, but will match
cards at the end of the day to
determine the dual meet victor.
The need arose for this
arrangement because of
scheduling conflicts.

College, Gary Sanders and Greg
McHatton from USC, Art
McNickle of California and Jack

Sheehan of Oregon are also likely
challengers for the title.
Teamwise, the defending
champion Stanford squad looms
as the favorite, although the
Indians were upset 14-13 by San
Jose State last week. The Spartans
were the runners-up last year,
finishing 12 strokes behind
Stanford at 893. USC, perennial
Pacific-8 champion before
Stanford pulled a major upset and
knocked off the Trojans last year,
will also be a strong contender for
the team trophy. USC recently
finished second in the Western
Intercollegiates behind Arizona
State, a team Stanford outstroked
by 28 points in winning the
Fresno Classic last month. Tribe
coach Finger also considers
Northern Illinois, Seattle
University, Washington, Oregon
and Oregon State as threats in the
team sweepstakes.
Each entrant will field a
six-man team, but only the top
four scores will be counted in
scoring for the championship. The

top four scores will not be
totalled at the end of each day,
but rather at the end of the 54
holes.
In a unique sidelight to the
tournament, Stanford and
California will both hold their
dual meets with USC concurrently
with the 22-team championship,
Cal will battle the Trojans
Thursday, while Stanford will
follow suit Friday. The teams will
not actually play together in an
individual match, but will match
cards at the end of the day to
determine the dual meet victor.
The need arose for this
arrangement because of
scheduling conflicts.
Coach Bud Finger's Stanford
golf team will be gunning for its
second straight championship
starting tomorrow when the
Indians host the Second Annual
U.S. Collegiate Invitational Golf
Championships. A strong field of
22 teams will be entered in he
tournament, which will run from
tomorrow through Saturday on
the Stanford links.
Last year the Tribe took home
both the individual and team
titles, as Texan Sandy Adelman
posted a winning, 54-hole total of

214, one over par. Teammate
Rich Harris ran second with a fine
218 score, while freshman Tom
Watson placed third with 219.
Adelman is back this year, but
he may have his hands full in
trying to repeat as individual
champion. Sandy has been
supplanted as No. 1 man on the
team by Watson . . .who has
literally been burning up the
fairways this spring. Watson,
former Missouri state champion as
a prep, was the individual
champion at the Fresno Golf
Classic last month, and paced the
Indians to an easy 36-18 win over
California one week ago.
Stanford co-captain Greg Pitzer
will be another pre-tourney
favorite for the individual
championship. Pitzer and
Adelman have been in a virtual
standoff throughout the current
season in the battle for the No. 2
spot on the team behind Watson.
Forrest Fezler of San Jose City
College, Gary Sanders and Greg
McHatton from USC, Art
McNickle of California and Jack

challengers for the title.
