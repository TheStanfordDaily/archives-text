# Sail Team Fifth
## 
### 
Last weekend in Maryland, the
Stanford sailing team and skipper
Craig McCabe finished fifth in the
sailing equivalent to the NCAA
championships. Senator Edward
M. Kennedy presented the John
F. Kennedy Memorial Cup to
Cornell University to break a two
year Stanford hold on the trophy.
In this eastern competition
which assembles the eleven best
sailing teams in the country,
Stanford still remains the only
school to have won the trophy
twice.
The favored Indians had a
weak first race in the five race
series, but the second heat fround
the Tribe back in the running.
Leading almost the entire way,
they were narrowly beaten by

USC and Navy on the final leg of
the course and finished third.
As the wind picked up for the
third race of the first day's
competition, Stanford wa s off to
a fair start and managed to work
their way through the fleet as the
race progressed. This time as the
final leg approached, the Indians
and Trojans were battling for the
second spot. Stanford gained
revenge by nipping SC this time.
Thus, at the end of the first
day, USC's consistent sailing gave
them the lead, with Yale and
Cornell tied for second. Stanford
was fourth, just one point behind.
The second day started off
with a cold northwest wind that
soon died. In the first race,
Cornell jumped into an early lead,
with Stanford in fourth and USC
holding down sixth. As the wind
died, the Tribe took a wrong tack
away from the shore and the
unpredictable Chesapeake winds
filled in to the west. By the end of
this leg, Stanford found itself in a
frustrating tenth place while the
rivals from USC were pressuring
Cornell for the lead. As the wind?
again shifted, the Trojans were
also caught unaware and dropped
to fifth.
In the final race, the winds
settled down and Stanford sailed a
consistent race for third.
This year's team was composed
of skipper Craig McCabe, first
mate Kim Desenberg, afterguard
Ray Wilde, Larry Rosenzwig,
Jergon Gramkcow, Steve
Richards, and foredeck Andy
Rose, and Rod Calkins.
