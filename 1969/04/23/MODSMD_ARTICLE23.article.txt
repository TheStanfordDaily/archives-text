# Trojans, Bruins To Come
## Big Ones Next For Glovers 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
In a game as brisk as the
weather it was played in, Phil
Keller blanked the Washington
Huskies on three hits yesterday
afternoon to keep Stanford on
top in Pacific-8 baseball. The
Tribe won, 3-0.
Next on tap for Coach Ray
Young's nine are three games
against Southland foes this
weekend. Number-one ranked
USC comes to the Sunken
Diamond for a Friday game, then
UCLA plays here in a Saturday
double-header. The Indians are
currently sharing first place in the
Pac-8 with USC—both teams have
won seven and lost two. California
and UCLA are tied for second.
The story yesterday was Keller,
who lowered his team-leading
earned run average to 0.78 in his
third straight impressive
conference appearance. He struck
out 10 (right on his average) and
didn't give up a hit until Huskie
left fielder Dana Halvorson (who
hit .369 last year) led off* the
seventh with a solid single to

right. Keller now has 57 strike
outs in 46 innings.
The tribe settled it with two
runs in the first off Washington
starter Bill Thompson. First
baseman Mark Marquess led off
the inning with a bunt single,
moved to second on a balk and

stole third. He scored on a single
to right by Chuck Williams.
Williams then stole second and
scored on a single up the middle
by Russ Tweet.
The Tribe's third run came in
the fifth. Mike Ewing led off the
frame with a single to left, stole
second (what else?), went to third
on a force-out, and came home
with a head-fiuit slide and a
mouthful of dirt on a passed ball*.
TRIBE TlDBlTS—Marquess
_ and Ewing each had two
hits . . .Game was played in an
* hour and 50 minutes . . .Strong
wind from center field kept
several drives in the
park .
