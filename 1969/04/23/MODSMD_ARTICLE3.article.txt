# Report Criticized
## SRI Personnel Upset 
### MICHAEL KUHL MARGIE WOLF (Second of two articles) 
Several Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) employees yesterday verified
president Charles Anderson's warning of
wide dissatisfaction in the Institute with
the SRI committee reports.
Researchers called the tone of the
majority and minority
recommendations "Patronizing,"
"Academically arrogant," and

"extremely biased." Although they
differ on recommendations for SRl's
future, virtually all those interviewed
were incensed at the absence of their
views from the committee report.
Most also opposed the proposed
restrictive covenant and imposition of a
review board from outside SRI on
grounds that it violated academic
freedom
William Bredo, director of
development economics, was

particularly insulted by the
Lyman-Scott minority suggestion of
selling SRI. "Their conscience is
apparently assuaged by selling us off,"
he maintained, "the bigger the amount
the better."
One Intelligent Part
"The only thing about the Scott
report that was intelligently written was
the Cleaver-Bauer minority statement,"
commented Lawrence Pinneo from the
life sciences department. "They did
their homework. The other positions
had no documentation."
"The majority report was really quite
stupid to say 'our judgment is right and
yours is wrong," Pinneo said. "I object
to someone else telling us what to do.
The Cleaver-Bauer position is better
because we can get together and reason
together."
Joe Chadwick, program director in
health, continued "We shouldn't be sold
to the highest bidder in the name of
morality." The minority report has
more integrity and unity. At least it's
not counting the blood drop by drop.
'Still Naive'
"But it's still naive about the degree
of change that can be imposed from
outside," he warned. "It's not moral or
realistic or democratic."
Kaye Tomlin, who works on
augmented human research, suggested,
"The tone of the report—especially
Cleaver's minority report—shows a
communications gap. But there are
many valid points that the Institute
should face."
