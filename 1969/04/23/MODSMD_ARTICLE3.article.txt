# Report Criticized
## SRI Personnel Upset 
### MICHAEL KUHL MARGIE WOLF (Second of two articles) 
Several Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) employees yesterday verified
president Charles Anderson's warning of
wide dissatisfaction in the Institute with
the SRI committee reports.
Researchers called the tone of the
majority and minority
recommendations "Patronizing,"
"Academically arrogant," and

"extremely biased." Although they
differ on recommendations for SRl's
future, virtually all those interviewed
were incensed at the absence of their
views from the committee report.
Most also opposed the proposed
restrictive covenant and imposition of a
review board from outside SRI on
grounds that it violated academic
freedom
William Bredo, director of
development economics, was

particularly insulted by the
Lyman-Scott minority suggestion of
selling SRI. "Their conscience is
apparently assuaged by selling us off,"
he maintained, "the bigger the amount
the better."
One Intelligent Part
"The only thing about the Scott
report that was intelligently written was
the Cleaver-Bauer minority statement,"
commented Lawrence Pinneo from the
life sciences department. "They did
their homework. The other positions
had no documentation."
"The majority report was really quite
stupid to say 'our judgment is right and
yours is wrong," Pinneo said. "I object
to someone else telling us what to do.
The Cleaver-Bauer position is better
because we can get together and reason
together."
Joe Chadwick, program director in
health, continued "We shouldn't be sold
to the highest bidder in the name of
morality." The minority report has
more integrity and unity. At least it's
not counting the blood drop by drop.
'Still Naive'
"But it's still naive about the degree
of change that can be imposed from
outside," he warned. "It's not moral or
realistic or democratic."
Kaye Tomlin, who works on
augmented human research, suggested,
"The tone of the report—especially
Cleaver's minority report—shows a
communications gap. But there are
many valid points that the Institute
should face."


PEACE CONGRESSMAN—George Brown, Democratic congressman from Southern
California, spoke yesterday on military spending and war research in America. He has never
voted for a Vietnam appropriations bill in his seven years in Congress. For a coverage of his
talk please turn to page four.
Representatives of SRI,
panelists David Golden and Felix
Smith, emphasized that SRI
employees feel the University is
treating them like "second class
citizens" and disregarding their
right to self-determination. Smith
stated that "priorities are gravely
wrong" and "we [SRI staff] want
to join you in changing the
situation, but we're going to
decide that for ourselves." Golden
stated that SRI would "not
survive under any of the three
alternatives" of the Scott Report.
The consensus ol the panel
seemed to be that "hope for a
viable relationship" between
Stanford and SRI exists, but there
will have to be a "joint effort" to
find workable solutions.
As Doron Weinberg stated,
"when we commit ourselves to
retain SRI, we accept
responsibility for the problems
involved." He declared that we
must "reorient SRI, with
participation of the employees,"
to affect some "change in our
priorities to help the people of the
world."

Calling the alternative of sale
of SRI with a restrictive covenant
a "seductive . . . unrealistic
illusion," he warned that "we
can't put down legally and in
precise terms what we would like
to restrict or prohibit."
Ivory Power
"Ivory power" was Victor
Hori's interpretation of the April
3 Movement's demand for a
commitment from the
University. He called for a
purification of the University, and
a return to the "ivory tower"
concept. "Forces to repress a
pro-revolutionary university" are
gaining strength, and to be able to
withstand these forces, the
university must be "intellectually
and financially independent," said
Hori.
Several speakers made the
point that although Stanford and
SRI share the same Board of
Directors, there is "grave doubt"
as to whether this joint board
authorizes the University to sell
SRI. The issue was raised that
even if Stanford decided to sell
SRI, it might not be legally
feasible.

alternatives" of the Scott Report.
The consensus ol the panel
seemed to be that "hope for a
viable relationship" between
Stanford and SRI exists, but there
will have to be a "joint effort" to
find workable solutions.
As Doron Weinberg stated,
"when we commit ourselves to
retain SRI, we accept
responsibility for the problems
involved." He declared that we
must "reorient SRI, with
participation of the employees,"
to affect some "change in our
priorities to help the people of the
world."

Calling the alternative of sale
of SRI with a restrictive covenant
a "seductive . . . unrealistic
illusion," he warned that "we
can't put down legally and in
precise terms what we would like
to restrict or prohibit."
Ivory Power
"Ivory power" was Victor
Hori's interpretation of the April
3 Movement's demand for a
commitment from the
University. He called for a
purification of the University, and
a return to the "ivory tower"
concept. "Forces to repress a
pro-revolutionary university" are
gaining strength, and to be able to
withstand these forces, the
university must be "intellectually
and financially independent," said
Hori.
Several speakers made the
point that although Stanford and
SRI share the same Board of
Directors, there is "grave doubt"
as to whether this joint board
authorizes the University to sell
SRI. The issue was raised that
even if Stanford decided to sell
SRI, it might not be legally
feasible.
Several Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) employees yesterday verified
president Charles Anderson's warning of
wide dissatisfaction in the Institute with
the SRI committee reports.
Researchers called the tone of the
majority and minority
recommendations "Patronizing,"
"Academically arrogant," and

"extremely biased." Although they
differ on recommendations for SRl's
future, virtually all those interviewed
were incensed at the absence of their
views from the committee report.
Most also opposed the proposed
restrictive covenant and imposition of a
review board from outside SRI on
grounds that it violated academic
freedom
William Bredo, director of
development economics, was

particularly insulted by the
Lyman-Scott minority suggestion of
selling SRI. "Their conscience is
apparently assuaged by selling us off,"
he maintained, "the bigger the amount
the better."
One Intelligent Part
"The only thing about the Scott
report that was intelligently written was
the Cleaver-Bauer minority statement,"
commented Lawrence Pinneo from the
life sciences department. "They did
their homework. The other positions
had no documentation."
"The majority report was really quite
stupid to say 'our judgment is right and
yours is wrong," Pinneo said. "I object
to someone else telling us what to do.
The Cleaver-Bauer position is better
because we can get together and reason
together."
Joe Chadwick, program director in
health, continued "We shouldn't be sold
to the highest bidder in the name of
morality." The minority report has
more integrity and unity. At least it's
not counting the blood drop by drop.
'Still Naive'
"But it's still naive about the degree
of change that can be imposed from
outside," he warned. "It's not moral or
realistic or democratic."
Kaye Tomlin, who works on
augmented human research, suggested,
"The tone of the report—especially
Cleaver's minority report—shows a
communications gap. But there are
many valid points that the Institute
should face."


PEACE CONGRESSMAN—George Brown, Democratic congressman from Southern
California, spoke yesterday on military spending and war research in America. He has never
voted for a Vietnam appropriations bill in his seven years in Congress. For a coverage of his
talk please turn to page four.
Representatives of SRI,
panelists David Golden and Felix
Smith, emphasized that SRI
employees feel the University is
treating them like "second class
citizens" and disregarding their
right to self-determination. Smith
stated that "priorities are gravely
wrong" and "we [SRI staff] want
to join you in changing the
situation, but we're going to
decide that for ourselves." Golden
stated that SRI would "not
survive under any of the three
alternatives" of the Scott Report.
