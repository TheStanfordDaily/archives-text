# Senate Adjourns, No SRI Decision
## 
### 
Following a three-hour meeting the
Academic Senate adjourned last evening
after failing to reach any decision on the
SRI Committee Report. They voted to
hold another meeting on the same topic
next Tuesday.
The Senate will also meet tomorrow
to discuss, and possibly vote on, the
issue of classified research on the
Stanford campus.
Yesterday's meeting heard from
members of the SRI Committee, SRI
President Charles Anderson and Lincoln
Malik of Stanford's Third World
Liberation Front (TWLF).
Anderson told the Senate that the
overwhelming majority of SRl's 1500
professional staff say they will walk out
"if some outside morals committee is
set up to tell them what is and what is
not morally acceptable in the search for
knowledge."
"Appalled"
Concerning the SRI Committee
report in general Anderson said, that a
vast majority of SRl's employees were
"appalled and incredulous that its
recommendations could be taken
seriously." (See story this page on other
reactions of SRI employees.)
TWLF leader Malik, in prepared
remarks before the Senate, said, "Since
the facade of American foreign policy
has started to fall, an increasing number
of Americans have begun to hear the
voice of the people of the Third World.
This has contributed to the
realization of America.s brutal role in
the exploitation and murder of people
of the Third World and People of color
in the U.S.
"A wave of questioning and

challenging of the basic institutions of
this country has set forth, and the
universities have been in the forefront
of this challenge . . .
Not Neutral
"You have not been neutral in the
past nor can you stay neutral now," he
added. "In the past your research and
expertise has served the enemies of our
people. You are now asked to reverse
your position and come out with zeal
and dedication in favor of the struggle
we are waging because it is the only way
if we are to survive and shape a human
society on this planet.
"To vote for serverance of SRI rather
than more control by the University can
only be a vote for perpetrating the
violence in the Third World . . .
"Come out in simple and direct
terms and proclaim that
counter-insurgency work, war research,
classified research, poison and germ
warfare research are against the policy
of this University faculty and will not
be allowed in any shape or form.
"These are the immediate demands.
But that is not where it will end. The
involvement of the University in the
cruel state of affairs is deeper than that.
You, the faculty of this University, will
have to start thinking of changing more
basic concepts of the whole idea of
teaching and research on this campus."
The April 3rd Movement has planned a
general meeting for Friday noon at the
courtyard of the AliL.
The agenda will include deciding whether
demands concerning AEL have been met, and
deciding the best format for die open hearing
with the trustees next week.
