# More Housing Units Needed, Vote Shows
## 
### 
By a nearly four to one margin,
students in last week's referendum
voted that the University should provide
400 new residence spaces on campus. In
spite of the "troubled financial state of
the university" referred to on the ballot,
students voted overwhelmingly that the
University expand the present living
facilities. They approved a raise in room
charges in order to avoid overcrowding
by creating spaces for students.
While a slim majority advocated that
the University provide more housing for
its graduate students, over a five to one
margin disapproved of doing so at the
expense of undergraduates' living
accomodations.
Transfer students were voted the
same priority as entering freshmen for
University housing. Meanwhile, the
student vote recommended that new
graduate students be the primary
concern of the University in allocating
its limited number of graduate student
spaces.
Foreign Students
Advocating more interaction of
foreign students with the community,
the vote affirmed that at least one
foreign student should be assigned to
each living group. The question of
quaranteeing foreign students on- or
off-campus housing upon admission
passed by a five to one vote.

On the question of more valuable
living experiences for freshmen,
students voted two to one that
integrated housing of all four
undergraduate classes provided a better
experience. The same margin approved
of more co-ed houses for next year.
The actual count on the question of
whether the University should provide
400 new residence spaces was 2674 in
favor, and 691 against. Even more
emphatic was the no vote on whether
there should be more crowding in
undergraduate residences, which totaled
2963 against, with only 363 in favor.
Room Charges
Those willing to see their room
charges raised $10 to $15 to help pay
for the housing increase numbered
1735, as compared to 492 who were
unwilling to pay additional fees.
Barry Askinas, chairman of the
Graduate Student Association and
organizer of the housing referendum,
said that he "was generally pleased with
the results. Students clearly feel that the
University can afford more housing
construction now and are willing to tax
themselves to help accomplish it."
"They are also concerned enough
about foreign graduate students to
invite them to live in undergraduate
residences, and think that they should
be guaranteed housing as part of
admission."

charges raised $10 to $15 to help pay
for the housing increase numbered
1735, as compared to 492 who were
unwilling to pay additional fees.
Barry Askinas, chairman of the
Graduate Student Association and
organizer of the housing referendum,
said that he "was generally pleased with
the results. Students clearly feel that the
University can afford more housing
construction now and are willing to tax
themselves to help accomplish it."
"They are also concerned enough
about foreign graduate students to
invite them to live in undergraduate
residences, and think that they should
be guaranteed housing as part of
admission."
