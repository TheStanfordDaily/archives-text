# McAffee Brown Speech Highlights 'Day Of Concern'
## 
### HANK LIESE FELICITY BARRINGER EILEEN HALEY BILL BANKS KIT CAMERON 
In an enthusiastically received speech in one
of yesterday's 'Day of Concern' panel
discussions noted theologian Robert McAffee
Brown called for placing "human freedom"
above academic freedom.
"I am convinced that we must face the
possibility of some limitations on 'academic
freedom' in the name of human
freedom—freedom for men to survive," Brown
said.
"It is not the task of a university to traffic in
death," he continued, "or to do anything that
will enhance the power of men to destroy one
another.
"I am left no alternative but to urge that the
university and SRI find ways to redirect their
research from war-directed to peace-directed
research, no matter how complex will be the
problem of differentiating those two directions
on specific contracts."
Concluding Statement
Brown's concluding statement received a
standing ovation: "So let me say this to
Professor Rambo and his colleagues at AEL:
if the phasing out of war-research loses you
valuable contracts, and this diminishes the
resources you have to continue the important
research you are already doing in other areas, I
pledge myself, and will urge my colleagues to
pledge, that we take whatever salary cuts are
necessary in order to help make up that loss, so
that your expertise, and that of all the other
research scientists at this university, can be put
to work in fully creative directions that will
help you fashion the kind of world we all
want."
Earlier in the same discussion Paul Bernstein,
a graduate student in political science warned,
"TTie human race as a whole has a half-life of
between ten and twenty years." Bernstein was
moderator of the panel discussion on
"War-Related Research: Stanford and SRI."
"This means," Bernstein told an overflow
crowd in Tresidder's large lounge, "that 50
percent of us have a chance of being alive 10 to
20 years from now."

science and a member of SDS and the April 3

"You not only have to be a moral pigmy to
be engaged in biological warfare research, you
have to be a moron on top of it," remarked
Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb
and a biology professor at Stanford, at a panel
discussion held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday morning.
The statement was heavily applauded.
The discussion, attended by over 500
people, focused on the issue of war-related
research at Stanford and the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI). Victor von Schlegell,
vice-president of the ASSU, served as
moderator.
Ehrlich stated that he agreed with the
concerns of the recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, but emphasized the

Morality

importance of not changing the role of the
University as a tool for change. "It would be a
selfish thing to destroy our effectiveness around
the world for the fulfillment of our immediate
moral concerns," he noted.
Efficacy of Action
Panelist Steve Weissman, replying to
Ehrlich's argument, explained that he had a
firm belief in the effectiveness of action. He
asked if the failure to employ any means would
insure that the desired ends would not be
brought about. "We have to make a choice. Wo
must choose a means," Weissman said.
Harvey Hukari, President of the Young
Americans for Freedom, (YAF) prefaces his
remarks by saying that he was in the position of
being a "devil's advocate. There has been an
effort to place a political issue in a moral
context. It is heresy to speak against morality."
He went on to reject the idea of
institutionalized morality.
"I am delighted that the April 3rd Coalition
brought, the issue to the minds of professors
who might otherwise not have thought of it,"
Huknri stated. He added, however, that he
disagreed strongly with both the goals and the
tactics of the movement.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the
alternatives open to both the university and
SRI, a panel of students, faculty, and SRI
researchers discussed "Stanford and SRI:
Towards a Viable Relationship" before a full
auditorium in Cubberlev vesterdav afternoon.

Stanford^Sßl

Moderated by Michael Menke, SLAC physicist,
the two hour discussion marked the conclusion
of the ASSU-sponsored "Day of Concern."
Labelling the Scott Report on SRI
"unimaginative," Roulette Smith, one of the
panelists, suggested converting SRI into a
research university along the lines of
Rockefeller Institute. His tentative proposal
urged that SRI be a separate entity with a
distinct administration, but that its faculty have
equal responsibility in determining research
policy. He advocated that faculty hold joint
membership in each institution.

"Counterinsurgency: At Home and Abroad"
was the concern of a seven man panel in front
of more than five hundred students in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The two-hour panel was moderated by
Barton Bernstein, Associate Professor of
History. Panel members were Harry Cleaver, a
graduate student in Economics and co-author
of one SRI committee minority report, Gordon
Wiley, Executive director of Systems Analysis
at SRI, John Lewis, professor in Political
Science, Robert Textor an Education and
Anthropology Professor, Pedro Albarracin an
undergraduate student from Columbia, and
Harty Frye, of the Berkeley Sociology
Department.

CI Warfare

Cleaver opened the discussion with a
definition of counterinsurgency. Quoting from
a military dictionary, he emphasized the wide
range of activities that fall within the military's
definition of counterinsurgency.
Admitted Work
Wiley then opened with the remark, "I am
involved in counterinsurgency work. I do not
deny it." After taking a short breath to deny
Cleaver's allegation that Jesse Hobson had ever
been president of United Fruit Co., Wiley
expanded on his opening statement, saying that
he has reached his own moral decisions about
the work he is doing.
Having worked in Thailand in the capacity
of an Anthropologist, Robert Texter opened
saying, "Had there been more scholarship in
studies of Thailand in the late '4 o's and
throughout the 1950'5, it is conceivable that
the Americans would have been aware of the
situation and that this international crime
would have been obviated."
TWLF Member
Pedro Albarracin, a Columbian and member
of the Third World Liberation Front then
spoke. He said that despite the American habit
of labeling all uprisings "communist," he and
his fellow students were fighting for liberty.

Classified research received mixed support in
yesterday morning's panel discussion on
Classified Research.
Professors H. Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Leonard
Schiff, Physics; William Baxter, Law; Associate
Professor Michael Arbib, Electrical Engineering
and Research Associate Lee Herzenberg of the

Secrecy

Medical School spoke before a crowd which
overflowed into the small lounge. Robert Jaafe,
graduate student in Physics, acted as moderator
for the group.
Each speaker was asked to give a five-minute
presentation, relating the importance of
classification of research, and whether such
declassification of projects infringes on the
researcher's individual academic freedom.
Baxter Support
Professor Baxter was the only speaker who
spoke definitely in favor of classified research,
maintaining that declassification places external
pressure upon the researcher involved: in effect
that "the needs of society override the
individual's research." Prof. Baxter likened the
present situation to the Anti-Darwinism of the
Thirties; society was frightened by the
implications of the work being done and
attempts to place moral judgements, which
later proved false, were made upon it.
Strongly opposed to Prof. Baxter were Lee
Herzenberg, the only woman on the panel, and
Associate Professor Michael Arbib, who
retaliated against Prof. Baxter's analogy with a
quotation from Shaw: No matter what one may
learn about the effect of high temperatures on
humans, one still does not have the right to put
one's mother-in-law in the oven . . . His remarks
drew laughter and applause.
Speakers Noyes, Pettit, and Schiff presented
more moderate views. Professor Schiff
suggested that openness of research take
precedence over a researcher's individual right
for secrecy. A university, he said, is a place for
academic give and take, a center for learning
and discussion.
Movement, started things off with
a brief history of the development
of Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and the military research
carried on there.
Shoch focused on counter
insurgency research at SRI,
concluding that "SRI has been
signigicantly and importantly
involved in counterinsurgency
research directed against members
of the Third World in Southeast
Asia and Latin America.
"SRI or Stanford has no right
to be complicit in any operations
and research determining the
future of these people."
Continuing the discussion on

research at SRI was Bonnar Cox,
assistant executive director of the
Information Sciences and
Engineering Div. at SRI.
Cox personally feels that "SRI
must be responsive to all public
agencies, not exclusive of the
federal government, to do
research that is legally permitted
and for which SRI has a clear
demonstrable competence or
capability.
Objecting to "any implication
as to the moral deficiency of the
SRI community," Cox continued,
"I submit that our researchers
meet an obligation both to
themselves and the world at large
by constantly considering moral
and ethical issues as related to the
research they carry out."
Matthew Sands, a professor
and deputy director at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator,
concerned himself with value
judgments on war-related
research, stating that there is "a
morality, an ethic, to research and
scholarship."
Sands concluded, "We must
find some mechanism for facing
and making collective agreement
on the issues." Although he
believes value judgments won't be
universal, Sands still feels some
sort of consensus can be reached.
William Rambo, director of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
attempted to extend Sands' ideas
by investigating possible criteria
for defining "war-related
research."
Rambo fears "an automatic
acceptance by this community
without argument or individual
thought, of an association of the
term with evil—and a consequent
unacceptability of certain research
in consequence."

Chadwick, however, cautioned,
"There is a definite limit of
change that can be accomplished
short of tearing SRI down. The
report is completely polarized and
presents impossible extreme
solutions."
Some employees questionned
the content as well as the form of
challenges to SRl's present
position.
Bredo said he felt, "We should
be engaged in studies concerned
with the security of the United
States and its allies. We should be
free as an institution to make this
choice. This is not necessarily
warfare," he explained, "It is
helping the government of the
United States make better
decision."
Howard Vollmer, a senior
sociologist, explained how defense
work can change government
policy: "The way a client defines

a problem is often superficial. In
our research we try to get at the
root causes that he has. This is
why many of the people military
or defense projects are convinced
their work has a significant effect
in modifying defense policies,
often in reducing the level of
military activity.
"These people feel that if they
were prohibited from working on
these kinds of projects, that the
military authorities would have to
turn to incompetent people to do
some of their research and would
therefore not have the advantage
of insights and scientific that we
can provide."
SRI administrator Rudolf
Brunsvold pinpointed the SRI
dilemma Monday, noting that all
proposed alternatives seem
financially and philosophically
objectionable to many of the SRI
staff, and the status quo seems
intolerable to other concerned
groups.

meet an obligation both to
themselves and the world at large
by constantly considering moral
and ethical issues as related to the
research they carry out."
Matthew Sands, a professor
and deputy director at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator,
concerned himself with value
judgments on war-related
research, stating that there is "a
morality, an ethic, to research and
scholarship."
Sands concluded, "We must
find some mechanism for facing
and making collective agreement
on the issues." Although he
believes value judgments won't be
universal, Sands still feels some
sort of consensus can be reached.
William Rambo, director of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
attempted to extend Sands' ideas
by investigating possible criteria
for defining "war-related
research."
Rambo fears "an automatic
acceptance by this community
without argument or individual
thought, of an association of the
term with evil—and a consequent
unacceptability of certain research
in consequence."

Chadwick, however, cautioned,
"There is a definite limit of
change that can be accomplished
short of tearing SRI down. The
report is completely polarized and
presents impossible extreme
solutions."
Some employees questionned
the content as well as the form of
challenges to SRl's present
position.
Bredo said he felt, "We should
be engaged in studies concerned
with the security of the United
States and its allies. We should be
free as an institution to make this
choice. This is not necessarily
warfare," he explained, "It is
helping the government of the
United States make better
decision."
Howard Vollmer, a senior
sociologist, explained how defense
work can change government
policy: "The way a client defines

a problem is often superficial. In
our research we try to get at the
root causes that he has. This is
why many of the people military
or defense projects are convinced
their work has a significant effect
in modifying defense policies,
often in reducing the level of
military activity.
"These people feel that if they
were prohibited from working on
these kinds of projects, that the
military authorities would have to
turn to incompetent people to do
some of their research and would
therefore not have the advantage
of insights and scientific that we
can provide."
SRI administrator Rudolf
Brunsvold pinpointed the SRI
dilemma Monday, noting that all
proposed alternatives seem
financially and philosophically
objectionable to many of the SRI
staff, and the status quo seems
intolerable to other concerned
groups.
In an enthusiastically received speech in one
of yesterday's 'Day of Concern' panel
discussions noted theologian Robert McAffee
Brown called for placing "human freedom"
above academic freedom.
"I am convinced that we must face the
possibility of some limitations on 'academic
freedom' in the name of human
freedom—freedom for men to survive," Brown
said.
"It is not the task of a university to traffic in
death," he continued, "or to do anything that
will enhance the power of men to destroy one
another.
"I am left no alternative but to urge that the
university and SRI find ways to redirect their
research from war-directed to peace-directed
research, no matter how complex will be the
problem of differentiating those two directions
on specific contracts."
Concluding Statement
Brown's concluding statement received a
standing ovation: "So let me say this to
Professor Rambo and his colleagues at AEL:
if the phasing out of war-research loses you
valuable contracts, and this diminishes the
resources you have to continue the important
research you are already doing in other areas, I
pledge myself, and will urge my colleagues to
pledge, that we take whatever salary cuts are
necessary in order to help make up that loss, so
that your expertise, and that of all the other
research scientists at this university, can be put
to work in fully creative directions that will
help you fashion the kind of world we all
want."
Earlier in the same discussion Paul Bernstein,
a graduate student in political science warned,
"TTie human race as a whole has a half-life of
between ten and twenty years." Bernstein was
moderator of the panel discussion on
"War-Related Research: Stanford and SRI."
"This means," Bernstein told an overflow
crowd in Tresidder's large lounge, "that 50
percent of us have a chance of being alive 10 to
20 years from now."

science and a member of SDS and the April 3

"You not only have to be a moral pigmy to
be engaged in biological warfare research, you
have to be a moron on top of it," remarked
Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb
and a biology professor at Stanford, at a panel
discussion held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday morning.
The statement was heavily applauded.
The discussion, attended by over 500
people, focused on the issue of war-related
research at Stanford and the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI). Victor von Schlegell,
vice-president of the ASSU, served as
moderator.
Ehrlich stated that he agreed with the
concerns of the recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, but emphasized the

Morality

importance of not changing the role of the
University as a tool for change. "It would be a
selfish thing to destroy our effectiveness around
the world for the fulfillment of our immediate
moral concerns," he noted.
Efficacy of Action
Panelist Steve Weissman, replying to
Ehrlich's argument, explained that he had a
firm belief in the effectiveness of action. He
asked if the failure to employ any means would
insure that the desired ends would not be
brought about. "We have to make a choice. Wo
must choose a means," Weissman said.
Harvey Hukari, President of the Young
Americans for Freedom, (YAF) prefaces his
remarks by saying that he was in the position of
being a "devil's advocate. There has been an
effort to place a political issue in a moral
context. It is heresy to speak against morality."
He went on to reject the idea of
institutionalized morality.
"I am delighted that the April 3rd Coalition
brought, the issue to the minds of professors
who might otherwise not have thought of it,"
Huknri stated. He added, however, that he
disagreed strongly with both the goals and the
tactics of the movement.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the
alternatives open to both the university and
SRI, a panel of students, faculty, and SRI
researchers discussed "Stanford and SRI:
Towards a Viable Relationship" before a full
auditorium in Cubberlev vesterdav afternoon.

Stanford^Sßl

Moderated by Michael Menke, SLAC physicist,
the two hour discussion marked the conclusion
of the ASSU-sponsored "Day of Concern."
Labelling the Scott Report on SRI
"unimaginative," Roulette Smith, one of the
panelists, suggested converting SRI into a
research university along the lines of
Rockefeller Institute. His tentative proposal
urged that SRI be a separate entity with a
distinct administration, but that its faculty have
equal responsibility in determining research
policy. He advocated that faculty hold joint
membership in each institution.

"Counterinsurgency: At Home and Abroad"
was the concern of a seven man panel in front
of more than five hundred students in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The two-hour panel was moderated by
Barton Bernstein, Associate Professor of
History. Panel members were Harry Cleaver, a
graduate student in Economics and co-author
of one SRI committee minority report, Gordon
Wiley, Executive director of Systems Analysis
at SRI, John Lewis, professor in Political
Science, Robert Textor an Education and
Anthropology Professor, Pedro Albarracin an
undergraduate student from Columbia, and
Harty Frye, of the Berkeley Sociology
Department.

CI Warfare

Cleaver opened the discussion with a
definition of counterinsurgency. Quoting from
a military dictionary, he emphasized the wide
range of activities that fall within the military's
definition of counterinsurgency.
Admitted Work
Wiley then opened with the remark, "I am
involved in counterinsurgency work. I do not
deny it." After taking a short breath to deny
Cleaver's allegation that Jesse Hobson had ever
been president of United Fruit Co., Wiley
expanded on his opening statement, saying that
he has reached his own moral decisions about
the work he is doing.
Having worked in Thailand in the capacity
of an Anthropologist, Robert Texter opened
saying, "Had there been more scholarship in
studies of Thailand in the late '4 o's and
throughout the 1950'5, it is conceivable that
the Americans would have been aware of the
situation and that this international crime
would have been obviated."
TWLF Member
Pedro Albarracin, a Columbian and member
of the Third World Liberation Front then
spoke. He said that despite the American habit
of labeling all uprisings "communist," he and
his fellow students were fighting for liberty.

Classified research received mixed support in
yesterday morning's panel discussion on
Classified Research.
Professors H. Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Leonard
Schiff, Physics; William Baxter, Law; Associate
Professor Michael Arbib, Electrical Engineering
and Research Associate Lee Herzenberg of the

Secrecy

Medical School spoke before a crowd which
overflowed into the small lounge. Robert Jaafe,
graduate student in Physics, acted as moderator
for the group.
Each speaker was asked to give a five-minute
presentation, relating the importance of
classification of research, and whether such
declassification of projects infringes on the
researcher's individual academic freedom.
Baxter Support
Professor Baxter was the only speaker who
spoke definitely in favor of classified research,
maintaining that declassification places external
pressure upon the researcher involved: in effect
that "the needs of society override the
individual's research." Prof. Baxter likened the
present situation to the Anti-Darwinism of the
Thirties; society was frightened by the
implications of the work being done and
attempts to place moral judgements, which
later proved false, were made upon it.
Strongly opposed to Prof. Baxter were Lee
Herzenberg, the only woman on the panel, and
Associate Professor Michael Arbib, who
retaliated against Prof. Baxter's analogy with a
quotation from Shaw: No matter what one may
learn about the effect of high temperatures on
humans, one still does not have the right to put
one's mother-in-law in the oven . . . His remarks
drew laughter and applause.
Speakers Noyes, Pettit, and Schiff presented
more moderate views. Professor Schiff
suggested that openness of research take
precedence over a researcher's individual right
for secrecy. A university, he said, is a place for
academic give and take, a center for learning
and discussion.
Movement, started things off with
a brief history of the development
of Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and the military research
carried on there.
Shoch focused on counter
insurgency research at SRI,
concluding that "SRI has been
signigicantly and importantly
involved in counterinsurgency
research directed against members
of the Third World in Southeast
Asia and Latin America.
"SRI or Stanford has no right
to be complicit in any operations
and research determining the
future of these people."
Continuing the discussion on

research at SRI was Bonnar Cox,
assistant executive director of the
Information Sciences and
Engineering Div. at SRI.
Cox personally feels that "SRI
must be responsive to all public
agencies, not exclusive of the
federal government, to do
research that is legally permitted
and for which SRI has a clear
demonstrable competence or
capability.
Objecting to "any implication
as to the moral deficiency of the
SRI community," Cox continued,
"I submit that our researchers
meet an obligation both to
themselves and the world at large
by constantly considering moral
and ethical issues as related to the
research they carry out."
Matthew Sands, a professor
and deputy director at the

for the group.
Each speaker was asked to give a five-minute
presentation, relating the importance of
classification of research, and whether such
declassification of projects infringes on the
researcher's individual academic freedom.
Baxter Support
Professor Baxter was the only speaker who
spoke definitely in favor of classified research,
maintaining that declassification places external
pressure upon the researcher involved: in effect
that "the needs of society override the
individual's research." Prof. Baxter likened the
present situation to the Anti-Darwinism of the
Thirties; society was frightened by the
implications of the work being done and
attempts to place moral judgements, which
later proved false, were made upon it.
Strongly opposed to Prof. Baxter were Lee
Herzenberg, the only woman on the panel, and
Associate Professor Michael Arbib, who
retaliated against Prof. Baxter's analogy with a
quotation from Shaw: No matter what one may
learn about the effect of high temperatures on
humans, one still does not have the right to put
one's mother-in-law in the oven . . . His remarks
drew laughter and applause.
Speakers Noyes, Pettit, and Schiff presented
more moderate views. Professor Schiff
suggested that openness of research take
precedence over a researcher's individual right
for secrecy. A university, he said, is a place for
academic give and take, a center for learning
and discussion.
Movement, started things off with
a brief history of the development
of Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and the military research
carried on there.
Shoch focused on counter
insurgency research at SRI,
concluding that "SRI has been
signigicantly and importantly
involved in counterinsurgency
research directed against members
of the Third World in Southeast
Asia and Latin America.
"SRI or Stanford has no right
to be complicit in any operations
and research determining the
future of these people."
Continuing the discussion on

research at SRI was Bonnar Cox,
assistant executive director of the
Information Sciences and
Engineering Div. at SRI.
Cox personally feels that "SRI
must be responsive to all public
agencies, not exclusive of the
federal government, to do
research that is legally permitted
and for which SRI has a clear
demonstrable competence or
capability.
Objecting to "any implication
as to the moral deficiency of the
SRI community," Cox continued,
"I submit that our researchers
meet an obligation both to
themselves and the world at large
by constantly considering moral
and ethical issues as related to the
research they carry out."
Matthew Sands, a professor
and deputy director at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator,
concerned himself with value
judgments on war-related
research, stating that there is "a
morality, an ethic, to research and
scholarship."
Sands concluded, "We must
find some mechanism for facing
and making collective agreement
on the issues." Although he
believes value judgments won't be
universal, Sands still feels some
sort of consensus can be reached.
William Rambo, director of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
attempted to extend Sands' ideas
by investigating possible criteria
for defining "war-related
research."
Rambo fears "an automatic
acceptance by this community
without argument or individual
thought, of an association of the
term with evil—and a consequent
unacceptability of certain research
in consequence."

Chadwick, however, cautioned,
"There is a definite limit of
change that can be accomplished
short of tearing SRI down. The
report is completely polarized and
presents impossible extreme
solutions."
Some employees questionned
the content as well as the form of
challenges to SRl's present
position.
Bredo said he felt, "We should
be engaged in studies concerned
with the security of the United
States and its allies. We should be
free as an institution to make this
choice. This is not necessarily
warfare," he explained, "It is
helping the government of the
United States make better
decision."
Howard Vollmer, a senior
sociologist, explained how defense
work can change government
policy: "The way a client defines

a problem is often superficial. In
our research we try to get at the
root causes that he has. This is
why many of the people military
or defense projects are convinced
their work has a significant effect
in modifying defense policies,
often in reducing the level of
military activity.
"These people feel that if they
were prohibited from working on
these kinds of projects, that the
military authorities would have to
turn to incompetent people to do
some of their research and would
therefore not have the advantage
of insights and scientific that we
can provide."
SRI administrator Rudolf
Brunsvold pinpointed the SRI
dilemma Monday, noting that all
proposed alternatives seem
financially and philosophically
objectionable to many of the SRI
staff, and the status quo seems
intolerable to other concerned
groups.
In an enthusiastically received speech in one
of yesterday's 'Day of Concern' panel
discussions noted theologian Robert McAffee
Brown called for placing "human freedom"
above academic freedom.
"I am convinced that we must face the
possibility of some limitations on 'academic
freedom' in the name of human
freedom—freedom for men to survive," Brown
said.
"It is not the task of a university to traffic in
death," he continued, "or to do anything that
will enhance the power of men to destroy one
another.
"I am left no alternative but to urge that the
university and SRI find ways to redirect their
research from war-directed to peace-directed
research, no matter how complex will be the
problem of differentiating those two directions
on specific contracts."
Concluding Statement
Brown's concluding statement received a
standing ovation: "So let me say this to
Professor Rambo and his colleagues at AEL:
if the phasing out of war-research loses you
valuable contracts, and this diminishes the
resources you have to continue the important
research you are already doing in other areas, I
pledge myself, and will urge my colleagues to
pledge, that we take whatever salary cuts are
necessary in order to help make up that loss, so
that your expertise, and that of all the other
research scientists at this university, can be put
to work in fully creative directions that will
help you fashion the kind of world we all
want."
Earlier in the same discussion Paul Bernstein,
a graduate student in political science warned,
"TTie human race as a whole has a half-life of
between ten and twenty years." Bernstein was
moderator of the panel discussion on
"War-Related Research: Stanford and SRI."
"This means," Bernstein told an overflow
crowd in Tresidder's large lounge, "that 50
percent of us have a chance of being alive 10 to
20 years from now."
James Shoch, an undergraduate in political
science and a member of SDS and the April 3

"You not only have to be a moral pigmy to
be engaged in biological warfare research, you
have to be a moron on top of it," remarked
Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb
and a biology professor at Stanford, at a panel
discussion held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday morning.
The statement was heavily applauded.
The discussion, attended by over 500
people, focused on the issue of war-related
research at Stanford and the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI). Victor von Schlegell,
vice-president of the ASSU, served as
moderator.
Ehrlich stated that he agreed with the
concerns of the recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, but emphasized the

Morality

importance of not changing the role of the
University as a tool for change. "It would be a
selfish thing to destroy our effectiveness around
the world for the fulfillment of our immediate
moral concerns," he noted.
Efficacy of Action
Panelist Steve Weissman, replying to
Ehrlich's argument, explained that he had a
firm belief in the effectiveness of action. He
asked if the failure to employ any means would
insure that the desired ends would not be
brought about. "We have to make a choice. Wo
must choose a means," Weissman said.
Harvey Hukari, President of the Young
Americans for Freedom, (YAF) prefaces his
remarks by saying that he was in the position of
being a "devil's advocate. There has been an
effort to place a political issue in a moral
context. It is heresy to speak against morality."
He went on to reject the idea of
institutionalized morality.
"I am delighted that the April 3rd Coalition
brought, the issue to the minds of professors
who might otherwise not have thought of it,"
Huknri stated. He added, however, that he
disagreed strongly with both the goals and the
tactics of the movement.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the
alternatives open to both the university and
SRI, a panel of students, faculty, and SRI
researchers discussed "Stanford and SRI:
Towards a Viable Relationship" before a full
auditorium in Cubberlev vesterdav afternoon.

Stanford^Sßl

Moderated by Michael Menke, SLAC physicist,
the two hour discussion marked the conclusion
of the ASSU-sponsored "Day of Concern."
Labelling the Scott Report on SRI
"unimaginative," Roulette Smith, one of the
panelists, suggested converting SRI into a
research university along the lines of
Rockefeller Institute. His tentative proposal
urged that SRI be a separate entity with a
distinct administration, but that its faculty have
equal responsibility in determining research
policy. He advocated that faculty hold joint
membership in each institution.

"Counterinsurgency: At Home and Abroad"
was the concern of a seven man panel in front
of more than five hundred students in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The two-hour panel was moderated by
Barton Bernstein, Associate Professor of
History. Panel members were Harry Cleaver, a
graduate student in Economics and co-author
of one SRI committee minority report, Gordon
Wiley, Executive director of Systems Analysis
at SRI, John Lewis, professor in Political
Science, Robert Textor an Education and
Anthropology Professor, Pedro Albarracin an
undergraduate student from Columbia, and
Harty Frye, of the Berkeley Sociology
Department.

CI Warfare

Cleaver opened the discussion with a
definition of counterinsurgency. Quoting from
a military dictionary, he emphasized the wide
range of activities that fall within the military's
definition of counterinsurgency.
Admitted Work
Wiley then opened with the remark, "I am
involved in counterinsurgency work. I do not
deny it." After taking a short breath to deny
Cleaver's allegation that Jesse Hobson had ever
been president of United Fruit Co., Wiley
expanded on his opening statement, saying that
he has reached his own moral decisions about
the work he is doing.
Having worked in Thailand in the capacity
of an Anthropologist, Robert Texter opened
saying, "Had there been more scholarship in
studies of Thailand in the late '4 o's and
throughout the 1950'5, it is conceivable that
the Americans would have been aware of the
situation and that this international crime
would have been obviated."
TWLF Member
Pedro Albarracin, a Columbian and member
of the Third World Liberation Front then
spoke. He said that despite the American habit
of labeling all uprisings "communist," he and
his fellow students were fighting for liberty.

Classified research received mixed support in
yesterday morning's panel discussion on
Classified Research.
Professors H. Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Leonard
Schiff, Physics; William Baxter, Law; Associate
Professor Michael Arbib, Electrical Engineering
and Research Associate Lee Herzenberg of the

Secrecy

Medical School spoke before a crowd which
overflowed into the small lounge. Robert Jaafe,

research university along the lines of
Rockefeller Institute. His tentative proposal
urged that SRI be a separate entity with a
distinct administration, but that its faculty have
equal responsibility in determining research
policy. He advocated that faculty hold joint
membership in each institution.

"Counterinsurgency: At Home and Abroad"
was the concern of a seven man panel in front
of more than five hundred students in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The two-hour panel was moderated by
Barton Bernstein, Associate Professor of
History. Panel members were Harry Cleaver, a
graduate student in Economics and co-author
of one SRI committee minority report, Gordon
Wiley, Executive director of Systems Analysis
at SRI, John Lewis, professor in Political
Science, Robert Textor an Education and
Anthropology Professor, Pedro Albarracin an
undergraduate student from Columbia, and
Harty Frye, of the Berkeley Sociology
Department.

CI Warfare

Cleaver opened the discussion with a
definition of counterinsurgency. Quoting from
a military dictionary, he emphasized the wide
range of activities that fall within the military's
definition of counterinsurgency.
Admitted Work
Wiley then opened with the remark, "I am
involved in counterinsurgency work. I do not
deny it." After taking a short breath to deny
Cleaver's allegation that Jesse Hobson had ever
been president of United Fruit Co., Wiley
expanded on his opening statement, saying that
he has reached his own moral decisions about
the work he is doing.
Having worked in Thailand in the capacity
of an Anthropologist, Robert Texter opened
saying, "Had there been more scholarship in
studies of Thailand in the late '4 o's and
throughout the 1950'5, it is conceivable that
the Americans would have been aware of the
situation and that this international crime
would have been obviated."
TWLF Member
Pedro Albarracin, a Columbian and member
of the Third World Liberation Front then
spoke. He said that despite the American habit
of labeling all uprisings "communist," he and
his fellow students were fighting for liberty.

Classified research received mixed support in
yesterday morning's panel discussion on
Classified Research.
Professors H. Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Leonard
Schiff, Physics; William Baxter, Law; Associate
Professor Michael Arbib, Electrical Engineering
and Research Associate Lee Herzenberg of the

Secrecy

Medical School spoke before a crowd which
overflowed into the small lounge. Robert Jaafe,
graduate student in Physics, acted as moderator
for the group.
Each speaker was asked to give a five-minute
presentation, relating the importance of
classification of research, and whether such
declassification of projects infringes on the
researcher's individual academic freedom.
Baxter Support
Professor Baxter was the only speaker who
spoke definitely in favor of classified research,
maintaining that declassification places external
pressure upon the researcher involved: in effect
that "the needs of society override the
individual's research." Prof. Baxter likened the
present situation to the Anti-Darwinism of the
Thirties; society was frightened by the
implications of the work being done and
attempts to place moral judgements, which
later proved false, were made upon it.
Strongly opposed to Prof. Baxter were Lee
Herzenberg, the only woman on the panel, and
Associate Professor Michael Arbib, who
retaliated against Prof. Baxter's analogy with a
quotation from Shaw: No matter what one may
learn about the effect of high temperatures on
humans, one still does not have the right to put
one's mother-in-law in the oven . . . His remarks
drew laughter and applause.
Speakers Noyes, Pettit, and Schiff presented
more moderate views. Professor Schiff
suggested that openness of research take
precedence over a researcher's individual right
for secrecy. A university, he said, is a place for
academic give and take, a center for learning
and discussion.
Movement, started things off with
a brief history of the development
of Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and the military research
carried on there.
Shoch focused on counter
insurgency research at SRI,
concluding that "SRI has been
signigicantly and importantly
involved in counterinsurgency
research directed against members
of the Third World in Southeast
Asia and Latin America.
"SRI or Stanford has no right
to be complicit in any operations
and research determining the
future of these people."
Continuing the discussion on

research at SRI was Bonnar Cox,
assistant executive director of the
Information Sciences and
Engineering Div. at SRI.
Cox personally feels that "SRI
must be responsive to all public
agencies, not exclusive of the
federal government, to do
research that is legally permitted
and for which SRI has a clear
demonstrable competence or
capability.
Objecting to "any implication
as to the moral deficiency of the
SRI community," Cox continued,
"I submit that our researchers
meet an obligation both to
themselves and the world at large
by constantly considering moral
and ethical issues as related to the
research they carry out."
Matthew Sands, a professor
and deputy director at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator,
concerned himself with value
judgments on war-related
research, stating that there is "a
morality, an ethic, to research and
scholarship."
Sands concluded, "We must
find some mechanism for facing
and making collective agreement
on the issues." Although he
believes value judgments won't be
universal, Sands still feels some
sort of consensus can be reached.
William Rambo, director of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
attempted to extend Sands' ideas
by investigating possible criteria
for defining "war-related
research."
Rambo fears "an automatic
acceptance by this community
without argument or individual
thought, of an association of the
term with evil—and a consequent
unacceptability of certain research
in consequence."

Chadwick, however, cautioned,
"There is a definite limit of
change that can be accomplished
short of tearing SRI down. The
report is completely polarized and
presents impossible extreme
solutions."
Some employees questionned
the content as well as the form of
challenges to SRl's present
position.
Bredo said he felt, "We should
be engaged in studies concerned
with the security of the United
States and its allies. We should be
free as an institution to make this
choice. This is not necessarily
warfare," he explained, "It is
helping the government of the
United States make better
decision."
Howard Vollmer, a senior
sociologist, explained how defense
work can change government
policy: "The way a client defines

a problem is often superficial. In
our research we try to get at the
root causes that he has. This is
why many of the people military
or defense projects are convinced
their work has a significant effect
in modifying defense policies,
often in reducing the level of
military activity.
"These people feel that if they
were prohibited from working on
these kinds of projects, that the
military authorities would have to
turn to incompetent people to do
some of their research and would
therefore not have the advantage
of insights and scientific that we
can provide."
SRI administrator Rudolf
Brunsvold pinpointed the SRI
dilemma Monday, noting that all
proposed alternatives seem
financially and philosophically
objectionable to many of the SRI
staff, and the status quo seems
intolerable to other concerned
groups.
In an enthusiastically received speech in one
of yesterday's 'Day of Concern' panel
discussions noted theologian Robert McAffee
Brown called for placing "human freedom"
above academic freedom.
"I am convinced that we must face the
possibility of some limitations on 'academic
freedom' in the name of human
freedom—freedom for men to survive," Brown
said.
"It is not the task of a university to traffic in
death," he continued, "or to do anything that
will enhance the power of men to destroy one
another.
"I am left no alternative but to urge that the
university and SRI find ways to redirect their
research from war-directed to peace-directed
research, no matter how complex will be the
problem of differentiating those two directions
on specific contracts."
Concluding Statement
Brown's concluding statement received a
standing ovation: "So let me say this to
Professor Rambo and his colleagues at AEL:
if the phasing out of war-research loses you
valuable contracts, and this diminishes the
resources you have to continue the important
research you are already doing in other areas, I
pledge myself, and will urge my colleagues to
pledge, that we take whatever salary cuts are
necessary in order to help make up that loss, so
that your expertise, and that of all the other
research scientists at this university, can be put
to work in fully creative directions that will
help you fashion the kind of world we all
want."
Earlier in the same discussion Paul Bernstein,
a graduate student in political science warned,
"TTie human race as a whole has a half-life of
between ten and twenty years." Bernstein was
moderator of the panel discussion on
"War-Related Research: Stanford and SRI."
"This means," Bernstein told an overflow
crowd in Tresidder's large lounge, "that 50
percent of us have a chance of being alive 10 to
20 years from now."
James Shoch, an undergraduate in political
science and a member of SDS and the April 3

"You not only have to be a moral pigmy to
be engaged in biological warfare research, you
have to be a moron on top of it," remarked
Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb
and a biology professor at Stanford, at a panel
discussion held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday morning.
The statement was heavily applauded.
The discussion, attended by over 500
people, focused on the issue of war-related
research at Stanford and the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI). Victor von Schlegell,
vice-president of the ASSU, served as
moderator.
Ehrlich stated that he agreed with the
concerns of the recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, but emphasized the

Morality

importance of not changing the role of the
University as a tool for change. "It would be a
selfish thing to destroy our effectiveness around
the world for the fulfillment of our immediate
moral concerns," he noted.
Efficacy of Action
Panelist Steve Weissman, replying to
Ehrlich's argument, explained that he had a
firm belief in the effectiveness of action. He
asked if the failure to employ any means would
insure that the desired ends would not be
brought about. "We have to make a choice. Wo
must choose a means," Weissman said.
Harvey Hukari, President of the Young
Americans for Freedom, (YAF) prefaces his
remarks by saying that he was in the position of
being a "devil's advocate. There has been an
effort to place a political issue in a moral
context. It is heresy to speak against morality."
He went on to reject the idea of
institutionalized morality.
"I am delighted that the April 3rd Coalition
brought, the issue to the minds of professors
who might otherwise not have thought of it,"
Huknri stated. He added, however, that he
disagreed strongly with both the goals and the
tactics of the movement.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the
alternatives open to both the university and
SRI, a panel of students, faculty, and SRI
researchers discussed "Stanford and SRI:
Towards a Viable Relationship" before a full
auditorium in Cubberlev vesterdav afternoon.

Moderated by Michael Menke, SLAC physicist,

"You not only have to be a moral pigmy to
be engaged in biological warfare research, you
have to be a moron on top of it," remarked
Paul Ehrlich, author of The Population Bomb
and a biology professor at Stanford, at a panel
discussion held in Dinkelspiel Auditorium
yesterday morning.
The statement was heavily applauded.
The discussion, attended by over 500
people, focused on the issue of war-related
research at Stanford and the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI). Victor von Schlegell,
vice-president of the ASSU, served as
moderator.
Ehrlich stated that he agreed with the
concerns of the recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, but emphasized the

Morality

importance of not changing the role of the
University as a tool for change. "It would be a
selfish thing to destroy our effectiveness around
the world for the fulfillment of our immediate
moral concerns," he noted.
Efficacy of Action
Panelist Steve Weissman, replying to
Ehrlich's argument, explained that he had a
firm belief in the effectiveness of action. He
asked if the failure to employ any means would
insure that the desired ends would not be
brought about. "We have to make a choice. Wo
must choose a means," Weissman said.
Harvey Hukari, President of the Young
Americans for Freedom, (YAF) prefaces his
remarks by saying that he was in the position of
being a "devil's advocate. There has been an
effort to place a political issue in a moral
context. It is heresy to speak against morality."
He went on to reject the idea of
institutionalized morality.
"I am delighted that the April 3rd Coalition
brought, the issue to the minds of professors
who might otherwise not have thought of it,"
Huknri stated. He added, however, that he
disagreed strongly with both the goals and the
tactics of the movement.

Expressing dissatisfaction with the
alternatives open to both the university and
SRI, a panel of students, faculty, and SRI
researchers discussed "Stanford and SRI:
Towards a Viable Relationship" before a full
auditorium in Cubberlev vesterdav afternoon.

Stanford^Sßl

Moderated by Michael Menke, SLAC physicist,
the two hour discussion marked the conclusion
of the ASSU-sponsored "Day of Concern."
Labelling the Scott Report on SRI
"unimaginative," Roulette Smith, one of the
panelists, suggested converting SRI into a
research university along the lines of
Rockefeller Institute. His tentative proposal
urged that SRI be a separate entity with a
distinct administration, but that its faculty have
equal responsibility in determining research
policy. He advocated that faculty hold joint
membership in each institution.

"Counterinsurgency: At Home and Abroad"
was the concern of a seven man panel in front
of more than five hundred students in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium yesterday.
The two-hour panel was moderated by
Barton Bernstein, Associate Professor of
History. Panel members were Harry Cleaver, a
graduate student in Economics and co-author
of one SRI committee minority report, Gordon
Wiley, Executive director of Systems Analysis
at SRI, John Lewis, professor in Political
Science, Robert Textor an Education and
Anthropology Professor, Pedro Albarracin an
undergraduate student from Columbia, and
Harty Frye, of the Berkeley Sociology
Department.

CI Warfare

Cleaver opened the discussion with a
definition of counterinsurgency. Quoting from
a military dictionary, he emphasized the wide
range of activities that fall within the military's
definition of counterinsurgency.
Admitted Work
Wiley then opened with the remark, "I am
involved in counterinsurgency work. I do not
deny it." After taking a short breath to deny
Cleaver's allegation that Jesse Hobson had ever
been president of United Fruit Co., Wiley
expanded on his opening statement, saying that
he has reached his own moral decisions about
the work he is doing.
Having worked in Thailand in the capacity
of an Anthropologist, Robert Texter opened
saying, "Had there been more scholarship in
studies of Thailand in the late '4 o's and
throughout the 1950'5, it is conceivable that
the Americans would have been aware of the
situation and that this international crime
would have been obviated."
TWLF Member
Pedro Albarracin, a Columbian and member
of the Third World Liberation Front then
spoke. He said that despite the American habit
of labeling all uprisings "communist," he and
his fellow students were fighting for liberty.

Classified research received mixed support in
yesterday morning's panel discussion on
Classified Research.
Professors H. Pierre Noyes, SLAC; Leonard
Schiff, Physics; William Baxter, Law; Associate
Professor Michael Arbib, Electrical Engineering
and Research Associate Lee Herzenberg of the

Secrecy

Medical School spoke before a crowd which
overflowed into the small lounge. Robert Jaafe,
graduate student in Physics, acted as moderator
for the group.
Each speaker was asked to give a five-minute
presentation, relating the importance of
classification of research, and whether such
declassification of projects infringes on the
researcher's individual academic freedom.
Baxter Support
Professor Baxter was the only speaker who
spoke definitely in favor of classified research,
maintaining that declassification places external
pressure upon the researcher involved: in effect
that "the needs of society override the
individual's research." Prof. Baxter likened the
present situation to the Anti-Darwinism of the
Thirties; society was frightened by the
implications of the work being done and
attempts to place moral judgements, which
later proved false, were made upon it.
Strongly opposed to Prof. Baxter were Lee
Herzenberg, the only woman on the panel, and
Associate Professor Michael Arbib, who
retaliated against Prof. Baxter's analogy with a
quotation from Shaw: No matter what one may
learn about the effect of high temperatures on
humans, one still does not have the right to put
one's mother-in-law in the oven . . . His remarks
drew laughter and applause.
Speakers Noyes, Pettit, and Schiff presented
more moderate views. Professor Schiff
suggested that openness of research take
precedence over a researcher's individual right
for secrecy. A university, he said, is a place for
academic give and take, a center for learning
and discussion.
Movement, started things off with
a brief history of the development
of Stanford Research Institute
(SRI) and the military research
carried on there.
Shoch focused on counter
insurgency research at SRI,
concluding that "SRI has been
signigicantly and importantly
involved in counterinsurgency
research directed against members
of the Third World in Southeast
Asia and Latin America.
"SRI or Stanford has no right
to be complicit in any operations
and research determining the
future of these people."
Continuing the discussion on

research at SRI was Bonnar Cox,
assistant executive director of the
Information Sciences and
Engineering Div. at SRI.
Cox personally feels that "SRI
must be responsive to all public
agencies, not exclusive of the
federal government, to do
research that is legally permitted
and for which SRI has a clear
demonstrable competence or
capability.
Objecting to "any implication
as to the moral deficiency of the
SRI community," Cox continued,
"I submit that our researchers
meet an obligation both to
themselves and the world at large
by constantly considering moral
and ethical issues as related to the
research they carry out."
Matthew Sands, a professor
and deputy director at the
Stanford Linear Accelerator,
concerned himself with value
judgments on war-related
research, stating that there is "a
morality, an ethic, to research and
scholarship."
Sands concluded, "We must
find some mechanism for facing
and making collective agreement
on the issues." Although he
believes value judgments won't be
universal, Sands still feels some
sort of consensus can be reached.
William Rambo, director of the
Applied Electronics Laboratory,
attempted to extend Sands' ideas
by investigating possible criteria
for defining "war-related
research."
Rambo fears "an automatic
acceptance by this community
without argument or individual
thought, of an association of the
term with evil—and a consequent
unacceptability of certain research
in consequence."

Chadwick, however, cautioned,
"There is a definite limit of
change that can be accomplished
short of tearing SRI down. The
report is completely polarized and
presents impossible extreme
solutions."
Some employees questionned
the content as well as the form of
challenges to SRl's present
position.
Bredo said he felt, "We should
be engaged in studies concerned
with the security of the United
States and its allies. We should be
free as an institution to make this
choice. This is not necessarily
warfare," he explained, "It is
helping the government of the
United States make better
decision."
Howard Vollmer, a senior
sociologist, explained how defense
work can change government
policy: "The way a client defines

a problem is often superficial. In
our research we try to get at the
root causes that he has. This is
why many of the people military
or defense projects are convinced
their work has a significant effect
in modifying defense policies,
often in reducing the level of
military activity.
"These people feel that if they
were prohibited from working on
these kinds of projects, that the
military authorities would have to
turn to incompetent people to do
some of their research and would
therefore not have the advantage
of insights and scientific that we
can provide."
SRI administrator Rudolf
Brunsvold pinpointed the SRI
dilemma Monday, noting that all
proposed alternatives seem
financially and philosophically
objectionable to many of the SRI
staff, and the status quo seems
intolerable to other concerned
groups.
In an enthusiastically received speech in one
of yesterday's 'Day of Concern' panel
discussions noted theologian Robert McAffee
Brown called for placing "human freedom"
above academic freedom.
"I am convinced that we must face the
possibility of some limitations on 'academic
freedom' in the name of human
freedom—freedom for men to survive," Brown
said.
"It is not the task of a university to traffic in
death," he continued, "or to do anything that
will enhance the power of men to destroy one
another.
"I am left no alternative but to urge that the
university and SRI find ways to redirect their
research from war-directed to peace-directed
research, no matter how complex will be the
problem of differentiating those two directions
on specific contracts."
Concluding Statement
Brown's concluding statement received a
standing ovation: "So let me say this to
Professor Rambo and his colleagues at AEL:
if the phasing out of war-research loses you
valuable contracts, and this diminishes the
resources you have to continue the important
research you are already doing in other areas, I
pledge myself, and will urge my colleagues to
pledge, that we take whatever salary cuts are
necessary in order to help make up that loss, so
that your expertise, and that of all the other
research scientists at this university, can be put
to work in fully creative directions that will
help you fashion the kind of world we all
want."
Earlier in the same discussion Paul Bernstein,
a graduate student in political science warned,
"TTie human race as a whole has a half-life of
between ten and twenty years." Bernstein was
moderator of the panel discussion on
"War-Related Research: Stanford and SRI."
"This means," Bernstein told an overflow
crowd in Tresidder's large lounge, "that 50
percent of us have a chance of being alive 10 to
20 years from now."
