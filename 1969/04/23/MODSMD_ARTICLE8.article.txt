More than 600 people gathered in White
Plaza yesterday noon to watch a performance
by the San Francisco Mime Troupe. The Mime
Troupe is a non-profit, anti-establishment
puppet company. They also have a small band.
The troupe has been performing free in the
parks in the Bay area since 1961.
After the show, the Mime Troupe's
"Gorilla" band led about 100 persons in a
march to the school of business. The marchers
joined several hundred other persons who had
gathered at the business school for a "tour" of
the facilities.
Members of the April Third Movement spent
several hours at the business school, gathered in
the courtyard talking with students and staff.
The buildings were open for wandering and
there were no incidents.
