# SRI Study Report Debated By Panel
## 
### PAUL PAPANEK 
SRI has the right to set up its own
research guidelines, insisted SRI
President Charles A. Anderson at a
panel discussion yesterday.
The three-man panel, consisting of
Anderson, law student Doron Weinberg,
and business student Nick Faulk,
discussed the proposals of the recently
published SRI Study Committee Report
before about 250 students and faculty
in Bishop Auditorium.
Another discussion will be held
today at noon in the auditorium to
discuss the question of SRI and
war-related research.
Faulk, a member of the SRI Study
Committee, defended the majority
position that a covenanted sale of SRI
to itself was the best solution to the
problem.
He called the solution an
"uncomfortable but feasible" one, since
it would allow SRI to continue to
operate at a reduced level and would
also provide for some minimal
University control. He said such a
"series of trade-offs" was necessary.
Weinberg For Minority
Doron Weinberg, arguing for the
minority position, criticized this
alternative as the "worst possible one,"
since it satisfied neither SRI nor the
Stanford community. He said that from
a practical and legal point of view a
covenant was simply unworkable.
Anderson agreed that a covenanted
sale would be unacceptable to SRI,
since SRI would have to "change
drastically" under the weight of
research restrictions and the additional
financial burden of paying for itself.
He added that many SRI employees
would quit if their research were under
external control, and even hinted that
he himself might quit under such
conditions.
However, Anderson admitted that he
had no positive solutions to propose. He
said that he had recently consulted with
an ad hoc committee at SRI about the

possibility of having researchers, rather
than administrators, set up research
guidelines for SRI.
Yet he dismissed Nick Faulk's
suggestion to take a poll of all SRI
employees on the current difficulties as
"inappropriate."
Tigliter Control
Weinberg supported the minority
proposal to bring SRI under tighter
University control. When asked how he
could justify this infringement on the
academic freedom of SRI researchers to
determine their own areas of study, he
made a distinction between purely
intellectual research and research which
had an immediate, concrete effect on
others.
This latter area, he said, is subject to
control. "The idea that a group of
professionals can do research in a
certain area because they think it valid
is entirely new to me," Weinberg
remarked.
Faulk attacked the minority
suggestion to integrate SRI into the
University on the grounds that such a
move would "sabotage the University
function." "SRI and the University do
very different things," he noted. He
quipped that a Stanford-SRI link-up
would be as ridiculous as NYU's
ownership of a spaghetti-factory on the
side.
Partial Integration
Weinberg agreed that a total
integration of SRI and the University
would be foolish. Instead, he proposed a
partial integration, such that the
University would have a strong voice in
determining SRI policies.
A board to oversee research at SRI
would "ideally" be made up of Stanford
administration, faculty, and students,
SRI employees, and members of the
Menlo Park community, he said.
None of the panelists favored the
third alternativeâ€”outright sale of SRI to
a business firm, although Anderson said
that financially this was the best
solution.
