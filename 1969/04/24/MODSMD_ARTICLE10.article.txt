# A 						Deadly Silence
## 
### 
There is a stillness at Stanford.
It is more than the quiet between
storms, more resigned, more despairing,
and more accepting. It is the stillness of
worn bodies and tired minds.
The caustic wind that whipped across
campus yesterday afternoon stirred the
waters of Lagunita, swirled sand into dust
storms, and toppled sailboats, but the
people could not be awakened.
Last week the atmosphere was churning
with crisis. The community was tense and
worried, the hours were late, but there was
action and direction.
This week people are resting while they
despair that crisis can be avoided and look
inward for reassurance that the next attack
will not kill.
The mood is stifling and stagnating. It
hurts to see a University unable to help
itself. More than ever before it is apparent
that the answers are not found in one
department or one office, nor can one man
make one decision.
Yet rather than mobilizing the people
and resources to make decisions,
individuals seek to console themselves and
point to the faceless University as the
arbitrator.
Just at the moment when most needs to
be done, the fewest people are acting.
There is a sense of nostalgia in the air: look
back to the days of campus peace when
disputes were harmless, a day's work ended
at 5 p.m., and emergency calls did not
exist.
Stanford lias no middle ground. Either
crisis operations are established by the
University or normal procedures are
followed. Urgency vanishes when
disruptions end and people refuse to
believe that there is a need for constant

urgency to prevent heightened breakdowns.
The issues spotlighted by the April 3
Coalition scream for attention and the
impulse is strong to act on moral
commitment and to forgo constraint.
It is possible, even likely, that new
action will flair this weekend or soon
thereafter. The peace is not easy; the
prospects of renewed hostility need little
effort to imagine. Stanford cannot long
stand disruption. Quite apart from debate
whether destruction will improve the
University or not, the fact remains that
stopping its activities is not difficult.
Where, then, are the trustees this week?
They profess to care about Stanford.
Unquestionably, they hope to avoid
confrontations, but factually they are not
here when it counts.
More than a week ago, William Parmer
Fuller, president of the Board, promised to
hold an open trustee hearing on campus
about SRI. Time and place were to be
announced the next day. There was never
another word from Fuller.
The opportunity to take the initiative is
quickly passing. At Harvard, Cornell,
Columbia, and Stanford, the
administration, faculty, and trustees are
continually responding to student
demands. They are rarely there to initiate
change.
Once confrontation strikes, battle lines
are drawn and administration protagonists
lose energy and the will to proceed. The
washout becomes complete when people
are too tired to care.
In a month or a year, people may
remember this week as the time when
people cared only about themselves.

The silence stands next only to death.

It is possible, even likely, that new
action will flair this weekend or soon
thereafter. The peace is not easy; the
prospects of renewed hostility need little
effort to imagine. Stanford cannot long
stand disruption. Quite apart from debate
whether destruction will improve the
University or not, the fact remains that
stopping its activities is not difficult.
Where, then, are the trustees this week?
They profess to care about Stanford.
Unquestionably, they hope to avoid
confrontations, but factually they are not
here when it counts.
More than a week ago, William Parmer
Fuller, president of the Board, promised to
hold an open trustee hearing on campus
about SRI. Time and place were to be
announced the next day. There was never
another word from Fuller.
The opportunity to take the initiative is
quickly passing. At Harvard, Cornell,
Columbia, and Stanford, the
administration, faculty, and trustees are
continually responding to student
demands. They are rarely there to initiate
change.
Once confrontation strikes, battle lines
are drawn and administration protagonists
lose energy and the will to proceed. The
washout becomes complete when people
are too tired to care.
In a month or a year, people may
remember this week as the time when
people cared only about themselves.
There is a stillness at Stanford.
The silence stands next only to death.
There is a stillness at Stanford.
It is more than the quiet between
storms, more resigned, more despairing,
and more accepting. It is the stillness of
worn bodies and tired minds.
The caustic wind that whipped across
campus yesterday afternoon stirred the
waters of Lagunita, swirled sand into dust
storms, and toppled sailboats, but the
people could not be awakened.
Last week the atmosphere was churning
with crisis. The community was tense and
worried, the hours were late, but there was
action and direction.
This week people are resting while they
despair that crisis can be avoided and look
inward for reassurance that the next attack
will not kill.
The mood is stifling and stagnating. It
hurts to see a University unable to help
itself. More than ever before it is apparent
that the answers are not found in one
department or one office, nor can one man
make one decision.
Yet rather than mobilizing the people
and resources to make decisions,
individuals seek to console themselves and
point to the faceless University as the
arbitrator.
Just at the moment when most needs to
be done, the fewest people are acting.
There is a sense of nostalgia in the air: look
back to the days of campus peace when
disputes were harmless, a day's work ended
at 5 p.m., and emergency calls did not
exist.
Stanford lias no middle ground. Either
crisis operations are established by the
University or normal procedures are
followed. Urgency vanishes when
disruptions end and people refuse to
believe that there is a need for constant

urgency to prevent heightened breakdowns.
The issues spotlighted by the April 3
Coalition scream for attention and the
impulse is strong to act on moral
commitment and to forgo constraint.
