# From The Ivory Tower
## BSU Charges Valid 
### H. Bruce Franklin 
When the statement of the
Black. Student Union defined the
Stanford Board of Trustees as a
symbol of racism and imperialism,
the audience had a hard time
accepting it the way it was said.
Perhaps it would be clearer in the
words of the enemy. The main
issue within SRI was well defined
by its own director eighteen years
ago. Here is Jesse Hobson,
Director of Stanford Research
Institute in 1951, describing very
eloquently what the issue really
is:
This nation occupies 69'r of
the land area of the world,
has 7% of the world's
population, but it now
produces 50% of the world's
goods and possesses 67% of
the world's wealth.
Research must be the heart,
the foundation, the
lifcblood of our present
defense economy if we are
to maintain this position.
Now what this means is
well-explained in the words of
someone in the Academic Council
meeting the morning of April 18.
Speaking, ironically enough, in
the name of the party of order, he
said, referring to the sit-in, "I
define coercion as any attempt by
a minority to impose its will on
the majority."
The fact of the matter is that
the central coercive act in the
world today is the coercive racism
and imperialism of the ruling
class—yes, those are the right
words—of this country on the
peoples of the Third World abroad
and at home and, less nakedly,
over white working people of this
country.
I know a lot of you may not
believe that. There are many other
definitions of the central problem
of the world, and what we ought
to face is that the concerns of

Stanford research and the
concerns of the research at SRI
are intimately connected and even
some of the most seemingly
harmless liberal forms of research
at Stanford are part of this
oppression and coercion of the
peoples of the Third World.
Over-Population
I shall cite you as one example
the new Malthusian theories that
are coming out of Stanford
University, telling us that the
central problem of the world is
over-population. This is another
form of racism, and it subtly
prepares our minds to accept
genocide.
The question is not
over-population. The question is
the systematic looting of the
resources of the entire world by
the ruling class of this country,
represented here most concretely
by the Board of Trustees, and
indirectly by many of their
lackeys in the rest of the
administrative and functional
machinery of both Stanford
University and SRI.
Third World Voice
Now when the Black Student
Union suggested that Black people
have some sort of say about the
research being conducted at SRI,
there was almost total silence
among the people at Frost,-except
for a little tiny bit of approval and
some grumbling and murmering
and sounds that suggested that
that was just ridiculous.
But we ought to recognize the
basic coercion even in the way we
sit at some gathering, with all of
us so nice and white, with a few
well-chosen exceptions, Hoover
Tower symbolically staring at us
in the background. Unless we do
act, unless we do chose the sides
of the majority that is being
coerced, we are on the side of that

minority that is imposing its will
on the majority.
And if we are going to fight, as
I think we should fight, for the
control over the research at
Stanford Research Institute, the
"we" that has to be doing that
fighting must not be just Stanford
students and faculty but must
include those representatives of
the Third World that we do have
among us.
