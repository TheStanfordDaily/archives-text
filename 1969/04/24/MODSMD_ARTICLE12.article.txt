# Letter
## Self-Centered? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Whoever wrote the Editor's
Note appended to the letter from
Dr. Wessells has to be one of the
all-time champs in self-centered
interpretation. In the unlikely
event that no one else has
attempted to set you straight, Dr.
Wessells was telling you that it
was none of your damned
business as editor of The Daily to
be sending telegrams around the
country espousing a cause. He was
talking to you, not about research
but rather about your lack of
objectivity in using your position
as editor for what you think is
right. What a colossal ego you

must have to think that Dr.
Wessells cannot read, and how
magnanimous of you to obliquely
apologize for your syntax in the
telegram.
The next time you want to
influence somebody on the
University of Washington campus,
go buy your own telegram and
sign your own name to it. And for
crying out loud, start objectively
reporting the events on this
campus. That may keep you so
busy you won't have time to
direct the affairs of the University
of Washington or any other
campus.
