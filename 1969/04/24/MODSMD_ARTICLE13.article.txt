## Military No Place For Ambivalence 
### Austin Hurst 
Perhaps my recent head-on
confrontation with the Navy from
within may be of significant
interest and help to graduating
senior males contemplating
entering the military despite the
fact that they entertain
ambivalent views toward it.
This was my attitude when I
entered the Navy Aviation Officer
Candidate School at Pensacola,
Florida last July. I was against the
conflict in Southeast Asia before
entering the hallowed ranks but
wasn't against the military
entirely.
I felt it was "necessary in some
respects." I also felt that I
sincerely would not be
compromising my values by flying
a patrol plane or other
non-combat type aircraft in a
friendly environment such as the
Mediterranean. This may appear
to be a naive assumption, but it
actually was not because the top
of each class usually gets his
choice of what type plane he
wishes to fly. After taking the
Mickey Mouse qualifying tests I
was assured of being at the top.
Anyway, I got caught up in the
childish games of officer training
for 11 weeks, detesting it yet
somehow excelling so that I
graduated at the top of my class
on commissioning in October.
Then I got into the flying bit
which in itself was very enjoyable,
but I found all along that rather
than being forced subconsciously
into a more conservative and
submissive attitude, I actually was
going in the opposite direction.
Pushed To Left
I was in a sense being pushed
to the left by the Big Ugly
Machine. My growing realization
of how dehumanizing the military
is, the awareness that my testicles
were constantly in the Pentagon's
vice, and the Vietnam war made
more real to me, forced me to do
what I had to—what I should have
done before I entered the
mess -rebel.
Hate exists . ..
and a child is dead.
Brass buttons, spaghetti, and a fake
smile can no longer propitiate
the herd.
Love docs exist,
while bellicose fools play God.
Let us watch them drown-in their
own blood.
Then we can live.
Admittedly the Vietnam war

was the biggest factor because I
suddenly felt that it didn't really
matter which pilots drop the
bombs and which ones fly the
patrol planes in the
Mediterranean, so my previous
maxim of not compromising
myself no longer had relevance.
After hearing the returned touted
Vietnam fliers tell of turning
human beings into "crispy
critters" with napalm and saying
that bombing and killing is
"where the real excitement is," I
realized that the military is
essentially Vietnam and I
concluded that I would no longer
be a pawn in the Pentagon's sick
game. I wanted out—to be
constructive, not destructive.
The Brass
Not being brave but doing
what I had to led me to the big
brass. Before them I simply
denounced the war and the
military. Of course these dudes
with the stars let their disapproval
of me be known and such words
as "communist" and "spineless
malcontent" reached my ears.
However, we did agree on one
point—l was misplaced and didn't
have the qualities of a "good
officer" so I was given the
opportunity to send a letter to the
Secretary of the Navy resigning
my commission and requesting a
discharge. These officers could
give no assurance that my request
would be granted, but I was told
that the chances of getting out
would be better if I requested an
undesirable discharge as opposed
to a general discharge. Thus, I
requested the former, not holding
the repercussions to be important.
After 11 weeks of mucho
worry and sweat I got word that I
would be discharged immediately
with a General Discharge under
honorable conditions. The hassle
was over and the results, though
unexpected, were most fortunate.
Lucky Exception
What I really want to
emphasize as paramount to this
whole ditty is that it is pure hell
trying to live a phony ass-kissing
life in an anarchronistic gamut of
life if you don't dig it. It cannot
be done by someone who lives life
intensely. It must also be realized
that my case is a "lucky
exception" to what usually
happens to dissenters within the
military.

Therefore I strongly urge the
mixed-up or the ambivalent to
fight the nightmare of the military
before he gets trapped within it. It
of course is easy for me to urge
rebellion against the draft, war,
etc. now that I no longer face the
possibility of jail for my rebelling
scene, but I feel that I could easily
have been made an example to
discourage others from following
my actions. Thus others
attempting a fight from within
could be less fortunate.

Denied
(Upon observing a military cemetery)
Denied the Gift to breathe,
no sadder times exist.
Amber-colored heartaches
found struggling in the mist.
Denied the Gift of sight
for who, other perverted eyes,
See only gruesome pictures
placed somewhat in disguise.
Denied the Gift to love,
the lips will no more meet.
Prayed desires of freedom
lay at the body's feet.
Denied the Gift to live
because the cause was just—

Just to follow others
to the cliff and not distrust.
Denied the Gift of pureness
discolored by pompous toads.
Who make the life of sickness,
it leads to many roads.
Denied the Gift to die
by other means than hate,
Contorted life for mushrooms
also in the mottled fate.
