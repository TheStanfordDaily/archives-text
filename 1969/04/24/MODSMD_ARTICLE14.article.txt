## Strong Faculty Stand 
### Art Buchwald 
One of the things that
impresses people about the
student demonstrations is the
strong stand that some members
of the faculty are taking on the
issues.
I was on the campus of
Northamnesty University and ran
into a professor who was trying to
stop his nose from bleeding. His
clothes were torn up and he was
walking with a pronounced limp.
"What happened, Professor?" I
asked, as I helped him search for
his glasses.
"The militant students just
took over my office and threw me
down the stairs."
"Why, that's terrible," I said.
"From my point of view it is,
but I think we have to look at it
from their point of view. Why did
they throw me down the stairs?
Where have we, as faculty, failed
them?"
"Are you going to press
charges?"
"On the contrary. If I pressed
charges, I would only be playing
into the hands of the repressive
forces outside the university who
would like nothing better than to
see the students arrested for
assault."
"But they did assault you?"
"Yes. I have to admit I was
surprised about that. But there
was one heartening note. As they
threw me down the stairs, one of
the students yelled, 'It isn't you,
Professor. It's the system."

"That must have made you feel
better."
"Say, Professor, isn't that the
philosophy building going up in
flames?"
"I believe it is. Now, why did
they have to go and set fire to the
philosophy building?"
"I was going to ask you that."
"I'm not quite sure, because I
haven't seen any of the students
since they threw me down the
stairs. My guess is that it probably
has to do with something the
administration and the students
are at odds about."
"But that's a terrible thing to
do."
"I don't think we should make
judgments until all facts are in. I
would say burning down a
philosophy building could be
interpreted as an unlawful act. At
the same time, there are moments
when an unlawful act can bring
about just reforms."
"But the books, the records,
the papers are all going up in
smoke. Shouldn't we at least call
the fire department?"
"I don't believe the fire
department should be called until
the faculty has met and voted on
what course of action should be
taken. There are times when a fire
department can only inflame a
situation."
"I never thought of it that
way," I admitted. "Professor, I
know you can't see very well
without your glasses, but I believe
the militant students over at the

quadrangle are building a scaffold.
They wouldn't hang anyone,
would they?"
"They haven't before," the
professor said. "But it's quite
possible that this is their way of
seeking a confrontation with the
establishment."
As we were talking, a group of
students rushed up and grabbed
the professor. "We got one here,"
the ringleader shouted. "Get the
rope."
"Don't worry, Professor," I
shouted as I was pushed away by
the mob. "I'll get tiie police."
"I wish you wouldn't," he said
calmly, as the students led him
toward the scaffold. "If we don't
let the students try new methods
of activism, they'll never know for
themselves which ones work and
which ones are counterproduc
tive."
