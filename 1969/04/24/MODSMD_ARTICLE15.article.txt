# Letters To The Editor
## Brown's Speech Clarified 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I did not realize that my
seven-minute comment as one
panel member at the"Day of
Concern" would be considered
either a "speech" or a "highlight."
It was no more than a skeletal
introduction to a vary difficult
problem, and the reproduction in
the Daily of a couple of isolated
quotations has apparently shed
more heat than light among
readers. I would like the privilege
of clarifying a few points briefly:
1. To my colleagues in the
sciences, let me point out that I
began by saying, "The issues of
war-related research must not get
posed as a " h umanities-vs.
sciences" issue. There is some
danger that people in the
humanities may swoop down like
moral crusaders, condemning the

scientists . . .The best case against
war-research, if it is to be made,
will be made by a scientist who
knows all the intricacies of the
problem in a way I never will." I
really believe that, and everything
else I said was meant to be
understood in that context.
2. I was assuming an emerging
agreement on this campus and
elsewhere that some kinds of
research are not appropriate to
the university, and it was in this
context that I suggested that if we
believe this, some criteria will be
needed for distinguishing, which
task I indicated is being
undertaken by the scientists
themselves. Any such decisions
mean some curtailment of
freedom to do just any kind of
research, and this was the context
of what must have seemed the

simplistic distinction between
"academic freedom" and "human
freedom." Both Professor Sands
and Rambo gave great help in
describing the spectrum along
which such intricate decisions
have to be made.
3. Some have apparently felt
that my comments were meant to
be inflammatory or divisive. Let
me state as clearly as I can: we are
past the time when the rhetoric of
emotion is sufficient ground for
discussion, or when the
attribution of "morality" only to
one's own position is defensible.
(This is why I disavowed the
appropriateness of the applause
with which I was at one point
interrupted.) If the opposite
impression has been conveyed to
those who were not there, I am
deeply sorry.

4. Our task now is to continue
the kind of exchange that was
experienced yesterday by so
many, and I hope we can stay on
the issues illuminated by the"Day
of Concern" rather than moving
into a new round of
confrontations that will always
carry the possibility of having to
call police or shutting down the
university, since such tactics will
surely now not only be
diversionary but will postpone if
not destroy the kinds of creative
directions in which Stanford can
now move.
This is a statement of faith in
the university reformed rather
than the university destroyed, and
I hope this campus can avoid
tactics that will jeopardize the
former for the sake of the latter.

Editor, THE DAILY:
As a former member of the
National Union of French
Students (UNEF) I am somewhat
perplexed by the "telegram"
which is being distributed at
Stanford University (see
"Declassified," Volume I, no. 10)
and which is claimed to be an
expression of UNEF solidarity
with ''Stanford students'
struggling against the use of the
universities to pursue military,
imperialistic end." A legitimate
telegram sent by UNEF would be
signed by the union's
Secretary-General, Jacques
Sauvageot, followed by the initials
UNEF.
Under no circumstances would
it be signed "UNEF SOLIDAIRE
DES ETUDIANTS DE
STANFORD." It would appear
that rather than being an
expression of UNEF support, the
"telegram" is just simply a
fabrication of David Pugh and
some friends in Paris, who were
willing to help boost Pugh's ego.
At first I thought that the
Stanford community would
realize this, but although I am
only visiting the area and do not
know the University very well,
what I have seen so far, alas, gave
me some second thoughts.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In your issue of April 23 you f
quote me as having said at the
teach-in that "had there been
more scholarship in studies of
Thailand in the late '40s and
throughout the 1950'5, it is
conceivable that the Americans
would have been aware of the
situation and this international
crime would have been obviated." !
Actually, my reference was to
Vietnam, not Thailand, and to the
international crime that has been
perpetrated in Vietnam by
American policy. However, I also
believe that Americans who are
Thailand specialists ought to be
making more significant
contributions to the improvement

of U.S. policy vis-avis Thailand
that they are in fact currently
making. The welfare of the people
of Thailand is in many ways
materially influenced by U.S.
policy, whether one likes it or
not. As long as this is the case,
U.S. policy toward Thailand
should be not only humane but
informed. It often is not very well
informed.

I am as greatly concerned
about the tactics of the April 3rd
Movement as I am the issue of
SRl—Stanford relations. Thus I
was appalled at the article headed
"ASSU Poll Indicates Students
Favor Sit-In."
The wording of the ballot did
not say this at all, but, in fact,
states that the sit-in "Has helped
focus the attention of the
University upon the nature of
research conducted at Stanford."
Kindly do not editorialize
"news" stories. If you wish to
infer the conclusion of the
heading of the article from the
results of the balloting, keep it off
the front page and place it in an

of those members who rudely
interrupted and tried to shout
down Professor H. Bruce Franklin
while he was making his statement
at the meeting of the Academic
Council last Friday. Mr. Franklin,
having been recognized by the
Chair, was entitled to such
privileges as any of his colleagues
would rightly expect to be
accorded while speaking to the
assembly. We deplore this breach
of courtesy toward a fellow

I am as greatly concerned
about the tactics of the April 3rd
Movement as I am the issue of
SRl—Stanford relations. Thus I
was appalled at the article headed
"ASSU Poll Indicates Students
Favor Sit-In."
The wording of the ballot did
not say this at all, but, in fact,
states that the sit-in "Has helped
focus the attention of the
University upon the nature of
research conducted at Stanford."
Kindly do not editorialize
"news" stories. If you wish to
infer the conclusion of the
heading of the article from the
results of the balloting, keep it off

I did not realize that my
seven-minute comment as one
panel member at the"Day of
Concern" would be considered
either a "speech" or a "highlight."
It was no more than a skeletal
introduction to a vary difficult
problem, and the reproduction in
the Daily of a couple of isolated
quotations has apparently shed
more heat than light among
readers. I would like the privilege
of clarifying a few points briefly:
1. To my colleagues in the
sciences, let me point out that I
began by saying, "The issues of
war-related research must not get
posed as a " h umanities-vs.
sciences" issue. There is some
danger that people in the
humanities may swoop down like
moral crusaders, condemning the

scientists . . .The best case against
war-research, if it is to be made,
will be made by a scientist who
knows all the intricacies of the
problem in a way I never will." I
really believe that, and everything
else I said was meant to be
understood in that context.
2. I was assuming an emerging
agreement on this campus and
elsewhere that some kinds of
research are not appropriate to
the university, and it was in this
context that I suggested that if we
believe this, some criteria will be
needed for distinguishing, which
task I indicated is being
undertaken by the scientists
themselves. Any such decisions
mean some curtailment of
freedom to do just any kind of
research, and this was the context
of what must have seemed the

simplistic distinction between
"academic freedom" and "human
freedom." Both Professor Sands
and Rambo gave great help in
describing the spectrum along
which such intricate decisions
have to be made.
3. Some have apparently felt
that my comments were meant to
be inflammatory or divisive. Let
me state as clearly as I can: we are
past the time when the rhetoric of
emotion is sufficient ground for
discussion, or when the
attribution of "morality" only to
one's own position is defensible.
(This is why I disavowed the
appropriateness of the applause
with which I was at one point
interrupted.) If the opposite
impression has been conveyed to
those who were not there, I am
deeply sorry.

4. Our task now is to continue
the kind of exchange that was
experienced yesterday by so
many, and I hope we can stay on
the issues illuminated by the"Day
of Concern" rather than moving
into a new round of
confrontations that will always
carry the possibility of having to
call police or shutting down the
university, since such tactics will
surely now not only be
diversionary but will postpone if
not destroy the kinds of creative
directions in which Stanford can
now move.
This is a statement of faith in
the university reformed rather
than the university destroyed, and
I hope this campus can avoid
tactics that will jeopardize the
former for the sake of the latter.

As a former member of the
National Union of French
Students (UNEF) I am somewhat
perplexed by the "telegram"
which is being distributed at
Stanford University (see
"Declassified," Volume I, no. 10)
and which is claimed to be an
expression of UNEF solidarity
with ''Stanford students'
struggling against the use of the
universities to pursue military,
imperialistic end." A legitimate
telegram sent by UNEF would be
signed by the union's
Secretary-General, Jacques
Sauvageot, followed by the initials
UNEF.
Under no circumstances would
it be signed "UNEF SOLIDAIRE
DES ETUDIANTS DE
STANFORD." It would appear
that rather than being an
expression of UNEF support, the
"telegram" is just simply a
fabrication of David Pugh and
some friends in Paris, who were
willing to help boost Pugh's ego.
At first I thought that the
Stanford community would
realize this, but although I am
only visiting the area and do not
know the University very well,
what I have seen so far, alas, gave
me some second thoughts.

In your issue of April 23 you f

more scholarship in studies of
Thailand in the late '40s and
throughout the 1950'5, it is
conceivable that the Americans
would have been aware of the
situation and this international
crime would have been obviated." !
Actually, my reference was to
Vietnam, not Thailand, and to the
international crime that has been
perpetrated in Vietnam by
American policy. However, I also
believe that Americans who are
Thailand specialists ought to be
making more significant
contributions to the improvement

of U.S. policy vis-avis Thailand

"Declassified," Volume I, no. 10)
and which is claimed to be an
expression of UNEF solidarity
with ''Stanford students'
struggling against the use of the
universities to pursue military,
imperialistic end." A legitimate
telegram sent by UNEF would be
signed by the union's
Secretary-General, Jacques
Sauvageot, followed by the initials
UNEF.
Under no circumstances would
it be signed "UNEF SOLIDAIRE

that rather than being an
expression of UNEF support, the
"telegram" is just simply a
fabrication of David Pugh and
some friends in Paris, who were
willing to help boost Pugh's ego.
At first I thought that the
Stanford community would
realize this, but although I am

know the University very well,
what I have seen so far, alas, gave
me some second thoughts.

In your issue of April 23 you f
quote me as having said at the
teach-in that "had there been
more scholarship in studies of
Thailand in the late '40s and
throughout the 1950'5, it is
conceivable that the Americans
would have been aware of the
situation and this international
crime would have been obviated." !
Actually, my reference was to
Vietnam, not Thailand, and to the
international crime that has been
perpetrated in Vietnam by
American policy. However, I also
believe that Americans who are
Thailand specialists ought to be
making more significant
contributions to the improvement

of U.S. policy vis-avis Thailand
that they are in fact currently
making. The welfare of the people
of Thailand is in many ways
materially influenced by U.S.
policy, whether one likes it or
not. As long as this is the case,
U.S. policy toward Thailand
should be not only humane but
informed. It often is not very well
informed.

I am as greatly concerned
about the tactics of the April 3rd
Movement as I am the issue of
SRl—Stanford relations. Thus I
was appalled at the article headed
"ASSU Poll Indicates Students
Favor Sit-In."
The wording of the ballot did
not say this at all, but, in fact,
states that the sit-in "Has helped
focus the attention of the
University upon the nature of
research conducted at Stanford."
Kindly do not editorialize

I did not realize that my
seven-minute comment as one
panel member at the"Day of
Concern" would be considered
either a "speech" or a "highlight."
It was no more than a skeletal
introduction to a vary difficult
problem, and the reproduction in
the Daily of a couple of isolated
quotations has apparently shed
more heat than light among
readers. I would like the privilege
of clarifying a few points briefly:
1. To my colleagues in the
sciences, let me point out that I
began by saying, "The issues of
war-related research must not get
posed as a " h umanities-vs.
sciences" issue. There is some
danger that people in the
humanities may swoop down like
moral crusaders, condemning the

scientists . . .The best case against
war-research, if it is to be made,
will be made by a scientist who
knows all the intricacies of the
problem in a way I never will." I
really believe that, and everything
else I said was meant to be
understood in that context.
2. I was assuming an emerging
agreement on this campus and
elsewhere that some kinds of
research are not appropriate to
the university, and it was in this
context that I suggested that if we
believe this, some criteria will be
needed for distinguishing, which
task I indicated is being
undertaken by the scientists
themselves. Any such decisions
mean some curtailment of
freedom to do just any kind of
research, and this was the context
of what must have seemed the

simplistic distinction between
"academic freedom" and "human
freedom." Both Professor Sands
and Rambo gave great help in
describing the spectrum along
which such intricate decisions
have to be made.
3. Some have apparently felt
that my comments were meant to
be inflammatory or divisive. Let
me state as clearly as I can: we are
past the time when the rhetoric of
emotion is sufficient ground for
discussion, or when the
attribution of "morality" only to
one's own position is defensible.
(This is why I disavowed the
appropriateness of the applause
with which I was at one point
interrupted.) If the opposite
impression has been conveyed to
those who were not there, I am
deeply sorry.

4. Our task now is to continue
the kind of exchange that was
experienced yesterday by so
many, and I hope we can stay on
the issues illuminated by the"Day
of Concern" rather than moving
into a new round of
confrontations that will always
carry the possibility of having to
call police or shutting down the
university, since such tactics will
surely now not only be
diversionary but will postpone if
not destroy the kinds of creative
directions in which Stanford can
now move.
This is a statement of faith in
the university reformed rather
than the university destroyed, and
I hope this campus can avoid
tactics that will jeopardize the
former for the sake of the latter.
