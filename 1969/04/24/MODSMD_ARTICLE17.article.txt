## Revolution: 'Only Logical Conclusion' 
### Lincoln Malik 
On April 18 at the Frost
Amphitheater, Gil Diaz asked
" . . .the various and assorted
liberation fronts a question, in
their great zeal to liberate people,
why don't you first ask them
whether they want to be
liberated?"
Those of you who were there
heard my angry response to the
question and remember my
closing remark in calling it a
stupid question. It is naturally a
stupid question from my point of
view as I have lived the reality of
my country, which is
representative of that in the Third
World. Given this reality, the
question of liberation becomes
synonymous with life and to ask
us whether we want liberty is
asking us if we want to live.
This is all Very clear and logical
to me, but I have come to
appreciate the problem of
American students trying to
materialize in their mind a picture
totally foreign to their experience.
They are constantly confronted
with pictures of Viet Nam and
Santo Domingo and other places
where the revolution has already
erupted and the U.S. is actively
engaged in putting it down. At
this stage of the game with the
deluge of U.S. government
propaganda drawing a picture of
an inhuman and savage
communist terrorist gang for the
liberation movement, it is not
suprising to see the resulting
confusion, where liberation is
confused with the freedom of
choice between communism and
capitalism, and counter
insurgency is confused with some
totally unrelated problem such as
the defense of democracy or
maintaining the security of the
U.S.
Nevertheless, if the same
person were to study any country
in the Third World that is still
dormant and its issues not yet
clouded with propaganda, would

realize immediately that far from
communist subversion or any
other awful, sinister thing, the
revolution is the only logical
conclusion to the present order of
things in the Third World.
A Instructions
One reason I hate to use words
such as the Third World,
exploitation, counter-insurgency,
etc., is because they become
abstractions almost immediately
after they are first used and are
totally useless in conveying a clear
and vivid picture of the reality
they are to represent.
What is it that we mean when
we say the Third World? These are
countries in this world where
people live. These are also
countries that are rich in resources
but poor in what they own,
underpopulated in comparison
with the industrialized countries
but without enough food to feed
their population; these are also
countries where the raw materials
are collected but none of the final
products are enjoyed.
This is what the Third World is,
a paradox of countries and people
that are rich in what they have,
yet poor in what they own, strong
in their potential, yet weak in
their present reality, defeated and
subjugated, yet resisting and
optimistic of a brighter future.
This brings us directly to
another term that has also ended
in the realm of abstractions,
revolution. Revolution in the
Third World is the condition
where after long years of
non-violent, struggle to solve the
paradox just described, people
have been forced to the use of
violence as the only alternative
left to effect meaningful change.
Revolutions do not happen
overnight nor are they imported,
exported, bought, sold, or
instigated. Revolutions are the
natural conclusion of political
struggle in the Third World.
It takes years of petitioning,

demonstrating, getting killed and
jailed and tortured before the
people finally decide that the only
way out is to confront force with
force and oppression with
revolution.
U.S.'s Role
The question now is, where
does the U.S. fit in all of this? I
could write about imperialism and
exploitation, but I am confronted
with those same evil forces that
were responsible for emptying all
those other words of their
meaning and shoving them in the
dictionary of abstract notions.
Hence, let us once more fall back
on the use of more descriptive
terminology.
The question that should pop
up immediately is: how is it
possible for these governments to
contain and repress such a vast
majority of the population? This
is a valid question, especially if we
realize that these governments are
in fact weak governments with
rather flimsy institutions and a
corrupt apparatus. They fully
represent in this manner the
backward reality of the countries
they rule.
In this context these
governments could not possibly
survive for very long in the face of
a rebellious population were it not
for as strong an ally as the U.S. I
would be rather absurd to think
that Papa "Doc" Dovalier could
survive in Haiti were it not for the
help of the U.S. The same is true
in dozens of countries in Asia,
Africa and Latin America.
Were we to ask why does the
U.S. assume this role of
supporting these bullies and thugs
in the Third World, I would say
because enough people who effect
policy in the U.S. find it in their
interest to do so. It is beyond
question that the U.S. is actively
supporting and helping perpetuate
these repressive governments in
the Third World. This is done
through financial and military aid

as well as through none other than |
that other member of the
fraternity of abstracted words:
counter-insurgency.
Counter-insurgency can take as I
many forms as there are '
situations. It can take the form of
training Cubans for the Bay of
Pigs invasion, rounding up of
mercenaries to fight against the
republicans in Yemen, transferring j
thousands of peasants in Viet
Nam from their villages to
controlled hamlets as well as
careful sociological studies in a
country to be used in fomenting
religious differences to shatter the
national unity and engaging the
people in religious wars against
each other keep them from
consolidating against the
government or the U.S. interests
in that country.
In all these cases the thing in
common is that a high degree of
expertise and science are used
against people who have
absolutely no means of protecting
themselves. We have to realize
that for every clever land reform
drawn up at SRI for use in
counter-insurgency, it takes years
for the peasants to realize that it
was actually a phony reform
designed to contain their rebellion
and defuse the situation for those
many years. The same is true of
every scheme of infiltrating
unions, drawing up of phony
constitutions, initiating superficial
reforms and all the rest of the
clever things that the scientists at
places such as SRI, Rand and the
CIA do.
It is such that the Third World
is pillaged, manipulated and
repressed; and this is why
everyone in the world is called
upon to rise up in outrage to the
defense of "the wretched of the
earth" —the people of the Third
World.
