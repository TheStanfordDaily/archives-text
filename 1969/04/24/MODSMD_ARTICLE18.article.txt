# Harvard Blacks Get Demand Vote On Faculty Selection
## 
### 
Black students at Harvard
University will be able to vote in
the selection of professors for a
proposed new black studies
program, by a vote of the faculty
of arts and sciences. Students have
never before had a direct voice in
the selection of faculty at
Harvard.
The decision of the faculty was
considered to be a victory for the

black students in their two-week
boycott attempting to establish a
black studies program with direct
student participation in its
formation.
The faculty approved a
resolution presented by the
Association of African and
Afro-American Students at
Harvard and Radcliffe by a vote
of 251 to 158. The most
controversial section was the one
providing for student
participation in choosing the
faculty members.
75 black students waited at
Loeb Drama Center, where the
faculty met, to hear the results of
the faculty vote. When the vote
was announced by the student
radio station, the students
cheered.
The same resolution also shows
the faculty's intention to make
the proposed Black Studies
program a full-fledged
department. An earlier proposal,

made in February, did not
establish a full Department of
Black Studies.
According to the resolution,
Harvard's standing Committee on
A fro-American Studies will
include three students chosen by
the black students' organization
and three other students planning
to study in the new department.
The committee is presently
composed of six faculty members
and is chaired by the dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences.
The new committee will be
able to nominate the first four of
six professors in the department.
Two of the professors will have
positions with tenure.
Many professors opposed the
student participation in selection
of faculty members because they
feared it would establish a
precedent for other departments
and because they felt that the
students did not have the training
to judge the faculty.
