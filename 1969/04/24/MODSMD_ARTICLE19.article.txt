# Joan Baez Here
## 
### 
Joan Baez will give a benefit
concert Sunday at 2 p.m. in Frost
Amphitheater.
The concert is being sponsored
by the Resistance at Stanford and
tickets for the show will be $1.00
per person.
Appearing with Miss Baez will
be Jeffrey Shurtleff,
singer-guitarist, and Kent Hudson
who will accompany on guitar.
The group has been appearing
throughout the country giving
benefits along with David Harris
for the Resistance. Harris, former
Stanford student body President,
is the founder of the Resistance.
According to Shurtleff, the
program they are planning
essentially involves trying to
"change the concept of concert

into a meeting," so that "people
got to get to know one another."
The concert then serves a dual
purpose of organizing as well as
entertainment.
The formal will be composed
of songs by both Shurtleff and
Baez, including some Dylan which
has not yet been recorded.
Tickets for the concert are
available in the Tresidder Union
Box Office, Town and Country
Music, Kepler's bookstore in Los
Altos and at the gate.
