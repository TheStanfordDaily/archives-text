# Slowness In Review Might Stagnate SES
## 
### BILL BANKS News Analysis 
There are indications that the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES) is being
studied into stagnation by the Academic
Senate and the Student Education
Council (SEC).
To date, according to Sally Main,
Director of Research for SES, no SES
proposals have been passed by the
Senate.
The proposals are discussed one by
one at a joint session of the Academic
Senate and the SEC. These groups meet
jointly once every two weeks, though
they convene separately every week.
Most of the SES recommendations
have been printed for distribution to the
students and faculty. Three of the
reports, according to Miss Main, have
not yet been made available due to
difficulties in printing processes. These
three are: "Teaching, Research, and the
Faculty," "Study Abroad," and"The
Extra-Curriculum."
Victor von Schlegell, who heads the
SEC, said of the proceedings, "We're
going way too slowly." In an effort to
speed up the process, the SEC has been
broken down into committees which
will form concise statements about each
report.
Committees Working
The SEC committees are now
working specifically on the reports on
undergraduate admissions, study
abroad, the university government and
advising and counseling.
Miss Main, who also commented that
"The implementation process is very
slow," expressed doubts that the reports
would be fully considered by the end of
the spring quarter.
At the same time, she announced
that report number VII on Graduate
Education has been printed and is now
available to the community.
Much Debate
The drooping pace of the SES
proceedings is apparently due to the
laborious examination given each

report. The many facets of the reports
give rise to much debate in the joint
meetings.
A further hindrance to these
processes was suggested by von
Schlegell. He stated that the debates
were far from exciting and that "many
faculty members just stopped showing
up" (for the meetings).
A further explanation for the
"slowdown" was offered by Professor
David Grey of the Communications
Department. He suggested that recent
campus disruptions might be, in part,
responsible for the confusion and delay.
Grey said that proposals were being
"pushed aside" by the more pressing
matter of disruption. "SES is taking a
beating," he said, and then described in
detail how work in his department had
been effected by disruptions.
Grey suggested that many functions
of the unive.sity had been similarly
effected and expressed the opinion that
"Not much will be done (about SES)
before next year."
