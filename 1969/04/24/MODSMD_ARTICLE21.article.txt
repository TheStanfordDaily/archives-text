# 200 Leaders Sign Refusal
## 
### 
Over 200 student leaders have
declared that they will refuse
induction into the armed forces
for as long as the Vietnam war
continues.
ASSU President Denis Hayes is
among the signers. Hayes was
contacted last summer about
signing such a declaration and
agreed to do so. Just last week he
was checked again to see if he had
changed his mind. He had not.
Daily Editor Philip Taubman

was contacted last February, but
d i d not agree to sign the
declaration.
The students, many of whom
are from the nation's great
universities, declared they will
"refuse induction and aid and
support those who decide to
refuse." The signers are either
student body presidents or
campus editors.
Harvard, Berkeley, UCLA,
Amherst, Johns Hopkins, Yale,
Princeton, University of
Maryland, MIT, and the
Universities of Oklahoma and
Wisconsin are represented.
However, the majority of signers
were from smaller colleges such as
Knoxville and Bethune-Cookman.
The declaration also petitions
President Nixon for an audience,
but the White House has made no
comment as of yet.
The letter to the President said
"We now must number ourselves
among those students who cannot
at this time square military duty
with integrity and conscience."
"There is a time," siad Roger
Black, editor of the University of
Chicago's Maroon, "when you
have to stand up against what you
believe is very gravely damaging to
your countryâ€”in resisting the
draft and refusing to participate in
an unjust and immoral war, I am
taking that stand now."
The declaration movement was

organized by David Hawk, a draft
resister and staffer of the National
Students Association. He and
other signers participated in a
press conference at which all
present said that they faced great
difficulty in making their
decision. Refusing induction
carries a maximum five-year
penalty.
However, George Curry of
Knoxville, the lone black in the
group, said, "After a thorough
examination of my conscience, I
had only one choice: complete
refusal to enter the armed
forces . . .Under no circumstances
will I enter. Given the choice of
jail or war, I'll serve my time in
jail."
Allard Lowenstein, New York
Representative who spoke
recently at Stanford, summed up
for students after they read their
declarations of conscience, saying
the students were "elected
representatives of a whole
generation of college students"
who are weary of the war and
have come to believe it as
immoral.
Also sending support was
Senator Mark Hatfield of Oregon,
who didn't agree with breaking
the law but hoped that the nation
wouldn't ignore the integrity of
their decision or the agony of
their action."
