# Raskin To Talk On Ties With Military
## 
### 
Marcus Raskin, well known
author and a former special
assistant in the Kennedy
Administration, will speak tonight
on "The Military and the
University."
Raskin is currently co-director
of the Institute for Policy Studies
in Washington. Previously he
served as assistant to McGeorge
Bundy with the title "Special
Assistant on Disarmament."

In 1967 Raskin was indicted
with Dr. Benjamin Spock, William
Sloane Coffin, and two others for
conspiracy relating to work the
men had done in opposition to
the draft and the Vietnam War.
Raskin was the only one of the
five to be found not guilty. The
others are currently awaiting
court sentencing.
Last summer Raskin served as
temporary chairman of the New
Party, organized as an alternative
on the left to the established
party structures. He has continued
his activity in the party, but has
relinqueshed its leadership to Dick
Gregory and James Dixon,
President of Antioch College.
Raskin will speak at 8:00
tonight in room 274 of Tresidder
Memorial Union. He will spend
the day in Berkeley, addressing a
student rally there earlier in the
day. His plans also include an
address to members of the April 3
Movement on Friday.
