## Act At Foothill 
### 
"America: Black and White," a
condensation of "In White
America," will be presented by
the American Conservatory
Theatre Thursday (April 24) at 1
p.m. in the Foothill College
Theatre, Los Altos Hills. The
public performance is sponsored
by the Foothill College Black
Student Union and the Office of
Community Services.
The production is a
documentary drama, presenting a

series of actual dramatic episodes
dealing with blacks. Episodes are
taken from letters, diaries,
government records, and
newspaper accounts.
Incidents and documents are
presented in near-chronological
order but are woven by a
dramatist's, rather than a
historian's sense of logic.
Demonstrating that slavery was
not totally accepted, a Quaker
woman is portrayed trying to get
a petition to the Congress to
abolish slavery. An actor
portraying Thomas Jefferson
comes to the conclusion that the
blacks are inferior to the whites in
both body and mind.

Many of the depicted incidents j
are not in history books. These I
include the slave rebellions, a j
World War II account about white
American Gl's shooting on black
American Gl's, and an interview j
with Woodrow Wilson in which he j
emerges as less than a liberal. A ;
dramatic episode shows the j
conflict in philosophy between
Booker T. Washington and W.E.B.
Dußois at the turn of the century.
The ACT company of
"America: Black and White"
includes Christopher Payne and j
John Hancock, among other
actors. Tickets are available for $1 j
