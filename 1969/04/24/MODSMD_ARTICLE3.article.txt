# Classified Papers Moved From AEL
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
About 20 per cent of the classified
documents in the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) were removed
yesterday afternoon under heavy
security guard for storage in an
off-campus location.
Primarily those classified items which
had been stored on open shelves in
locked rooms were taken. Some filing
cabinets were also taken out and put in
a van-type truck which was one-third
full when it left, according to witnesses.
The documents were removed by
AEL security chief, Robert Simmons,
acting on orders from President
Kenneth S. Pitzer. The documents will
reportedly remain under University
control.
The move was made to "reduce any
chance of accidental compromising of
this information," according to a
University News Service release. This
presumably refers to the possibility of
re-occupation of the building by the
April 3rd Movement. They are planning
to hold a mass meeting Friday to
coincide with the reopening of the
laboratory which has been kept closed
by Pitzer this week.
Minor Damage
Although no official estimate of
damage has been made by AEL officials,
a survey of the building by Daily

reporters at the end of the occupation
showed relatively minor damage,
considering the length and magnitude of
the sit-in.
There were paint or ink marks on
three doors, writing on walls or landings
of the back stairway, rubber stamp and
chalk markings on the walls of room
214, and paint on some of the second
floor windows.
Room 16, occupied by the United
Students Movement (USM), a high
school group, was a shambles; papers
were strewn about the inner and outer
office and there was extensive writing
on the walls.
A three-inch hole in the wall of room
six was also discovered. It is not known
whether or not it was there before the
sit-in began.
A plastic model of an Sit-71
high-altitude "spy" plane was
destroyed.
The extent to which the roof of the
AEL was damaged is not known,
however, the protective covering of
rocks has been scraped away in several
spots exposing large areas of tarpaper.
"Missing" Items
Releases published by AEL
employees allege that several personal
items, including a camera, radio and
dictaphone are missing from the
building. There has been no
confirmation of this, however. Two
graduate student theses have also been
reported missing.
Spot checks by the Daily indicate
that the building has remained locked
and generally unoccupied during the
week with the exception of security
guards stationed inside.
Almost all the blinds on the first
floor have been drawn; however, empty
offices with pad locked file cabinets are
still visible. Posters saying "We're Sitting
in at AEL, Join Us" remain on the side
of the building.
Employees and researchers, not
permitted inside the laboratory without
special permission, are continuing to
operate out of the McCullough
Electrical Engineering Building across
from the AEL.
