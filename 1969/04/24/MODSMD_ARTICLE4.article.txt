# At Clubhouse
## April 3 Group Resettles 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
At the Clubhouse, new headquarters
of the April 3rd Movement, "the
facilities are great, but the politics are
nil," stated law student Doron
Weinberg.
"The comfort, the number of offices
available, and the physical make-up," he
explained, "are much better here than
over at AEL.
"But we lack the previous drama of
having a sit-in and the political
education of participants that had been
taking place."
Invited by the United Campus
Christian Ministry (UCCM) who
permanently shares the Clubhouse with
several other groups, the April 3rd
Movement has been given access to a
number of rooms and facilities there in
which to organize activities.
Decorations
Mounting the stairs of the
Clubhouse, one can see, "Everything
that rises must converge," painted on a
door, and tacked on another door
leading to an outside porch is a sign
which reads, "Roof area reserved for
practice of levitation."
There might even be a person on the
couch, wrapped in an unclaimed
sleeping bag, who is snoring and
seemingly oblivious to any thoughts of
converging, levitating, or even rising.
Most of the movement's volunteers,
however, have much work to
accomplish, even though Weinberg
described the current situation as "a
period of waiting when there's relatively
little to do."
Sounds
Amid the sounds of a banjo, a dog,
several typewriters, and a ditto machine,
the members of the coordinating
committee discuss tactics, issues, and
current business.
Although the rooms of the

Clubhouse have not been renamed, as
those at AEL were, in honor of such
leaders as Malcolm X and Eldridge
Cleaver, the students have decorated
walls with sayings from Marx and Mao
Tse-Tung and an occasional sign
declaring, "this lounge is available for
occupation."
Sophomore Mike Lindemann
admitted that he spends from 10 to 12
hours over at the Clubhouse helping the
Movement.
Fewer Active
"One problem that exists now,"
Weinberg noted, "is that fewer people
are actively involved" at the Clubhouse
than at AEL.
"The drama involved in holding AEL
acted as a unifying force." "The
creation of this unifying force,"he
added, "is one of the strongest
arguments for having a sit-in.
"During this week, too," Weinberg
continued, "we've had to spend more
time talking to the campus about the
movement."
Weinberg is pleased with the number
of students that show up to help with
the movement's business, adding that
"we want the Clubhouse to be a place
where the students cannot only come
and work but also sit around and discuss
things with each other."
No Press
One of the major inconveniences of
being located in the Clubhouse is the
lack of a printing press.
"We haven't been able to constantly
print leaflets and statements like we
could during the sit-in in order to keep
the community better informed of our
actions."
Leaflets are currently being produced
on a ditto machine, but paper is
extremely scarce.
"We've been trying all week to get
some printing equipment," lamented

Weinberg, "but we absolutely can't use
University facilities."
Despite rumors that a number of
UCCM people resent the presence of the
movement, the groups seem to be
co-existing without apparent difficulty.
People 'Friendly'
"The people here are not the
enemy," remarked SDS member
Leonard Siegel with a grin, "so we have
to cooperate with them."
"The natives are usually pretty
friendly, however," he added. "We've
had no problems with the regular
workers," Weinberg agreed.
The director of the UCCM has given
the Movement no maximum limit to
their "occupation" of the Clubhouse,
and Weinberg stated that the length of
their stay "depends on the outcome of
coming events."
"Who knows?" added Siegel, "we
may be located in another building
before long."
