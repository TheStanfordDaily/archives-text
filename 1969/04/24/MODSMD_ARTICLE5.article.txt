# Pitzer Sends Letter To Faculty
## 
### 
The following letter was released last night at 10:30 by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer to all members of the Academic
Council:
To All Members of the Academic Council:
I want to thank you once again for the support that you
expressed Friday for the manner in which the sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory was handled. Your action
has reinforced my determination to deal with future
disruptions as far as possible through the University's own
processes.
In this undertaking, I appreciate the invaluable work,
done at considerable personal sacrifice, by the Stanford
Judicial Council under the chairmanship of Professor Jack
Friedenthal, and by the Faculty Consultative Group on
Campus Disruptions. The Council's findings were
instrumental in ending the sit-in, and its suggestions remain
the most effective sanctions that we have for the internal
solution of any new campus disruptions.
As I indicated Friday, I have accepted and put into effect
the Council's findings and suggestions. This means that if any
major disruption occurs during the remainder of the Quarter,
it will be dealt with in the same manner as proposed in the
case of the Laboratory sit-in, a procedure that I intend to
initiate promptly should the situation require. This includes
the use of immediate, temporary suspension of students, and
immediate, temporary suspension of salary for faculty and
staff, to be in effect until hearings before the Stanford
Judicial Council can be held, in the event of unauthorized
occupation of University buildings.
In this connection, the Judicial Countil action can be
effective only if members of the campus community
cooperate in persuading demonstrators to end their
disruptions, and in assisting in the identification of
individuals engaged in such acts. I trust that your action of
last Friday is an indication of your willingness to assume a
part of this responsibility.
That there will be another difficult moment this spring
appears likely. Certain members of the "April 3rd
Movement" continue to insist that the campus community
act precipitously and in a manner that they prescribe. Under

these ground rules, the suggestion that complex issues be
studied thoughtfully and thoroughly is regarded as a delaying
tactic, and questions as to the propriety or physical coercion
on the campus are viewed as an evasion of the "basic issues."
The issues associated with the Stanford-SRI relationship
and the broader question of classified research on the campus
are very important. Appropriate groups had studies, or were
studying, those questions before the sit-in began. I believe we
can honestly say that the Senate of the Academic Council is
moving expeditiously toward decisions or recommendations.
In addition, I also have not hesitated to make clear my own
position on certain issues - both local and national—a position
which often coincided with that of most concerned students.
Having done so, I would call attention to another issue
which should be of equal concern to this community: the
threat which coercion represents to the continued existence
of the university as a center for open inquiry and free speech.
This has become tragically apparent on other campuses in
recent days. It is present in the implied threats which have
accompanied—and still accompany—specific demands on this
campus.
In their zeal to convert all members of the University to
their point of view, some members of the community
apparently have rationalized the infringement of the rights of
others, have condoned the interference with personal and
private property, and have threatened further disruptions if
their demands are not met.
As a result, we face on this campus a clear test of the
University's commitment and capacity to govern its own
affairs. The response of the Stanford Judicial Council and of
the Academic Council of the University at its meeting last
Friday gives strong evidence that the commitment and the
capacity exist. I sincerely hope that we can remain a center
of reason against forces of coercion, whether from without
or from within, and that each of us will continue to stand
behind the internal judicial procedures upon which all
constituencies have agreed. Only in this manner can we
protect the rights of all to teach, to study, and to work in
freedom.
Kenneth S. Pitwr
