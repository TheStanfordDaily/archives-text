# Voting Ends Today In Presidential Election
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Late tonight Stanford will have a
new student body president.
The candidates, Pat Shea and his
Council of Presidents and Bob Cory
have waged a basically low key
campaign. Each candidate has plastered
the walls of the dormitories with
broadsides and covered the bathrooms
until finding the urinals has become
nearly impossible. But the election
seems to have taken a back seat to other
things on campus.
The main issue of the campaign has
become the Council of Presidents. It's
an issue which the candidates have
devised themselves, and am issue which
was non-existent before the campaign
began. Conceivably if they were not
running it would not even be an issue.
But beyond that, Cory has supported
the creation of an Urban and

Commentary

candidates finally began, the most hotly
contested point seemed to be the matter
of whether Bob Mattson, who was
eliminated in the primary, had actually
endorsed Bob Cory or not. In a letter to
The Daily Mattson stated he had
endorsed neither.
Aside from that, Shea concentrated
on accomplishments of members of his
ticket and possibilities of a four man
presidency.
Shea has stated that he has been
avoiding addressing issues specifically
because of the fact that his
commitments on various committees
would possibly damage negotiations. He
also maintains that the reason he has
refrained for the most part from
printing short position papers is because
it would not do justice to his stands on
widely complex issues.
In campaign literature Cory has
stated that funds should be provided to
allow several organizations to print
newsletters. He has favored abolition of
all university requirements save the
basic 180 units etc.
These stands among others have been
widely distributed with short paragraphs
on the issues, but with little elaboration
on each.
There has been some discussion on
classifying Cory as a conservative and
Shea as a liberal. But the labels have
been batted about in such a way that
accuracy is relative. It seems an
irrelevancy anyway. Stands on common
issues seem essentially similar.
So today one of them will be elected
and the election process will have been
satisfied for another year. The long
campaign will finally come to a close. It
came in on the skirts of a sit-in and it
may leave in a similar fashion. Whatever,
the case, its passing will be quickly
forgotten.

Environmental bludies Department, the
adoption of "an individually designed
academic program" for each student,
and reallocating publication funds from
the Stanford Daily to other
organizations on campus.
Structural Approach
Shea and his running-mates have
concentrated on the structure of their
ticket, and the accomplishments of its
members. But they have come out for
making SRI into a graduate research
university, the stepping up of solutions
for housing on campus, and speeding up
discussions and action on SES.
On the issue of the sit-in, Shea was in
favor of a limited sit-in as opposed to an
unlimited one. Cory was against the
sit-in altogether saying that he felt "the
timing was not right."
Both maintain that they made
frequent trips to AEL after the sit-in
began.
The two finally met in debate

meeting before a small audience in

Structural Approach
Shea and his running-mates have
concentrated on the structure of their
ticket, and the accomplishments of its
members. But they have come out for
making SRI into a graduate research
university, the stepping up of solutions
for housing on campus, and speeding up
discussions and action on SES.
On the issue of the sit-in, Shea was in
favor of a limited sit-in as opposed to an
unlimited one. Cory was against the
sit-in altogether saying that he felt "the
timing was not right."
Both maintain that they made
frequent trips to AEL after the sit-in
began.
The two finally met in debate
Tuesday night in an unpublicized
meeting before a small audience in
Branner Dining Hall.
Campaign Spiel
Each made a short campaign spiel to
onlookers before answering questions.

Late tonight Stanford will have a
new student body president.
The candidates, Pat Shea and his
Council of Presidents and Bob Cory
have waged a basically low key
campaign. Each candidate has plastered
the walls of the dormitories with
broadsides and covered the bathrooms
until finding the urinals has become
nearly impossible. But the election
seems to have taken a back seat to other
things on campus.
The main issue of the campaign has
become the Council of Presidents. It's
an issue which the candidates have
devised themselves, and am issue which
was non-existent before the campaign
began. Conceivably if they were not
running it would not even be an issue.
But beyond that, Cory has supported
the creation of an Urban and

Commentary

candidates finally began, the most hotly
contested point seemed to be the matter
of whether Bob Mattson, who was
eliminated in the primary, had actually
endorsed Bob Cory or not. In a letter to
The Daily Mattson stated he had
endorsed neither.
Aside from that, Shea concentrated
on accomplishments of members of his
ticket and possibilities of a four man
presidency.
Shea has stated that he has been
avoiding addressing issues specifically
because of the fact that his
commitments on various committees
would possibly damage negotiations. He
also maintains that the reason he has
refrained for the most part from
printing short position papers is because
it would not do justice to his stands on
widely complex issues.
In campaign literature Cory has
stated that funds should be provided to
allow several organizations to print
newsletters. He has favored abolition of
all university requirements save the
basic 180 units etc.
These stands among others have been
widely distributed with short paragraphs
on the issues, but with little elaboration
on each.
There has been some discussion on
classifying Cory as a conservative and
Shea as a liberal. But the labels have
been batted about in such a way that
accuracy is relative. It seems an
irrelevancy anyway. Stands on common
issues seem essentially similar.
So today one of them will be elected
and the election process will have been
satisfied for another year. The long
campaign will finally come to a close. It
came in on the skirts of a sit-in and it
may leave in a similar fashion. Whatever,
the case, its passing will be quickly
forgotten.
