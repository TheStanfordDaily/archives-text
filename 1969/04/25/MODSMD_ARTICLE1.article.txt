# Academic Senate Bans Secret Research; Shea Ticket Victorious In ASSU Election
## Faculty Meets 6 Hours 
### 
In a marathon six-hour meeting
yesterday, the Academic Senate
approved a sweeping ban on secret
research at Stanford.
The new legislation will affect all 12
of Stanford's classified research
programs. Several contracts at the
Applied Electronics Lab, the target of
last week's sit-in, are included. (Text of
legislation appears on this page.)
Before the Senate's meeting, Dean
Joseph Pettit of the engineering school
announced that he had decided to phase
out all classified work in engineering,
regardless of the Senate's decision.
In a letter to President Pitzer
(reprinted on page two of today's
Daily), Pettit warns against enacting
"unworkable and repressive legislation,
together with cumbersome ''.nd
autocratic centralized enforcement
procedures "
Pettit Complains
Pettit complains that "the community
seems unable to assure an adequate
minimum of protection to faculty
offices, personal files and property, and
I have serious doubts as to the safety of
classified documents." He told Pitzer
that "the Stanford community is in a
crisis of civil government," and that his
phase-out of secret work was intended
to "help free you and the Senate to
direct "our immediate attention to it."
Pettit also cites "the evident loss of
faculty support necessary for the
pursuit of this (classified) activity in a
university."
Pettit's letter was read to the Senate
at the start of yesterday's meeting,
according to observers. Then the Senate
went ahead to consider the new
legislation drawn up by the Committee
on Research Policy, chaired by law
professor William F. Baxter. The
Committee's version was passed with
some changes.
According to a University
spokesman, the Senate "unanimously
expressed its confidence" in Pitzer and
Pettii to work with the faculty "to
achieve an effective transition" to the
new rules.
No CBW Ban
The Senate did not act on the
questions of a ban on
chemical-biological warfare or
counterinsurgency research. No such
research now goes on at the University,
according to University officials, but the
April 3rd Movement, sponsor of the
recent sit-in, has demanded an explicit
prohibition here and at SRI.
The policy adopted yesterday begins
with a general resolution that "no
program of research that requires
secrecy (as hereafter defined) be
conducted at Stanford University."
Secrecy is then defined in three
ways:
1. Secrecy in documents which
establish the project or describe
applications;
2. Existence of a "reasonable basis
for expectation" that the research will
generate documents that will be
classified; or
3. A need for security clearances for
researchers.
Some important exceptions are
given. Specifically, security clearances
for some members of a research project
are permitted as long as the classified
information involved is "peripheral" to

the research, so that "a member of the
research group who did not hold a
security clearance would nevertheless be
able to participate fully in all of the
intellectually significant portions of the
project."
Baxter, in discussing this exception,
has used the example of the secret
launching data for a space probe. The
new legislation will not prevent
researchers from gaining access to such
incidental classified information.
Other exceptions to the general rules
concern secrecy to protect individual
privacy, foreign patents, confidential
information given by private persons,
and autobiographical data.
The Senate's legislation asks for an
annual review of research policy in open
meetings of the Committee on Research
Policy.
The Senate's action last night
culminated a whirlwind of activity that
began with the series of demands issued
April 3 by a mass meeting of students
and faculty.
Soon afterwards, Pitzer asked Baxter
to hold a special session of his
committee to reconsider Stanford's
policy on secret research. Pitzer had
taken a public stand against secret
research on campus.

to hold a special session of his

taken a public stand against secret
research on campus.


WINNERS—Joyce Kobayashi and Pat Shea, members of the Council of Presidents, smile after
scoring a slim victory over Bob Cory in the ASSU presidential election. John Grube and Harry
Askinas are the two other members of the Shea ticket.
In a marathon six-hour meeting
yesterday, the Academic Senate
approved a sweeping ban on secret
research at Stanford.
The new legislation will affect all 12
of Stanford's classified research
programs. Several contracts at the
Applied Electronics Lab, the target of
last week's sit-in, are included. (Text of
legislation appears on this page.)
Before the Senate's meeting, Dean
Joseph Pettit of the engineering school
announced that he had decided to phase
out all classified work in engineering,
regardless of the Senate's decision.
In a letter to President Pitzer
(reprinted on page two of today's
Daily), Pettit warns against enacting
"unworkable and repressive legislation,
together with cumbersome ''.nd
autocratic centralized enforcement
procedures "
Pettit Complains
Pettit complains that "the community
seems unable to assure an adequate
minimum of protection to faculty
offices, personal files and property, and
I have serious doubts as to the safety of
classified documents." He told Pitzer
that "the Stanford community is in a
crisis of civil government," and that his
phase-out of secret work was intended
to "help free you and the Senate to
direct "our immediate attention to it."
Pettit also cites "the evident loss of
faculty support necessary for the
pursuit of this (classified) activity in a
university."
Pettit's letter was read to the Senate
at the start of yesterday's meeting,
according to observers. Then the Senate
went ahead to consider the new
legislation drawn up by the Committee
on Research Policy, chaired by law
professor William F. Baxter. The
Committee's version was passed with
some changes.
According to a University
spokesman, the Senate "unanimously
expressed its confidence" in Pitzer and
Pettii to work with the faculty "to
achieve an effective transition" to the
new rules.
No CBW Ban
The Senate did not act on the
questions of a ban on
chemical-biological warfare or
counterinsurgency research. No such
research now goes on at the University,
according to University officials, but the
April 3rd Movement, sponsor of the
recent sit-in, has demanded an explicit
prohibition here and at SRI.
The policy adopted yesterday begins
with a general resolution that "no
program of research that requires
secrecy (as hereafter defined) be
conducted at Stanford University."
Secrecy is then defined in three
ways:
1. Secrecy in documents which
establish the project or describe
applications;
2. Existence of a "reasonable basis
for expectation" that the research will
generate documents that will be
classified; or
3. A need for security clearances for
researchers.
Some important exceptions are
given. Specifically, security clearances
for some members of a research project
are permitted as long as the classified
information involved is "peripheral" to

the research, so that "a member of the
research group who did not hold a
security clearance would nevertheless be
able to participate fully in all of the
intellectually significant portions of the
project."
Baxter, in discussing this exception,
has used the example of the secret
launching data for a space probe. The
new legislation will not prevent
researchers from gaining access to such
incidental classified information.
Other exceptions to the general rules
concern secrecy to protect individual
privacy, foreign patents, confidential
information given by private persons,
and autobiographical data.
The Senate's legislation asks for an
annual review of research policy in open
meetings of the Committee on Research
Policy.
The Senate's action last night
culminated a whirlwind of activity that
began with the series of demands issued
April 3 by a mass meeting of students
and faculty.
Soon afterwards, Pitzer asked Baxter
to hold a special session of his
committee to reconsider Stanford's
policy on secret research. Pitzer had
taken a public stand against secret
