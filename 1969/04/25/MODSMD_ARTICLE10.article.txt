# Letters To The Editor
## French Student Is Fabrication 
### 
Editor,THE DAILY:
As a present member of the
ASSU, I am of the opinion that
Andre Maupain is a fabrication. If
he really existed, his letter in
yesterday's Daily would not have
been signed by his name alone. He
would have indicated which
organization he represented, or at
least where he could be found.
I suggest that whichever group
is behind the aforementioned
letter take a collection among its
members to pay for a phon.r call
to the UNEF in Paris (326-8601).
Such a call, costing only nine
dollars, would provide final
information about the legitimacy
of the telegram of solidarity sent
by the National Union of French

Students to the April Third
Coalition.

busy, I would advise him to sue
the real or fictitious Mr. Maupain
for libel.)
•In Response
Editor, THE DAILY:
I must take issue with
Professor Robert M. Brown. His
letter printed in Thursday's Daily
indicates a very false notion about
rational discussion and its
relationship to power politics.
It is wrong to assume that
serious rational discussion about
things that really matter ever
takes place in a political vacuum.
Tremendous power and massive
vested interests are already
profoundly present in the issues
being discussed on campus.
Indeed, they were not
discussed very much at all,
rationally or irrationally, until the
April 3rd Coalition mounted a
serious challenge to the power
interests (The Board of Trustees,
most of the administration and
much of the faculty) that have a
significant stake in preserving the
status quo.
When Professor Brown urges
the Coalition to lay off for a while
he is saying, in effect, "Remove
your application of power from

the discussion in order that the
other side may contribute its
power and interests unchallenged.
In that way, 'rational' discussion
can go on." And when he
combines this with a concern
about those who would "destroy
the University," he strengthens
the hand of the very people who
are most likely to bring about a
decision quite the opposite from
the demands of the Coalition he
claims to support.
