# Dear Mom
## Another Scoop By "Mom" 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom, I didn't take the
AEL protesters seriously until I
passed UGLY yesterday and
noticed workmen moving
ominous equipment out of the
basement. On investigation, I
noted intense activity in the
basement. Why the blowtorches?
What are those sinister metal
cannisters? Why is the basement
always locked? Why signs reading,
''Disregard unavoidable
construction noise." What in the
hell are they assembling down
there?
Suspiciously Terrified,
Doug Dashner

Dear Suspiciously Terrified Doug,
MIST (Mother's committee for
Instalations Suspiciously
Terifying) investigated your
allegations. As the photograph
testifies, Mother was also
suspiciously terrified. MIST has
proven that these are indeed
dow-xener cryogenic isolator
panels. I'm certainly not letting
the children near the Library, and
I advise all students to stay away,
too!
MlSTically,
