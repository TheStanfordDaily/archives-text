# From The Ivory Tower
## Morality And The University 
### Paul Ehrlich 
To me the only important
"moral" questions have to do
with the condition of the 3 1 /2
billion human beings who now
occupy our planet, and the many
billion more who soon may be
added to that number. Will they
be well fed? Will they have good
housing? Will they have personal
dignity and a secure role in their
society? Will they have competent
medical care? Will they live in fear
of death from thermonuclear or
biological warfare? Will they
suffer deprivation because of the
color of their skin? Will they be
free to "do their own thing?"
It is the job of every one of us
not only to attempt to improve
the condition of our fellow men,
but also to apply careful scrutiny
to our standards of just what
"improvement" is. When we have
achieved some level of consensus
on these moral decisions, then we
must go on to take the political
action necessary to implement
them.
Quality of Life
Incredible as it may seem, very
little attention has been paid to
questions concerning how many
people, with what quality of life,
this planet can support for various
periods of time, and under
different technological
assumptions.
It is clear to me that the
amount of » "good" (however
defined) available to some
one-half or two-thirds of the
population of this globe is today
inadequate. The reasons are
complex, and are compounded of
such factors as absolute shortages
of food and raw materials, grave
(and immoral) inequities in their
distribution, and stresses placed
on the life support systems of the
planet due to human
overpopulation.
It is important to note that not
only is the population absolutely
too large, it has a rate of growth
which would lead to a lowered
quality of life even if the absolute
size were considerably lower. It is
even more important to remember
that environmental problems
created by overpopulation are
probably a threat to human health
and survival equal to that of food
shortage.
It is commonplace to assume
that overpopulation is a problem
caused by Indians and South
Americans, but in actuality
population growth in the United
States is probably the most
serious and destructive in the
world. We are the champion
consumers, exploiters, and
polluters of all time. The birth of
each American baby represents a
threat to the survival of our
species which is perhaps two
dozen times as serious as that
posed by an Indian child. But
there is some ironic justice.
Should mankind survive the next
two decades, the standard of
living of the average Asian peasant
will have changed much less than
that of the average American.
We've got a much longer way to
fall.
I strongly feel that morality
begins at home. We should be
deeply concerned with what goes
on in the Stanford community.
We should strive to make that
community the embodiment of
our ideals. But we must be certain

that in an attempt to make
Stanford 99 and 44/100's percent
pure we do not destroy its
effectiveness as an agency of
change within our society and the
world as a whole. It would be
criminally selfish if in order to
secure our own moral comfort we
caused repercussions which
injured other people far from
Stanford. While we work with our
neighbors and colleagues we must
not lose sight of the big picture. I
have no patience with the "Pope
Pauls" of the world who will
sacrifice others on the altar of
their own moral rightousness.
In the real world, moral
decisions are not usually clean cut
and easy to make. Let me give
you an example from personal
experience. Black militants often
claim that population control (or
family planning) is a white
plot —that essentially it is a mask
for genocide. Because of my
association with population
control I've been accused of being
a racist. To an extent the militants
correctly estimate the motives of
some of the population control
movement. My guess is that about
1/3 of all those people who
advocate population control
actually mean control Blacks, or
the poor, not the white or the
affluent.
Quality Not Quantity
To that extent population
control is a white racist plot. Like
other racist plots, this one shows a
characteristic stupidity. Nothing
would add more to Black Power
than the economic and
sociological benefits which would
accrue to smaller Black families.
Far from hurting the Blacks, the
racists are pushing a program that
can only help them. Quality is
what counts in the world today,
not quantity.
So I have made what I think is
the moral decision—to continue in
the population control movement
in spite of some strange
bedfellows. I hope to focus more
attention on the most serious
culprits—the executives, doctors,
professors, and their ilk who are,
even in 1969, producing third and
fourth children. These children
will grow up to be master

polluters and consumers, a fate
denied most Black children.
In short I feel the goal of
population control transcends the
ignorant motives of some of its
adherents. I would not attempt to
instantly "purify" the movement
at the risk of destroying it. I'd
rather bear the burden of being
called a racist than give up what I
think is a fight to save millions, if
not billions, of people from
misery.
I am much more distressed
about the relative lack of "peace
research" at Stanford than I am
by the presence of war research. I
would like an organization with
which I am associated to be in the
forefront of helping mankind, and
I think Stanford can do a lot
better than it is doing. I would
like to see more research like that
of Professor Robert North into
the causes of wars, and the ways
of preventing them.
I wish that my medical
colleagues were all like Dr.
Richard Lee and fighting at the
forefront for abortion reform. I
wish that more of my scientific
colleagues would, like Professor
Lederberg, express themselves in
the public media. And I say that
even though Lederberg and I
often disagree. Remember, under
our system he has a right to be
wrong!
In general I think it is
important for the entire
community to concern itself with
the kinds of research which are
carried out at Stanford. I am not
yet clear, however, how far
beyond community moral
sanction we should be prepared to
go in enforcing consensus.
Certainly research with classified
output must cease—even moral
sanctions must be applied on a
basis of knowledge.
But a Pandora's Box lies
beyond that point. Is it just
research that we limit, or do we
go on to speech? What does one
do about an electrical engineer
who makes silly statements about
race? What about an English
professor who through either
abyssmal ignorance or religious
adherence to political dogma
declares there is no population

problem? After all, should that
professor convince an army of
ignoramuses that he was right, he
would pose a much greater threat
to every man, woman, and child
on this planet than 100 SRI
scientists working on
counter-insurgency weapons,
should the community vote bans
of silence against these
gentlemen? Or is their error so
transparent as to he harml pc« 9
While these issues are being
aired, I am sure the point will be
repeatedly raised that, whatever
our moral position, we will be
unable to operate politically
within the system in order to
achieve the necessary goals. The
claim will be that letter writing,
protesting, and voting won't get
the job done. There is, in my
opinion, considerable validity to
that point of view. There is every
sign that the system socializes
those who get involved with it
(after all, I drive a car and fly an
airplane, and am thus a
contributor to the pollution I
always claim to be fighting).
But discussions of the
destruction of our present
institutions, and of what they
should be replaced with, are
beside the point. The time is too
short. If we don't solve our
problems by working through (or
modifying) our current
institutions, disaster will surely
overtake us. You should keep in
mind that the Universities, almost
alone, represent the institutional
hope of mankind. They are the
prime source of nuclear test ban
treaties resistance to the ABM,
CBW, and the Viet Nam war.
Universities because they are
relatively free are also relatively
fragile.
Society, through the mindless
Right on the outside and the
defiantly "know-nothing" Left on
the inside can easily destroy the
universities. If that occurs I think
Homo sapiens will have blown its
last slim chance of survival.
