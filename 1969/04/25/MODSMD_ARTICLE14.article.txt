# From The Ivory Tower
## SRI's Value To The University 
### William K. Linvill 
The Stanford community,
comprising the University and SRI
working symbiotically, potentially
provides a unique resource in our
country to combine the
exploratory research of the
university and the implementive
R&D of the institute. The specific
formal institutional relationship
between Stanford University and
Stanford Research Institute
appears to be secondary in
importance. My concern is that
this period of well-meaning but
overheated discussion may

polarize and thereby separate
these two components of the
Stanford community, who simply
must work together for each to be
effective.
The basic moral issue on
Vietnam war research is to
determine the proper relationship
of the richest and most powerful
nation on the earth to the
impoverished and oppressed
peoples of the world. The
question whether a few
researchers should do CBW
research or or counter-insurgency

studies or work on electronic
countermeasures is secondary.
Whether research should be done
here on CBW etc. is not clear to
me nor is it very important. The
academic community must debate
the broader issue to be relevant
and useful to the society. The
flaw in the Stanford community's
response is not simply that it is
studying counter-insurgency and
electronic warfare but that it is
not studying and debating
adequately the relationship of our
nation to the impoverished and
oppressed.
As vital as the Vietnan war
issue is, it is not the society's most
important long-term problem.
Neither our nation nor our
Communist competitors can
adequately deal with our own
internal problems or the problems
of the Third World if we continue
to commit all our surplus
resources to war. Our society is in
the early stages of a most
profound technological
revolution. How can we capture
the fruits of technological
progress at the same time that we
retain individual freedom and the
variety of free enterprise? Can we
resolve conflicts between the
major nations in new ways that
rely more on lav/ and less on
violence? What sorts of new cities
would we build as our society
moves from a deficiency state to a
sufficienty state in capability to
meet physical needs? How do the
minorities gain the initiatives of
freedom and equality in a
competitive society?
These are some of the more
important long-term questions.
The academic environment has
traditionally provided an open
sanctuary where such issues of the

day can be discussed carefully and
with candor.
Should the university become
involved directly in he problems
of our society? This is the
fundamental question facing
Stanford University in deciding
what its relationship to SRI
should be. The basic academic and
teaching function is its most
important job.
The university cannot
undertake alone to solve the
problems of the society.
Exploratory research done solely
at the university on the problems
of the society is not likely to be
properly focused and it is very
unlikely to be implemented. The
exploratory research effort must
be coupled to some r
implementation entity.
SRI can provide the coupling.
It can do the applied work leading
to the implementation much more
effectively than the university
can. Policy and planning studies
and the applied research activity
for implementation are large and
complicated operations compared
to the initial exploratory research.
The long-term function of SRI has
been to serve the operational
aspects of our society where
implementation takes place.
Coordination between the
university activity and the more
applied activity done at SRI is
necessary in financing both
operations. The society badly
needs much more exploratory
work than the government is
presently willing to finance. There
are no other mechanisms available
now in the society for the
financial support of exploratory
work. An effective appeal for
financing is vital. To finance
longer-term projects, SRI needs

the university connection. To
finance its exploratory research,
the university would profit from
association with the
implementation which SRI
provides.
The management problems of
the institute are so different from
those of the university that
common management of the two
entities is impractical.
Furthermore, in both places,
initiatives for exploratory and
implementation research must
come primarily from the staffs,
not from the management.
Several coordinated activities
between the university and the
institute have already been
established. Among them are the
educational policy research
center, the center for radio
astronomy, the decision analysis
program, and work in
telecommunications and
computers.
Effective and meaningful
responses to society's long-term
problems can come from the
Stanford community if:
(1) the staff of the institute
and the faculty and student body
of the university aggressively and
responsibly initiate joint programs
in response to perceived needs,
(2) both administrations seek
highest quality in staffs oriented
toward programs of long-term
importancem and
(3) the trustees of both
institutions protect them from
crippling restrictions imposed in
response to short-term difficulties.

These are some of the more
important long-term questions.
The academic environment has
traditionally provided an open
sanctuary where such issues of the

day can be discussed carefully and
with candor.
Should the university become
involved directly in he problems
of our society? This is the
fundamental question facing
Stanford University in deciding
what its relationship to SRI
should be. The basic academic and
teaching function is its most
important job.
The university cannot
undertake alone to solve the
problems of the society.
Exploratory research done solely
at the university on the problems
of the society is not likely to be
properly focused and it is very
unlikely to be implemented. The
exploratory research effort must
be coupled to some r
implementation entity.
SRI can provide the coupling.
It can do the applied work leading
to the implementation much more
effectively than the university
can. Policy and planning studies
and the applied research activity
for implementation are large and
complicated operations compared
to the initial exploratory research.
The long-term function of SRI has
been to serve the operational
aspects of our society where
implementation takes place.
Coordination between the
university activity and the more
applied activity done at SRI is
necessary in financing both
operations. The society badly
needs much more exploratory
work than the government is
presently willing to finance. There
are no other mechanisms available
now in the society for the
financial support of exploratory
work. An effective appeal for
financing is vital. To finance
longer-term projects, SRI needs

the university connection. To
finance its exploratory research,
the university would profit from
association with the
implementation which SRI
provides.
The management problems of
the institute are so different from
those of the university that
common management of the two
entities is impractical.
Furthermore, in both places,
initiatives for exploratory and
implementation research must
come primarily from the staffs,
not from the management.
Several coordinated activities
between the university and the
institute have already been
established. Among them are the
educational policy research
center, the center for radio
astronomy, the decision analysis
program, and work in
telecommunications and
computers.
Effective and meaningful
responses to society's long-term
problems can come from the
Stanford community if:
(1) the staff of the institute
and the faculty and student body
of the university aggressively and
responsibly initiate joint programs
in response to perceived needs,
(2) both administrations seek
highest quality in staffs oriented
toward programs of long-term
importancem and
(3) the trustees of both
institutions protect them from
crippling restrictions imposed in
response to short-term difficulties.

The Stanford community,
comprising the University and SRI
working symbiotically, potentially
provides a unique resource in our
country to combine the
exploratory research of the
university and the implementive
R&D of the institute. The specific
formal institutional relationship
between Stanford University and
Stanford Research Institute
appears to be secondary in
importance. My concern is that
this period of well-meaning but
overheated discussion may

polarize and thereby separate
these two components of the
Stanford community, who simply
must work together for each to be
effective.
The basic moral issue on
Vietnam war research is to
determine the proper relationship
of the richest and most powerful
nation on the earth to the
impoverished and oppressed
peoples of the world. The
question whether a few
researchers should do CBW
research or or counter-insurgency

studies or work on electronic
countermeasures is secondary.
Whether research should be done
here on CBW etc. is not clear to
me nor is it very important. The
academic community must debate
the broader issue to be relevant
and useful to the society. The
flaw in the Stanford community's
response is not simply that it is
studying counter-insurgency and
electronic warfare but that it is
not studying and debating
adequately the relationship of our
nation to the impoverished and
oppressed.
As vital as the Vietnan war
issue is, it is not the society's most
important long-term problem.
Neither our nation nor our
Communist competitors can
adequately deal with our own
internal problems or the problems
of the Third World if we continue
to commit all our surplus
resources to war. Our society is in
the early stages of a most
profound technological
revolution. How can we capture
the fruits of technological
progress at the same time that we
retain individual freedom and the
variety of free enterprise? Can we
resolve conflicts between the
major nations in new ways that
rely more on lav/ and less on
violence? What sorts of new cities
would we build as our society
moves from a deficiency state to a
sufficienty state in capability to
meet physical needs? How do the
minorities gain the initiatives of
freedom and equality in a
competitive society?
These are some of the more
important long-term questions.

Stanford community if:
(1) the staff of the institute
and the faculty and student body
of the university aggressively and
responsibly initiate joint programs
in response to perceived needs,
(2) both administrations seek
highest quality in staffs oriented
toward programs of long-term
importancem and
(3) the trustees of both
institutions protect them from
crippling restrictions imposed in
response to short-term difficulties.

The Stanford community,
comprising the University and SRI
working symbiotically, potentially
provides a unique resource in our
country to combine the
exploratory research of the
university and the implementive
R&D of the institute. The specific
formal institutional relationship
between Stanford University and
Stanford Research Institute
appears to be secondary in
importance. My concern is that
this period of well-meaning but
overheated discussion may

polarize and thereby separate
these two components of the
Stanford community, who simply
must work together for each to be
effective.
The basic moral issue on
Vietnam war research is to
determine the proper relationship
of the richest and most powerful
nation on the earth to the
impoverished and oppressed
peoples of the world. The
question whether a few
researchers should do CBW
research or or counter-insurgency

studies or work on electronic
countermeasures is secondary.
Whether research should be done
here on CBW etc. is not clear to
me nor is it very important. The
academic community must debate
the broader issue to be relevant
and useful to the society. The
flaw in the Stanford community's
response is not simply that it is
studying counter-insurgency and
electronic warfare but that it is
not studying and debating
adequately the relationship of our
nation to the impoverished and
oppressed.
As vital as the Vietnan war
issue is, it is not the society's most
important long-term problem.
Neither our nation nor our
Communist competitors can
adequately deal with our own
internal problems or the problems
of the Third World if we continue
to commit all our surplus
resources to war. Our society is in
the early stages of a most
profound technological
revolution. How can we capture
the fruits of technological
progress at the same time that we
retain individual freedom and the
variety of free enterprise? Can we
resolve conflicts between the
major nations in new ways that
rely more on lav/ and less on
violence? What sorts of new cities
would we build as our society
moves from a deficiency state to a
sufficienty state in capability to
meet physical needs? How do the
minorities gain the initiatives of
freedom and equality in a
competitive society?
These are some of the more
important long-term questions.
The academic environment has
traditionally provided an open
sanctuary where such issues of the

day can be discussed carefully and
with candor.
Should the university become
involved directly in he problems
of our society? This is the
fundamental question facing
Stanford University in deciding
what its relationship to SRI
should be. The basic academic and
teaching function is its most
important job.
The university cannot
undertake alone to solve the
problems of the society.
Exploratory research done solely
at the university on the problems
of the society is not likely to be
properly focused and it is very
unlikely to be implemented. The
exploratory research effort must
be coupled to some r
implementation entity.
SRI can provide the coupling.
It can do the applied work leading
to the implementation much more
effectively than the university
can. Policy and planning studies
and the applied research activity
for implementation are large and
complicated operations compared
to the initial exploratory research.
The long-term function of SRI has
been to serve the operational
aspects of our society where
implementation takes place.
Coordination between the
university activity and the more
applied activity done at SRI is
necessary in financing both
operations. The society badly
needs much more exploratory
work than the government is
presently willing to finance. There
are no other mechanisms available
now in the society for the
financial support of exploratory
work. An effective appeal for
financing is vital. To finance
longer-term projects, SRI needs

the university connection. To
finance its exploratory research,
the university would profit from
association with the
implementation which SRI
provides.
The management problems of
the institute are so different from
those of the university that
common management of the two
entities is impractical.
Furthermore, in both places,
initiatives for exploratory and
implementation research must
come primarily from the staffs,
not from the management.
Several coordinated activities
between the university and the
institute have already been
established. Among them are the
educational policy research
center, the center for radio
astronomy, the decision analysis
program, and work in
telecommunications and
computers.
Effective and meaningful
responses to society's long-term
problems can come from the
Stanford community if:
(1) the staff of the institute
and the faculty and student body
of the university aggressively and
responsibly initiate joint programs
in response to perceived needs,
(2) both administrations seek
highest quality in staffs oriented
toward programs of long-term
importancem and
(3) the trustees of both
institutions protect them from
crippling restrictions imposed in
response to short-term difficulties.
