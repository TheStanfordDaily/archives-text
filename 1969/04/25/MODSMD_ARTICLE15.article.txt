# Man And State
## Sit-In Provides Political Context 
### Bill Evers 
The recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory provides a
context in which the current state
of politics at Stanford may be
considered.
ASSU president Denis Hayes
saw the sit-in as a way to speed
matters through their proper
channels. He had hoped that those
sitting-in would declare on
Wednesday night, April 9, that
they would leave at Friday noon,
April 11. If this had happened,
the sit-in could have been a
weapon in Hayes's arsenal, to be
used while negotiating with the
administration, faculty
representatives, and the trustees.
If the sit-in were recognized by
everyone as an act of student
concern which would be over by
Friday, April 11, it would mean

that student government
politicians and members of the
University Advisory Committee
(Denis Hayes, Michael Sweeney, &
Patrick Shea) would be consulted
on any top-level decisions and
would wield influence with regard
to the content of those decisions.
These important students would
be the touchstones of legitimacy.
Trustees, administrators, and
faculty leaders would use these
students to provide student
authorization of whatever
comprise could be worked out.
The energy which went into
the sit-in bubbled up from below,
rather than filtering down from
the top. The student politicians
hoped that the sit-in would be no
act of lese majesty. The best thing
these students thought that could

be done with the energy of the
sit-in was to use it in institutional
channels.
Lent Names
For the student politicians the
sit-in had no inherent virtue in its
very existence as a
counter-community. They lent
their names to the April 3
Movement; and they hoped that
in the ensuing crisis trustees,
administrators, and faculty leaders
would defer to them as student
constituency representatives.
It is in this light that one can
best understand Denis Hayes's
speeches urging that the sit-in
come to a close, his April 17 letter
of resignation from the April 3
Movement (a letter which was
hastily withdrawn and remains

unpublished), and his call for the
student body to meet together the
afternoon of Friday, April 18.
That convocation might well have
created a situation in which
community support would have
withdrawn from the sit-in.
Calling a general meeting of the
student body was a move
reminiscent of Charles DeGaulle's
ploy of calling a general election
as a way of ending France's May
1968 rebellion. With the
groundwork already laid for
DeGaulle by France's trade union
leadership, all the French
students' potential allies were
integrated back into the system
through the election.
Federal Fear
ASSU president Hayes and
university president Kenneth
Pitzer were worried throughout
the sit-in about the possibility of
intervention by federal
authorities. To avoid this
intervention, the Stanford Judicial
Council recommended that Pitzer
assume emergency powers, powers
which Pitzer described to the
faculty as amounting to "internal
martial law."
If the federal authorities had
intervened, it would not mean
that the university was unable to
govern itself. Indeed the existence
of a threat of outside intervention
meant that the university does not
truly govern its own destiny. The
existing structure's delegated
authority lasts as long as it acts in
line with the system's national
goals. When the university
president fails, outside forces
move in, as the Soviets did in
Czechoslovakia.
President Pitzer was disturbed
that students refused to give their
names to certain specially
deputized faculty members. These
faculty members were not
standing up for university
self-determination. The question
is not whether the faculty
members had good intentions; the
question is what did they do with
their power. The fact is that they

were acting simply in lieu ot
outside forces.
Threat to Feds
The federal authorities saw the
sit-in as a threat to the security of
their secret files. It was not that
the sit-in threatened the people
who make up human society. But
rather the sit-in threatened the
authority of the tederal
government and, in this case, the
authority of their designated
surrogates—the university's
administration and its
federally-employed researchers.
To understand the nature ol the
case, remember that Lenin had
struck a blow against the Great
Powers of the world by publishing
the secret treaties relating to
World War I.
The faculty members who
came around asking names were
then acting as the internal
administrators of a system that
many of those sitting-in regarded
as illegitimate. So the students did
not give their names.
Even the CBS television
network polices itself internally
(Joan Baez & Smothers Bros.)
believing it can do so more
efficiently than the higher
authorities (the FCC or crusading
senator John Pastore of Rhode
Island). It is part of the theory
and practice of benevolent
despotism.
Channeling and social control
functions are an integral part of
universities like Stanlord. Fortune
magazine devoted much of its
January issue to the public service
functions of modern universities,
as the proving grounds of
federally-sponsored research and
the training grounds for the
executive suites of big business.
American universities are part of
the American system, and the
system takes care of its own, if
necessary with federal marshals or
the U.S. Army.

not give their names.

and practice of benevolent

The recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory provides a
context in which the current state
of politics at Stanford may be
considered.
ASSU president Denis Hayes
saw the sit-in as a way to speed
matters through their proper
channels. He had hoped that those
sitting-in would declare on
Wednesday night, April 9, that
they would leave at Friday noon,
April 11. If this had happened,
the sit-in could have been a
weapon in Hayes's arsenal, to be
used while negotiating with the
administration, faculty
representatives, and the trustees.
If the sit-in were recognized by
everyone as an act of student
concern which would be over by
Friday, April 11, it would mean

that student government
politicians and members of the
University Advisory Committee
(Denis Hayes, Michael Sweeney, &
Patrick Shea) would be consulted
on any top-level decisions and
would wield influence with regard
to the content of those decisions.
These important students would
be the touchstones of legitimacy.
Trustees, administrators, and
faculty leaders would use these
students to provide student
authorization of whatever
comprise could be worked out.
The energy which went into
the sit-in bubbled up from below,
rather than filtering down from
the top. The student politicians
hoped that the sit-in would be no
act of lese majesty. The best thing
these students thought that could

be done with the energy of the
sit-in was to use it in institutional
channels.
Lent Names
For the student politicians the
sit-in had no inherent virtue in its
very existence as a
counter-community. They lent
their names to the April 3
Movement; and they hoped that
in the ensuing crisis trustees,
administrators, and faculty leaders
would defer to them as student
constituency representatives.
It is in this light that one can
best understand Denis Hayes's
speeches urging that the sit-in
come to a close, his April 17 letter
of resignation from the April 3
Movement (a letter which was
hastily withdrawn and remains

unpublished), and his call for the
student body to meet together the
afternoon of Friday, April 18.
That convocation might well have
created a situation in which
community support would have
withdrawn from the sit-in.
Calling a general meeting of the
student body was a move
reminiscent of Charles DeGaulle's
ploy of calling a general election
as a way of ending France's May
1968 rebellion. With the
groundwork already laid for
DeGaulle by France's trade union
leadership, all the French
students' potential allies were
integrated back into the system
through the election.
Federal Fear
ASSU president Hayes and
university president Kenneth
Pitzer were worried throughout
the sit-in about the possibility of
intervention by federal
authorities. To avoid this
intervention, the Stanford Judicial
Council recommended that Pitzer
assume emergency powers, powers
which Pitzer described to the
faculty as amounting to "internal
martial law."
If the federal authorities had
intervened, it would not mean
that the university was unable to
govern itself. Indeed the existence
of a threat of outside intervention
meant that the university does not
truly govern its own destiny. The
existing structure's delegated
authority lasts as long as it acts in
line with the system's national
goals. When the university
president fails, outside forces
move in, as the Soviets did in
Czechoslovakia.
President Pitzer was disturbed
that students refused to give their
names to certain specially
deputized faculty members. These
faculty members were not
standing up for university
self-determination. The question
is not whether the faculty
members had good intentions; the
question is what did they do with
their power. The fact is that they

were acting simply in lieu ot
outside forces.
Threat to Feds
The federal authorities saw the
sit-in as a threat to the security of
their secret files. It was not that
the sit-in threatened the people
who make up human society. But
rather the sit-in threatened the
authority of the tederal
government and, in this case, the
authority of their designated
surrogates—the university's
administration and its
federally-employed researchers.
To understand the nature ol the
case, remember that Lenin had
struck a blow against the Great
Powers of the world by publishing
the secret treaties relating to
World War I.
The faculty members who
came around asking names were
then acting as the internal
administrators of a system that
many of those sitting-in regarded
as illegitimate. So the students did
not give their names.

their power. The fact is that they

were acting simply in lieu ot
outside forces.
Threat to Feds
The federal authorities saw the
sit-in as a threat to the security of
their secret files. It was not that
the sit-in threatened the people
who make up human society. But
rather the sit-in threatened the
authority of the tederal
government and, in this case, the
authority of their designated
surrogates—the university's
administration and its
federally-employed researchers.
To understand the nature ol the
case, remember that Lenin had
struck a blow against the Great
Powers of the world by publishing
the secret treaties relating to
World War I.
The faculty members who
came around asking names were
then acting as the internal
administrators of a system that
many of those sitting-in regarded
as illegitimate. So the students did
not give their names.
Even the CBS television
network polices itself internally
(Joan Baez & Smothers Bros.)
believing it can do so more
efficiently than the higher
authorities (the FCC or crusading
senator John Pastore of Rhode
Island). It is part of the theory
and practice of benevolent
despotism.
Channeling and social control
functions are an integral part of
universities like Stanlord. Fortune
magazine devoted much of its
January issue to the public service
functions of modern universities,
as the proving grounds of
federally-sponsored research and
the training grounds for the
executive suites of big business.
American universities are part of
the American system, and the
system takes care of its own, if
necessary with federal marshals or
the U.S. Army.

science and a member of THE
DAILY editorial committee-Ed.)
The recent sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory provides a
context in which the current state
of politics at Stanford may be
considered.
ASSU president Denis Hayes
saw the sit-in as a way to speed
matters through their proper
channels. He had hoped that those
sitting-in would declare on
Wednesday night, April 9, that
they would leave at Friday noon,
April 11. If this had happened,
the sit-in could have been a
weapon in Hayes's arsenal, to be
used while negotiating with the
administration, faculty
representatives, and the trustees.
If the sit-in were recognized by
everyone as an act of student
concern which would be over by
Friday, April 11, it would mean

that student government
politicians and members of the
University Advisory Committee
(Denis Hayes, Michael Sweeney, &
Patrick Shea) would be consulted
on any top-level decisions and
would wield influence with regard
to the content of those decisions.
These important students would
be the touchstones of legitimacy.
Trustees, administrators, and
faculty leaders would use these
students to provide student
authorization of whatever
comprise could be worked out.
The energy which went into
the sit-in bubbled up from below,
rather than filtering down from
the top. The student politicians
hoped that the sit-in would be no
act of lese majesty. The best thing
these students thought that could

be done with the energy of the
sit-in was to use it in institutional
channels.
Lent Names
For the student politicians the
sit-in had no inherent virtue in its
very existence as a
counter-community. They lent
their names to the April 3
Movement; and they hoped that
in the ensuing crisis trustees,
administrators, and faculty leaders
would defer to them as student
constituency representatives.
It is in this light that one can
best understand Denis Hayes's
speeches urging that the sit-in
come to a close, his April 17 letter
of resignation from the April 3
Movement (a letter which was
hastily withdrawn and remains

unpublished), and his call for the
student body to meet together the
afternoon of Friday, April 18.
That convocation might well have
created a situation in which
community support would have
withdrawn from the sit-in.
Calling a general meeting of the
student body was a move
reminiscent of Charles DeGaulle's
ploy of calling a general election
as a way of ending France's May
1968 rebellion. With the
groundwork already laid for
DeGaulle by France's trade union
leadership, all the French
students' potential allies were
integrated back into the system
through the election.
Federal Fear
ASSU president Hayes and
university president Kenneth
Pitzer were worried throughout
the sit-in about the possibility of
intervention by federal
authorities. To avoid this
intervention, the Stanford Judicial
Council recommended that Pitzer
assume emergency powers, powers
which Pitzer described to the
faculty as amounting to "internal
martial law."
If the federal authorities had
intervened, it would not mean
that the university was unable to
govern itself. Indeed the existence
of a threat of outside intervention
meant that the university does not
truly govern its own destiny. The
existing structure's delegated
authority lasts as long as it acts in
line with the system's national
goals. When the university
president fails, outside forces
move in, as the Soviets did in
Czechoslovakia.
President Pitzer was disturbed
that students refused to give their
names to certain specially
deputized faculty members. These
faculty members were not
standing up for university
self-determination. The question
is not whether the faculty
members had good intentions; the
question is what did they do with
their power. The fact is that they

were acting simply in lieu ot
outside forces.
