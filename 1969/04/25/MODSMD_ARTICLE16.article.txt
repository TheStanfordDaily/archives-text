# From The Ivory Tower
## Moral Rightness Test 
### David Grey 
This Moral Rightness of Sit-ins Test (MRST) is
not meant to be taken by anyone uninterested in a
"true dialogue," and the rights of others nor by
anyone non-constructive in problem-solving
efforts. By definition, such a non-Thinker would
automatically score himself 100 per cent.
Instead, this is for the overpowering majority of
us who would like to think we are rightly
concerned about the recent weeks at Stanford and
the recent years of the world and who would like
to think we are truly constructive in our concern.
In addition, this test could be for the some who
should be concerned but, so unfortunately, aren't.
MRST is a candid and pointed pleading for
self-examination of conscience. Though blatantly
biased in wording, the test is designed to be
perhaps a handy check-list for deciding some
personal actions and commitments for example,
most obviously: to sit-in or not to sit-in next time.
The procedures here are simple. We all start
with 100 points. The object is then to see how far
down the Moral Rightness scale we should place
ourselves. The toughest part is trying to answer
honestly those questions which "really know how
to hurt a guy" or that hit a too sensitive nerve.
Otherwise, we can relax —because we know we'll
really score well. Keep a running score of your
minus points; at the end, simply add these up and
subtract from 100. That's your score—your degree
of Rightness or, if you prefer, your degree of
Righteousness:
Question category 1. Have I tried to inform
myself as fully as possible on as many as possible
of the practical, moral and philosophical issues of
recent months and weeks? (For example: the
reasons, right and wrong or valid and invalid, for
Viet Nam and for the horrors of any world tension
or war. Or: the SRI Committee report and
others—and what they fully reflect.) Have I tried
fully to learn from others—to listen to the
messages of the words and not primarily the drama
of the medium? (Subtract 0-5 points here.)
Question category 2. How's my U.S. history
and understanding of what democracy has been
and can be? Especially: how informed am I about
the legal, moral and philosophical principles of
freedom of speech, privacy or other Constitutional
guarantees? Do I know enough about totalitarian
approaches to world problems and totalitarian
tactics? (Subtract up to 5 points here.)
Question category 3. How honest have I been
with myself about the sources of my
convictions—say,, about why I might be taking an
extremist position? How many of my recent
judgments might stem, in part, from
rationalizations, personal frustrations and
hostilities or from only the fun and games of it all?
How much have I been leaning on crowd support
and power rather than taking on sometimes the
most moral position of standing alone? (This is a
bonus question; no penalty. It is, indeed,
impossible for anyone to really know the motives
of others or even himself. Thus, as an unfair

question, you do not "have" to consider
subtracting points. If guilt feelings arise, of course,
points can be subtracted voluntarily.)
Question No. 4. Am I truly willing to pay the
price(s) for any of my extreme views, including
the penalties my society or community may have
to reluctantly impose. Or do I expect to have my
cake and amnesty, too? (Sorry, but this is an
up-to-10-pointer. If you are not a fully enrolled
students nor a "true member" of this community
and want to sit-in, you "must" subtract at least 2
points.)
Question category 5. How am I on the facts?
(For example, what exactly have the University
and individuals within it been trying to do to
improve their contributions in recent years? What
have I tried constructively to do? Have I exhausted
all means where contributions could have been or
could be made?) Do I take into account the
long-term effects of many short-term
confrontations? (Eg: the diverting of energies from
other high-priority programs within the
University. Up to 10 points off here.)
Question No. 6. What do I know about the full
meaning of the concept "academic freedom" and
about the rights of, say, all individuals on
non-University time to do as they please (within a
few societal limitations)? (Worth at least 20
points.)
Question category 7. How's my empathy for
others—as human beings with very human
strengths and weaknesses very different ways of
seeing the world coerced from doing work which I
felt obliged to do, believed in doing or merely
wanted to do? How would I feel if my desk had
been pawed through and personal papers
borrowed, moved or lost? If my doctoral research
had been disrupted and my graduation delayed.
(Or phrased another way: am I sure "violence"
includes only such physical acts as killing or
beating? Or might it be defined rightly by some as
including the losf? of freedom or even, in part, only
psychological constraint? (50 points.)
That last item is the big one— at least as
programmed here. At any rate, again, now simply
add up your minus points and subtract from 100.
Each person must judge for himself what is an
"acceptable minimum" to justify a extreme
position. In other words, make up your own
descriptive judgments for each range of scores.
But, of course, remember, that by definition each
minus point on these questions (or others)
subtracts from what you are claiming to be the
absolute strength of your position.
Final thought: For those repacking their
sleeping bags because they might have scored a 91,
please remember the guy next to you who feels as
concerned as you do (but who refuses to disrupt
others) scored a 92. And, of course, the test
proctor thinks his own score is 93 or 94.

How much have I been leaning on crowd support
and power rather than taking on sometimes the
most moral position of standing alone? (This is a
bonus question; no penalty. It is, indeed,
impossible for anyone to really know the motives
of others or even himself. Thus, as an unfair

question, you do not "have" to consider
subtracting points. If guilt feelings arise, of course,
points can be subtracted voluntarily.)
Question No. 4. Am I truly willing to pay the
price(s) for any of my extreme views, including
the penalties my society or community may have
to reluctantly impose. Or do I expect to have my
cake and amnesty, too? (Sorry, but this is an
up-to-10-pointer. If you are not a fully enrolled
students nor a "true member" of this community
and want to sit-in, you "must" subtract at least 2
points.)
Question category 5. How am I on the facts?
(For example, what exactly have the University
and individuals within it been trying to do to
improve their contributions in recent years? What
have I tried constructively to do? Have I exhausted
all means where contributions could have been or
could be made?) Do I take into account the
long-term effects of many short-term
confrontations? (Eg: the diverting of energies from
other high-priority programs within the
University. Up to 10 points off here.)
Question No. 6. What do I know about the full
meaning of the concept "academic freedom" and
about the rights of, say, all individuals on
non-University time to do as they please (within a
few societal limitations)? (Worth at least 20
points.)
Question category 7. How's my empathy for
others—as human beings with very human
strengths and weaknesses very different ways of
seeing the world coerced from doing work which I
felt obliged to do, believed in doing or merely
wanted to do? How would I feel if my desk had
been pawed through and personal papers
borrowed, moved or lost? If my doctoral research
had been disrupted and my graduation delayed.
(Or phrased another way: am I sure "violence"
includes only such physical acts as killing or
beating? Or might it be defined rightly by some as
including the losf? of freedom or even, in part, only
psychological constraint? (50 points.)
That last item is the big one— at least as
programmed here. At any rate, again, now simply
add up your minus points and subtract from 100.
Each person must judge for himself what is an
"acceptable minimum" to justify a extreme
position. In other words, make up your own
descriptive judgments for each range of scores.
But, of course, remember, that by definition each
minus point on these questions (or others)
subtracts from what you are claiming to be the
absolute strength of your position.
Final thought: For those repacking their
sleeping bags because they might have scored a 91,
please remember the guy next to you who feels as
concerned as you do (but who refuses to disrupt
others) scored a 92. And, of course, the test
proctor thinks his own score is 93 or 94.
(David L. Grey is an assistant Professor of
Communication —Ed.)
This Moral Rightness of Sit-ins Test (MRST) is
not meant to be taken by anyone uninterested in a
"true dialogue," and the rights of others nor by
anyone non-constructive in problem-solving
efforts. By definition, such a non-Thinker would
automatically score himself 100 per cent.
Instead, this is for the overpowering majority of
us who would like to think we are rightly
concerned about the recent weeks at Stanford and
the recent years of the world and who would like
to think we are truly constructive in our concern.
In addition, this test could be for the some who
should be concerned but, so unfortunately, aren't.
MRST is a candid and pointed pleading for
self-examination of conscience. Though blatantly
biased in wording, the test is designed to be
perhaps a handy check-list for deciding some
personal actions and commitments for example,
most obviously: to sit-in or not to sit-in next time.
The procedures here are simple. We all start
with 100 points. The object is then to see how far
down the Moral Rightness scale we should place
ourselves. The toughest part is trying to answer
honestly those questions which "really know how
to hurt a guy" or that hit a too sensitive nerve.
Otherwise, we can relax —because we know we'll
really score well. Keep a running score of your
minus points; at the end, simply add these up and
subtract from 100. That's your score—your degree
of Rightness or, if you prefer, your degree of
Righteousness:
Question category 1. Have I tried to inform
myself as fully as possible on as many as possible
of the practical, moral and philosophical issues of
recent months and weeks? (For example: the
reasons, right and wrong or valid and invalid, for
Viet Nam and for the horrors of any world tension
or war. Or: the SRI Committee report and
others—and what they fully reflect.) Have I tried
fully to learn from others—to listen to the
messages of the words and not primarily the drama
of the medium? (Subtract 0-5 points here.)
Question category 2. How's my U.S. history
and understanding of what democracy has been
and can be? Especially: how informed am I about
the legal, moral and philosophical principles of
freedom of speech, privacy or other Constitutional
guarantees? Do I know enough about totalitarian
approaches to world problems and totalitarian
tactics? (Subtract up to 5 points here.)
Question category 3. How honest have I been
with myself about the sources of my
convictions—say,, about why I might be taking an
extremist position? How many of my recent
judgments might stem, in part, from
rationalizations, personal frustrations and
hostilities or from only the fun and games of it all?
How much have I been leaning on crowd support
and power rather than taking on sometimes the

subtracts from what you are claiming to be the
absolute strength of your position.
Final thought: For those repacking their
sleeping bags because they might have scored a 91,
please remember the guy next to you who feels as
concerned as you do (but who refuses to disrupt
others) scored a 92. And, of course, the test
proctor thinks his own score is 93 or 94.

This Moral Rightness of Sit-ins Test (MRST) is
not meant to be taken by anyone uninterested in a
"true dialogue," and the rights of others nor by
anyone non-constructive in problem-solving
efforts. By definition, such a non-Thinker would
automatically score himself 100 per cent.
Instead, this is for the overpowering majority of
us who would like to think we are rightly
concerned about the recent weeks at Stanford and
the recent years of the world and who would like
to think we are truly constructive in our concern.
In addition, this test could be for the some who
should be concerned but, so unfortunately, aren't.
MRST is a candid and pointed pleading for
self-examination of conscience. Though blatantly
biased in wording, the test is designed to be
perhaps a handy check-list for deciding some
personal actions and commitments for example,
most obviously: to sit-in or not to sit-in next time.
The procedures here are simple. We all start
with 100 points. The object is then to see how far
down the Moral Rightness scale we should place
ourselves. The toughest part is trying to answer
honestly those questions which "really know how
to hurt a guy" or that hit a too sensitive nerve.
Otherwise, we can relax —because we know we'll
really score well. Keep a running score of your
minus points; at the end, simply add these up and
subtract from 100. That's your score—your degree
of Rightness or, if you prefer, your degree of
Righteousness:
Question category 1. Have I tried to inform
myself as fully as possible on as many as possible
of the practical, moral and philosophical issues of
recent months and weeks? (For example: the
reasons, right and wrong or valid and invalid, for
Viet Nam and for the horrors of any world tension
or war. Or: the SRI Committee report and
others—and what they fully reflect.) Have I tried
fully to learn from others—to listen to the
messages of the words and not primarily the drama
of the medium? (Subtract 0-5 points here.)
Question category 2. How's my U.S. history
and understanding of what democracy has been
and can be? Especially: how informed am I about
the legal, moral and philosophical principles of
freedom of speech, privacy or other Constitutional
guarantees? Do I know enough about totalitarian
approaches to world problems and totalitarian
tactics? (Subtract up to 5 points here.)
Question category 3. How honest have I been
with myself about the sources of my
convictions—say,, about why I might be taking an
extremist position? How many of my recent
judgments might stem, in part, from
rationalizations, personal frustrations and
hostilities or from only the fun and games of it all?
How much have I been leaning on crowd support
and power rather than taking on sometimes the
most moral position of standing alone? (This is a
bonus question; no penalty. It is, indeed,
impossible for anyone to really know the motives
of others or even himself. Thus, as an unfair

question, you do not "have" to consider
subtracting points. If guilt feelings arise, of course,
points can be subtracted voluntarily.)
Question No. 4. Am I truly willing to pay the
price(s) for any of my extreme views, including
the penalties my society or community may have
to reluctantly impose. Or do I expect to have my
cake and amnesty, too? (Sorry, but this is an
up-to-10-pointer. If you are not a fully enrolled
students nor a "true member" of this community
and want to sit-in, you "must" subtract at least 2
points.)
Question category 5. How am I on the facts?
(For example, what exactly have the University
and individuals within it been trying to do to
improve their contributions in recent years? What
have I tried constructively to do? Have I exhausted
all means where contributions could have been or
could be made?) Do I take into account the
long-term effects of many short-term
confrontations? (Eg: the diverting of energies from
other high-priority programs within the
University. Up to 10 points off here.)
Question No. 6. What do I know about the full
meaning of the concept "academic freedom" and
about the rights of, say, all individuals on
non-University time to do as they please (within a
few societal limitations)? (Worth at least 20
points.)
Question category 7. How's my empathy for
others—as human beings with very human
strengths and weaknesses very different ways of
seeing the world coerced from doing work which I
felt obliged to do, believed in doing or merely
wanted to do? How would I feel if my desk had
been pawed through and personal papers
borrowed, moved or lost? If my doctoral research
had been disrupted and my graduation delayed.
(Or phrased another way: am I sure "violence"
includes only such physical acts as killing or
beating? Or might it be defined rightly by some as
including the losf? of freedom or even, in part, only
psychological constraint? (50 points.)
That last item is the big one— at least as
programmed here. At any rate, again, now simply
add up your minus points and subtract from 100.
Each person must judge for himself what is an
"acceptable minimum" to justify a extreme
position. In other words, make up your own
descriptive judgments for each range of scores.
But, of course, remember, that by definition each
minus point on these questions (or others)
subtracts from what you are claiming to be the
absolute strength of your position.
Final thought: For those repacking their
sleeping bags because they might have scored a 91,
please remember the guy next to you who feels as
concerned as you do (but who refuses to disrupt
others) scored a 92. And, of course, the test
