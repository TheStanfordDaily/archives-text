## Academic Freedom Confusion 
### Richard Meserve 
In the discussion of classified
research on campus it now
appears that many of the faculty
will take a stand against classified
research on the basis of academic
freedom. They argue the
university community must
balance the freedom of the
researcher to investigate any
phenomenon he desires against
the freedom of the community to
have access to his information in
order to repeat his experiments
and question his methods and
conclusions.
The faculty, prompted by
recent events, is likely to demand
of all campus research the
capacity to disclose all equipment,
data, conclusions. An exception
would be made for peripheral
information the disclosure of
which would needlessly invade the
privacy of subject individuals, as
in psychology experiments.
They will thereby outlaw
classified research on campus, but
their action will be sanctified by
the incantation of academic
freedom.
The issue which prompted the
sit-in, and which found expression
in the March convocation of the
scientific community, was
distinctly not related to this
aspect of academic freedom
however. It was an outgrowth of
the feeling that some research is
immoral. The April Third
Movement cites the specific
demands that CBW research,
counter-insurgency research, and
classified research be condemned
and eliminated from campus

because of an appraisal that the
results of this research will be
used for destructive purposes, not
from any feeling that the
prerogatives of free interchange of
information have been
jeopardized. Indeed, the
community knows more about
the details of classified research at
AEL than it knows about research
anywhere else on campus.
If the result of the faculty
action on research satisfies the
April Third Movement, I feel
nevertheless that the real issues on
campus research will have been
submerged rather than resolved.
First, I think the April Third
Movement's demands involve a
rather heavy handed excision of
research. Not all classified
research is used for inhumane
purposes; for example, the
development of detectors of
nuclear explosions are necessary
to stop underground weapons
testing, yet the characteristics of
the detectors must be secret in
order that they not be
circumvented.
Secondly, I am discouraged
that the faculty is fooling itself.
The relationship of academic
freedom and secret research was
not considered during World War
II and it is no more appropriate to
consider it now. The community
concern is due to a contemporary
moral reaction to military
research rather than a concern
with the alteration of "the line"
of academic freedom. To create
artifically academic freedom as
the issue is to dodge the serious

and difficult moral questions
which should be faced.
The faculty seems reluctant to
confront the implications of
research, perhaps because of their
fear of legislating morality. The
suppression of truth because it
challenges contemporary moral
authorities is a very real problem
in this century in which
Darwinism could not be taught in
many of our schools until
recently. The events of this Spring
make it clear that they should
face the real issues however.
Perhaps one solution is to
condemn the restriction of ideas,
while attempting to restrict the
development of devices whose
most probable immediate use is
not beneficial to mankind. This
may be a restriction of individual
freedom, but it is a necessary one.
If someone marches into my
home and holds a gun against my
head, you as a community have
the responsibility to disarm him,
even though it is an infringement
of that individual's right to act.
Analogously, if someone in the
biology department is creating a
virulent strain of plague, we as a
community have the
responsibility to halt the research,
because the most probable use is
inhumane. Obviously the moral
delineation of research at
Stanford is not so sharp, but it is
the sphere of moral responsibility
in research to which we should
direct our attentions.
