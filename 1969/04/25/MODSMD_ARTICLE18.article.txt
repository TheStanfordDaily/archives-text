## CBW Alternative 
### Gary L. Alderman 
I am continually amazed at the seeming love for high explosives and
lead projectiles that the current opponents of Chemical and Biological
Warfare constantly display. What most of these bleeding hearts fail to
realize is that CBW techniques offer for the first time in history the
opportunity for the use of non-lethal, non-injurious weaponry.
Take, for example, the use of tear gas to drive the Viet Cong from
their burrows so Marines could simply grab and disarm the coughing
and bewildered VC and escort them to POW camps. This practice was
too barbarous for a great many of the do-gooders, and the hue and cry
which was raised pressured our forces into the more "Humane"
technique of simply dropping bundles of dynamite down the tunnels.
I'm sure Charlie is really blowing kisses at the anti-CBW lobby for that
decision.
In addition to this type of application, a promising area of CBW
research is concerned with psychochemicals, notably drugs of the LSD
and Mescaline families. Now envision a wartime situation of two
opposing armed forces, where we must eliminate the opponent. Several
alternatives present themselves:
METHOD 1: Clobber the hell out of the enemy with bombs,
artillery, and rockets and then advance into the disputed territory over
the shattered corpses of your late opponents, avoiding the smoking
ruins of the homes of innocent civilians (possibly friendly).
METHOD 2: Release an LSD-type drug over the area so the enemy
takes a short "trip" and happily accepts the pretty flowers our troops
offer in exchange for those ugly guns. When reality returns, the former
enemy is comfortably ensconced in a POW camp, the civilians still have
their homes and deaths have been avoided.
METHOD 2A: Use agents which produce sleep, disorientation, or a
drop in blood pressure (which would leave the subject perfectly
comfortable—flat on his back—but causes fainting if a fair amount of
activity is attempted, like getting up and shooting somebody.)
And now, the "ultimate horror," the "B" in CBW, appears in
METHOD 3: How about a virulent strain of intestinal flu which lasts a
day or so, causing nausea, diarrhea, etc.? This would really catch them
with their pants down, and no one would be in any shape to fight. This
is admittedly uncomfortable, but NOT inhumane. (When polled, over 3
out of 4 enemy soldiers preferred a case of the 24-hr. flu to
contemplating the gaping hole where their guts used to be.)
It seems to me that the opponents of CBW have failed to do their
homework since their insistence of METHOD 1 as "The Only
Acceptable and Humane Way" is logically indefensible. I am not trying
to argue the question of the morality of war, but only the fact that
CBW offers a chance for eliminating many of its horrors, NOT adding
to them. The demonstrations against CBW have been woefully
misguided. Such energy should have been put to better use elsewhere,
easing human suffering as they say they are concerned with, rather than
repeating the same old story heard ever since the ancient Greeks used a
choking fog against the Persians instead of skewering them on pikes.

to argue the question of the morality of war, but only the fact that
CBW offers a chance for eliminating many of its horrors, NOT adding
to them. The demonstrations against CBW have been woefully
misguided. Such energy should have been put to better use elsewhere,
easing human suffering as they say they are concerned with, rather than
repeating the same old story heard ever since the ancient Greeks used a
choking fog against the Persians instead of skewering them on pikes.

I am continually amazed at the seeming love for high explosives and
lead projectiles that the current opponents of Chemical and Biological
Warfare constantly display. What most of these bleeding hearts fail to
realize is that CBW techniques offer for the first time in history the
opportunity for the use of non-lethal, non-injurious weaponry.
Take, for example, the use of tear gas to drive the Viet Cong from
their burrows so Marines could simply grab and disarm the coughing
and bewildered VC and escort them to POW camps. This practice was
too barbarous for a great many of the do-gooders, and the hue and cry
which was raised pressured our forces into the more "Humane"
technique of simply dropping bundles of dynamite down the tunnels.
I'm sure Charlie is really blowing kisses at the anti-CBW lobby for that
decision.
In addition to this type of application, a promising area of CBW
research is concerned with psychochemicals, notably drugs of the LSD
and Mescaline families. Now envision a wartime situation of two
opposing armed forces, where we must eliminate the opponent. Several
alternatives present themselves:
METHOD 1: Clobber the hell out of the enemy with bombs,
artillery, and rockets and then advance into the disputed territory over
the shattered corpses of your late opponents, avoiding the smoking
ruins of the homes of innocent civilians (possibly friendly).
METHOD 2: Release an LSD-type drug over the area so the enemy
takes a short "trip" and happily accepts the pretty flowers our troops
offer in exchange for those ugly guns. When reality returns, the former
enemy is comfortably ensconced in a POW camp, the civilians still have
their homes and deaths have been avoided.
METHOD 2A: Use agents which produce sleep, disorientation, or a
drop in blood pressure (which would leave the subject perfectly
comfortable—flat on his back—but causes fainting if a fair amount of
activity is attempted, like getting up and shooting somebody.)
And now, the "ultimate horror," the "B" in CBW, appears in
METHOD 3: How about a virulent strain of intestinal flu which lasts a
day or so, causing nausea, diarrhea, etc.? This would really catch them
with their pants down, and no one would be in any shape to fight. This
is admittedly uncomfortable, but NOT inhumane. (When polled, over 3
out of 4 enemy soldiers preferred a case of the 24-hr. flu to
contemplating the gaping hole where their guts used to be.)
It seems to me that the opponents of CBW have failed to do their
homework since their insistence of METHOD 1 as "The Only
Acceptable and Humane Way" is logically indefensible. I am not trying
to argue the question of the morality of war, but only the fact that
CBW offers a chance for eliminating many of its horrors, NOT adding
to them. The demonstrations against CBW have been woefully
