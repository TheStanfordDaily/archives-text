# Guest Column
## The University As A Democracy
### Paul Bernstein 
(The following is an edited text of
extemporaneous remarks made by Haul
Hernstein, a graduate student in
political science, at the student body
meeting in Frost Ampitheater last
Friday.)
It's very difficult to say
anything after that because the
person speaking before me made
the point of his argument so well
that we should not keep talking
about anything, but we should
look inward to ourselves. But it is
not enough merely to look
inward. The whole purpose of this
movement has been not only to
get us to look inward, to realize
what our moral concerns are, but
to call upon us not to sit with
those moral concerns, but to take
actions so that we can still respect
ourselves as human beings.
Many people have spoken
today expressing their concern.
And I have strained my ears; and I
think many other people have
listened very carefully, trying to
find out what the conclusion of
that concern would be. What
would be the actions that these
individual human beings would
take, having expressed their
indignation at, or their difficulty

of agreeing with, the kinds of
research that are going on, or
especially with the applications of
that research? What are they going
to do about that? How could they
ask us to respect them as
experts—or as individual human
beings—if they are only going to
talk about the disagreeableness of
a situation, the badness of a
situation, or even, yes, the
difficulty of a situation without
talking about taking honest steps
to solve the situation.
Slate 01" Mind
Now, it is this state of mind
that has been concerning a
number of people on campus, not
only students. And these people
are represented in the April Third
Coalition—which has now become
the April Third Movement. Now
the question is very, very relevant
to every person on this campus of
what precisely does one do after
coming to a decision on one's
moral concerns. It's not as though
this question has been ignored
here, but I don't think we've
come yet to the core. Professors
have spoken of their faith in the
democratic process. We, too,

would like to have faith in the
democratic process, but we also
have eyes, and we have to judge
from our own experience whether
or not the democratic process is
operable, and under what
conditions it is operable.
This University would choose
to operate as a democracy. It
therefore has persons who are
acknowledged by the rest of the
community, within this
University, of taking upon
themselves [objections from the
crowd 1 (I'm sorry, but that's the
way it happened; perhaps there
should have been a referendum
first as to which people should
have the authority.)
Moral Responsibility
The way it is set now, these
people (trustees, administrators,
and faculty) declare upon
themselves the moral
responsibility for the governance
of this University. We are
supposed to assume that they
have not only the expertise, but
also the sensitivity to the needs of
this University in order to deserve
that responsibility.
That is the only jusitfication

by which we can allow them to
make decisions on our own lives.
Surely the deliberate, quiet,
reasoned processes should lead to
decisions which are for the benefit
of society. But the problem
here—and it's been demonstrated
very well today by speakers
throughout the whole spectrum,
as I hope to present to you right
now—is one of not living up to
those responsibilities.
The Majority Report [of the
Stanford—Sßl Study] is the
report of a committee set up
through the democratic processes,
or at least set up in faith of the
democratic principles of this
University, believing that a
question as serious as the kinds of
research for which we are
responsible could be examined in
a reasoned manner.
Faults in Assumptions
Yet the way that those
questions were examined shows
very much the faults in our
assumptions about whether or not
we are working as a democracy
here. Professor Solomon from the
Business School spoke about the
kinds of research we ourselves in
the Coalition had raised here.
How did he talk about that
research? He said something about
Viet Nam war research, chemical
and biological research, telling us
it should be judged warfare
research—by the fact that it's one
per cent of what SRI does. That
was the measure he used to tell us
about its importance. Similarly he
spoke about research which is
related to the war in Viet Nam,
and the war against peoples in
Laos and Thailand, and he said
that was something about 10 per
cent of SRl's funds.
Ten per cent of SRl's funds is
not necessarily all one needs to
know about that research in
order to understand how to make
a moral decision upon it.
Inputs And Consequences
The fact is that the inputs to
the research can be completely
unrelated to the consequences of
the research, and the
consequences of that research are
monstrous and are huge, and
should not be measured just in
terms of the perspective of SRI, in
which case it's only 10 per cent. It
should be very easy for them to
get rid of that, and we would
welcome that case. But the fact
remains that this is research which
up to now we have been
producing as members of a
community. We would sit by and
cooperate with the research, even
encourage the people who do the
research, and we must now
understand the research in that
context.
So let me get right to the
point. The Black Student Union
came up here and proposed that
they should have decision-making
power in the future of the
research at SRI. The logic behind
that can be made perfectly clear.
The consequences of the research
affect thousands of people all over
the world about whom we know
absolutely nothing. Inherently we
don't know anything about Viet
Nam, we can try to learn about
Viet Nam, we can do research on
Viet Nam, but do we know what
it's like to be a Vietnamese? Do
we know what it's like to be
bombed? And do we know what
it's like to press a political point
in Viet Nam and find an American
disagreeing with you, and because
he has the techniques, because he
has the weapons, you lose.
Black Comprehension
The only people in this
country who come even close to
understanding the situation which
we are producing by that research
are the black people in this
country, and they are now getting
to the point of telling us about it.
Maybe they're asking even
more of us than we deserve; they
talk to us as though we can
actually listen. They talk to us as
though we will understand what
they are saying, and yet the very
reason that they have to talk to us
is because for the longest time, we
have not been able to understand.

We have not even known that we
ought to understand. We look
completely at our actions on the
basis of how it affects us.
"Ten per cent? All right,
perhaps the research is a little bit
improper; we'd like to keep it, but
if we have to get rid of it, we'll get
rid of it."
Crux Of Problem
And that that should be the
majority report, that that should
be the way that the responsible
institutions of this University
present to the entire community
the importance of that research, is
the problem that we're all facing.
The actual nature of the
research in terms of consequences,
in terms of the moral concerns
that it raises were not apparent to
us while we were a quiet,
deliberative, intellectual
community. Those people who
did recognize the consequences of
the research, those people who
did look at the total activity that
we were encouraging and
promoting on this campus, had to
take it upon themselves to
announce to the rest of us that
there is something more going on
there than we were able to admit.
And the way, unfortunately,
that people are awakened in our
society to concern about an issue
is through crisis.
The people in the Coalition,
and those in the SDS before them,
had to artificially create a crisis
because the issue itself was not
apparent to the rest of the people
in the community.
Moral Imperative
Let us face it. We are all sitting
here, Friday afternoon, April 18.
Why? Was it because the members
of our elected government, the
student council representatives,
the ASSU, recognized the moral
imperative of this issue,
independent of the politics of this
University? Was it really that the
democratic processes were so
good that we could all understand
that we ought to start setting
aside some days to talk about his
issue? Or was it because there was
a crisis on this campus, which
came in the form of a sit-in,—a
sit-in under a great deal of
restraint—and that we, all of us,
could only sit down to think
about what's happening to people
around the rest of the world, and
what we are doing to those people
around the rest of the world,
when our lives were affected.
It seems to me that is the
lesson, and it's a sad lesson, but
it's a true lesson. And if anyone
should have doubts about the
justification of a sit-in, the doubts
should not be what will happen to
us if we allow disruptive tactics.
That's the question for the
future. The question we have to
worry about right now, before we
can even hope to get to a future,
is what has happened to us, in the
way we run our lives, in the way
we make choices about our lives
and the choices that affect other
peoples' lives, when the moral
import and the true results of our
actions are not enough in
themselves for us to sit down here
and take deliberative action.
We have to try to understand
why our faith in the democratic
process is not enough to tell us
about what's really going on. I'm
not saying I understand it
completely myself, but I am
saying that those people who
started the sit-in raised it to us.
We are a people who react only
to crisis. We are people who, when
we write in what we think are
ways of informing each
other—newspapers—only put on
the front pages what's making
trouble, not what's important.
The only time the San Francisco
Chronicle which is, you know,
one of the best papers around
here, began to concern itself with
the kinds of research that were
going on at SRI, was after there
was a sit-in.
Everybody can say "Yes, yes, I
agree with your goals; I agree with
your concern; I don't agree with
your tactics." But the truth is, we
wouldn't even have been talking
about the goals or the concerns
until this slight removal from our
normal procedure made us aware
of the lies we were living in.
