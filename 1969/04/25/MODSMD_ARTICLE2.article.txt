# Senate Research Resolution Text
## 
### 
Resoived:
1. That the principle of openness in research—the
principle of freedom of access by all interested
persons to the underlying data, to the processes, and
to the final results of research—is one of overriding
importance. Accordingly it is the decision of the
Senate that that principle be implemented to the
fullest extent practicable, and that no program of
research that requires secrecy (as hereafter defined)
be conducted at Stanford niversity, subject to the
exceptions set forth in Paragraph 4 of this
Resolution.
2. That a research program shall be regarded as
requiring secrecy (a) if any part of the sponsoring or
granting documents that establish the project is not
freely publishable, or (b) if there is a reasonable basis
for expectation that any documents to be generated
in the course of the research project will be subjected
by an outside sponsor to restrictions on publication
for a period in excess of that reasonably required for
the sponsor to ascertain whether information he is
entitled to have treated as confidential would be
disclosed by publication, or (c) if access will be
required in the course of the project to confidential
data so centrally related to the research that a
member of the research group who was not privy to
the confidential data would be unable to participate
fully in all of the intellectually significant portions of
the project.
3. That the rules adopted by the Academic
Council on September 25, 1967, are hereby amended
and, as amended are reaffirmed:
a) No research on a thesis or dissertation should
be undertaken if, at the time the topic is set, there is
any substantial possibility that it will lead to a secret
thesis or dissertation.
b) No secret thesis or dissertation should be
accepted as the basis for a degree unless, in the
judgment of the Committee on the Graduate
Division, the imposition of secrecy could not
reasonably have been foreseen until the work was so
far advanced that modification of the thesis topic
would have resulted in substantial inequity to the
student.
c) Scholarly activities not accessible for scrutiny

by the entire Advisory Board should not be
considered in connection with appointments,
reappointments or promotions.
d) The University should enter no contract and
accept no grant to carry out research if the grant or
contract restrains the freedom of the University to
disclose (1) the existence of the contract or grant or
(2) the general nature of the inquiry to be conducted
or (3) the identity of the outside contracting or
granting entity [, or (4) the research results];
Provided, that clause (3) shali apply either (a) to
anonymous gifts or grants that do not call for the
performance of specified lines of inquiry, or (b) to
research grants or contracts from individuals or
non-governmental entities who request anonymity
out of a justifiable motivation to protect individual
privacy.
4. That a program of research, appropriate to the
University on other grounds, shall not be regarded as
unacceptable by reason of secrecy merely because
one or more of the following circumstances exist:
a) In a program of research involving the
examination, through interview techniques or
otherwise, of a living human being, reasonable
provision may be made to protect the rights of that
individual to privacy.
b) In a program of research the purposes of which
would be significantly advanced by access to
information generated elsewhere which has been
subjected to security classification, provision may be
made for security clearance and for access to that
information on the part of one or several of the
participating investigators provided that the classified
information is peripheral to the research program in
the following sense: the relationship between the
classified data and the overall research endeavor must
be sufficiently remote so that (1) a member of the
research group who did not hold a security clearance
would nevertheless be able to participate fully in all
of the intellectually significant portions of the
project; and (2) there is no substantial basis for an
expectation that any part of the final results of the
research, or any but a trivial part of the research
processes, will be subject to restriction on publication
more enduring than those described in paragraph (2).

c) In a program of research sponsored by an
outside entity, provision may be made for a short
delay in the publication of research results, the period
of delay never to exceed one year, if (1) the sponsor
has a bona fide intention to apply for a patent
covering applications of the research in a country
whose laws establish either (a) a "race-to-file" patent
system, or (b) that patentability would be destroyed
by publication earlier than as provided in the
sponsorship arrangement; and (2) the delay provided
for does not exceed that reasonably required to
accomplish the sponsor's patenting objective in that
country.
d) If, in a program of research, an outside person
or entity has made available to the investigator
confidential information, provision may be made to
preserve confidentiality and for a short delay in the
publication of research results during which time the
information source may examine the proposed
publication in order to assure that the investigator has
not disclosed, intentionally or unintentionally, any
portion of the confidential information supplied;
provided that any such provision for delay must
contain assurances from the information source that
he will conduct his review as expeditiously as
possible, that he will not attempt to thwart
publication for any reason except to protect
confidential information previously supplied, and
that he will indicate with specificity and sentence or
sentences which he contends constitute such a
disclosure.
e) If, in a program of research, private papers,
documents, diaries or analogous materials have been
provided to the investigator, provision may be made
to preserve the confidentiality of those materials for
the purpose of protecting the individual privacy of
the author, or of the addressee, or of the immediate
family of either the author or the addressee.
5. This policy shall be reviewed at least annually
by the Committee on Research Policy at one of its
meetings. This meeting and others primarily devoted
to considering a revision of research policy shall be
announced publicly through the university calendar
and other suitable means.
