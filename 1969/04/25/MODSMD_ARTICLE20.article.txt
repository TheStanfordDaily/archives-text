## Blacks, Research, And SRI 
### Leo Bazile 
(The following is a text of the
remarks made by Leo Bazile, chariman
of the Black Student Union, at the
student body meeting in Frost
Ampitheater last Friday.)
All these professors standing
up here talking about SRI and
what it's doing and the whole bit,
and everybody comes out here.
But I thought we came out
here to talk about that sit in and
that building over there and just
what the Hell you're going to do
about it; either you're going to
take another building or all the
buildings or you're going to stop;
that's all there is to it . . .
If you're in favor of people
taking buildings you should say
so; if you're in favor of them not
taking buildings you should say
so, and go home. We got no
j business sitting out here and
J talking about SRI and what it's
going to do.
Honest Researcher
This man [an SRI researcher]
was the only honest man up here.
The only one that was honest
enough to tell you that they are
not going to stop doing this, they
are not going to be governed by a
committee. So all these perfumed
proposals about people helping
him, about people getting on
committees and standing up
talking about SRI should be
governed by the people; that ain t
going to be it.
Either you're going to make
war with them people over there
or you are not. We are not going
to sit in no damn sit-in. We didn't
do it in the first place because
there was nothing that was going
to stop the research or anything
else by sitting in that sit in and
every last one of you suckers that
is sitting out here today are here
because they got that sit in and
not out of the goodness of Pitzer's
heart or any of these professors
up here and if they hadn't took
that building in the first place
you'd all be sitting on your

goddam thumbs picking buggers
out of your nose at Tresidder.
Shit.
Now the only way you're going
to bring this thing to some kind of
head, is make up your minds that
you're going to go home and
study or you're going to stand up
and fight these people.
Intellectual Masturbation
Now, I don't get many claps
when you start talking about
fighting. Uh? No, you want to sit
around here and talk, have
intellectual masturbation about
the goodness of the people of the
Third World. In the mean time,
the people of the Third World are
still dieing and you suckers are
sitting out here in the sun trying
to get black like me.
Now we are going to tell you
where you stand. I'm going to
read this statement and we are
going to have our say; so nobody
all the way from SDS all the way
down to agent Denis Hayes and all
the rest of them can come up and
ask us where we stand. Because
you came in here and you sat
down and you got the things
being, you got your whole
movement being dampened by a
bunch of wet blankets about
Fullbright and al! the rest of
them, you know, just laying for
that Research Institute.
One, we are morally (Wow!),
we are morally opposed to the
performance of counter
insurgency, chemical and
biological research, by any and all
employees since we realize that
the performance of such research
is inseparable from the conduct of
military-political aggression
against people of the Third World,
both at home and abroad.
We consider the Stanford
Board of Trustees as a symbol of
racist-imperialist America.
Through their economic and
political power, they are
perpetuating inhuman conditions
at home in our community and

abroad by aiding in, if not backing,
the devastation of the lives and
homes of the people of Southeast
Asia, America in the ghettos,
South America, Africa, and Not
Europe.
No Compromise
We will not be compromised.
We will not be compromised by
the sale of SRI to a private group
because of our moral commitment
requires that institutions be
transformed to deal with the
realities of our situation in this
country and in the world. Our
commitment does not stop
because the desk is shuffled
between partners involved in the
same game. As the owner of SRI,
this university can and must stop
their contribution to the common
insanity of the White House, the
Congress, and the Pentagon.
We recognize that Black People
have often joined Whites searching
for social reform. But just as
often, social reform never comes.
For this reason, we are very
cautious of the April Third
Movement; but we are, on the
other hand, seriously opposed to
the racism of SRI and the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Therefore, we steadfastly commit
ourselves to the following position
in regard to the future
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI.
Position on SRI
Firstly, that SRI not be sold,
but be brought under tight
control of the University
community.
Secondly, that the Black
community, that is, that the Black
Student Union be given some
unilateral role within the decision
making process by which the
future SRI will be determined.
And third, I'd like to say for
myself, that you got a problem
right across the freeway in East
Palo Alto, and I would like to see
SRI turn all of their professors,
expertise, models, theories,
hypocrises, and all of that and
make that a community that we
can look to and say, Now, that's
what we can do when we do some
research. Otherwise, if you're not
ready to fight, (extended
applause) Now you can sit down.
We don't have to stand up here
and have standing ovations. The
thing that we got to make up our
minds is whether to fight or not
to fight. Now if you're going to
fight, you don't have to stand up
here and have a bunch of ballots
going around, because I'll go get
ten thousand of the suckers run
off and stack the box like
everybody else is doing around
here. No, it's not funny; we're out
here supposed to be exercising the
democratic processes and this
thing is just about as loose-knit
and unconcerned as this damn
board of trustees that runs this
school. Now the thing that we've
got to do is make up our minds
whether we're going to fight. I am
not going to sit in and sit in a
damn building getting funkey and
fleas and stuff carrying on all over
me just so that we can come out
here and have a meeting and let of
bunch of old wet blanket
professors stand up and tell me
that "We're going to do better." I
want to know if you're going to
take buildings around here, if
those people threaten to come in
those buildings and get you, then
damn it when they come in and
get you I want you to know that
I'll be right there with you to help
fight. But until that time I'm not
going to sit in a building wasting
my time. I'd rather sit over and
study or do whatever else I came
here for. And all this intellectual
debating, masturbation, and
words is Bullshit.

read this statement and we are
going to have our say; so nobody
all the way from SDS all the way
down to agent Denis Hayes and all
the rest of them can come up and
ask us where we stand. Because
you came in here and you sat
down and you got the things
being, you got your whole
movement being dampened by a
bunch of wet blankets about
Fullbright and al! the rest of
them, you know, just laying for
that Research Institute.
One, we are morally (Wow!),
we are morally opposed to the
performance of counter
insurgency, chemical and
biological research, by any and all
employees since we realize that
the performance of such research
is inseparable from the conduct of
military-political aggression
against people of the Third World,
both at home and abroad.
We consider the Stanford
Board of Trustees as a symbol of
racist-imperialist America.
Through their economic and
political power, they are
perpetuating inhuman conditions
at home in our community and

abroad by aiding in, if not backing,
the devastation of the lives and
homes of the people of Southeast
Asia, America in the ghettos,
South America, Africa, and Not
Europe.
No Compromise
We will not be compromised.
We will not be compromised by
the sale of SRI to a private group
because of our moral commitment
requires that institutions be
transformed to deal with the
realities of our situation in this
country and in the world. Our
commitment does not stop
because the desk is shuffled
between partners involved in the
same game. As the owner of SRI,
this university can and must stop
their contribution to the common
insanity of the White House, the
Congress, and the Pentagon.
We recognize that Black People
have often joined Whites searching
for social reform. But just as
often, social reform never comes.
For this reason, we are very
cautious of the April Third
Movement; but we are, on the
other hand, seriously opposed to
the racism of SRI and the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Therefore, we steadfastly commit
ourselves to the following position
in regard to the future
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI.
Position on SRI
Firstly, that SRI not be sold,
but be brought under tight
control of the University
community.
Secondly, that the Black
community, that is, that the Black
Student Union be given some
unilateral role within the decision
making process by which the
future SRI will be determined.
And third, I'd like to say for
myself, that you got a problem
right across the freeway in East
Palo Alto, and I would like to see
SRI turn all of their professors,
expertise, models, theories,
hypocrises, and all of that and
make that a community that we
can look to and say, Now, that's
what we can do when we do some
research. Otherwise, if you're not
ready to fight, (extended
applause) Now you can sit down.
We don't have to stand up here
and have standing ovations. The
thing that we got to make up our
minds is whether to fight or not
to fight. Now if you're going to
fight, you don't have to stand up
here and have a bunch of ballots
going around, because I'll go get
ten thousand of the suckers run
off and stack the box like
everybody else is doing around
here. No, it's not funny; we're out
here supposed to be exercising the
democratic processes and this
thing is just about as loose-knit
and unconcerned as this damn
board of trustees that runs this
school. Now the thing that we've
got to do is make up our minds
whether we're going to fight. I am
not going to sit in and sit in a
damn building getting funkey and
fleas and stuff carrying on all over
me just so that we can come out
here and have a meeting and let of
bunch of old wet blanket
professors stand up and tell me
that "We're going to do better." I
want to know if you're going to
take buildings around here, if
those people threaten to come in
those buildings and get you, then
damn it when they come in and
get you I want you to know that
I'll be right there with you to help
fight. But until that time I'm not
going to sit in a building wasting
my time. I'd rather sit over and
study or do whatever else I came
here for. And all this intellectual
debating, masturbation, and
words is Bullshit.
(The following is a text of the
remarks made by Leo Bazile, chariman
of the Black Student Union, at the
student body meeting in Frost
Ampitheater last Friday.)
All these professors standing
up here talking about SRI and
what it's doing and the whole bit,
and everybody comes out here.
But I thought we came out
here to talk about that sit in and
that building over there and just
what the Hell you're going to do
about it; either you're going to
take another building or all the
buildings or you're going to stop;
that's all there is to it . . .
If you're in favor of people
taking buildings you should say
so; if you're in favor of them not
taking buildings you should say
so, and go home. We got no
j business sitting out here and
J talking about SRI and what it's
going to do.
Honest Researcher
This man [an SRI researcher]
was the only honest man up here.
The only one that was honest
enough to tell you that they are
not going to stop doing this, they
are not going to be governed by a
committee. So all these perfumed
proposals about people helping
him, about people getting on
committees and standing up
talking about SRI should be
governed by the people; that ain t
going to be it.
Either you're going to make
war with them people over there
or you are not. We are not going
to sit in no damn sit-in. We didn't
do it in the first place because
there was nothing that was going
to stop the research or anything
else by sitting in that sit in and
every last one of you suckers that
is sitting out here today are here
because they got that sit in and
not out of the goodness of Pitzer's
heart or any of these professors
up here and if they hadn't took
that building in the first place
you'd all be sitting on your

goddam thumbs picking buggers
out of your nose at Tresidder.
Shit.
Now the only way you're going
to bring this thing to some kind of
head, is make up your minds that
you're going to go home and
study or you're going to stand up
and fight these people.
Intellectual Masturbation
Now, I don't get many claps
when you start talking about
fighting. Uh? No, you want to sit
around here and talk, have
intellectual masturbation about
the goodness of the people of the
Third World. In the mean time,
the people of the Third World are
still dieing and you suckers are
sitting out here in the sun trying
to get black like me.
Now we are going to tell you
where you stand. I'm going to
read this statement and we are
going to have our say; so nobody
all the way from SDS all the way
down to agent Denis Hayes and all
the rest of them can come up and

can look to and say, Now, that's
what we can do when we do some
research. Otherwise, if you're not
ready to fight, (extended
applause) Now you can sit down.
We don't have to stand up here
and have standing ovations. The
thing that we got to make up our
minds is whether to fight or not
to fight. Now if you're going to
fight, you don't have to stand up
here and have a bunch of ballots
going around, because I'll go get
ten thousand of the suckers run
off and stack the box like
everybody else is doing around
here. No, it's not funny; we're out
here supposed to be exercising the
democratic processes and this
thing is just about as loose-knit
and unconcerned as this damn
board of trustees that runs this
school. Now the thing that we've
got to do is make up our minds
whether we're going to fight. I am
not going to sit in and sit in a
damn building getting funkey and
fleas and stuff carrying on all over
me just so that we can come out
here and have a meeting and let of
bunch of old wet blanket
professors stand up and tell me
that "We're going to do better." I
want to know if you're going to
take buildings around here, if
those people threaten to come in
those buildings and get you, then
damn it when they come in and
get you I want you to know that
I'll be right there with you to help
fight. But until that time I'm not
going to sit in a building wasting
my time. I'd rather sit over and
study or do whatever else I came
here for. And all this intellectual
debating, masturbation, and
words is Bullshit.
(The following is a text of the
remarks made by Leo Bazile, chariman
of the Black Student Union, at the
student body meeting in Frost
Ampitheater last Friday.)
All these professors standing
up here talking about SRI and
what it's doing and the whole bit,
and everybody comes out here.
But I thought we came out
here to talk about that sit in and
that building over there and just
what the Hell you're going to do
about it; either you're going to
take another building or all the
buildings or you're going to stop;
that's all there is to it . . .
If you're in favor of people
taking buildings you should say
so; if you're in favor of them not
taking buildings you should say
so, and go home. We got no
j business sitting out here and
J talking about SRI and what it's
going to do.
Honest Researcher
This man [an SRI researcher]
was the only honest man up here.
The only one that was honest
enough to tell you that they are
not going to stop doing this, they
are not going to be governed by a
committee. So all these perfumed
proposals about people helping
him, about people getting on
committees and standing up
talking about SRI should be
governed by the people; that ain t
going to be it.
Either you're going to make
war with them people over there
or you are not. We are not going
to sit in no damn sit-in. We didn't
do it in the first place because
there was nothing that was going
to stop the research or anything
else by sitting in that sit in and
every last one of you suckers that
is sitting out here today are here
because they got that sit in and
not out of the goodness of Pitzer's
heart or any of these professors
up here and if they hadn't took
that building in the first place
you'd all be sitting on your

goddam thumbs picking buggers
out of your nose at Tresidder.
Shit.
Now the only way you're going
to bring this thing to some kind of
head, is make up your minds that
you're going to go home and
study or you're going to stand up
and fight these people.
Intellectual Masturbation
Now, I don't get many claps
when you start talking about
fighting. Uh? No, you want to sit
around here and talk, have
intellectual masturbation about
the goodness of the people of the
Third World. In the mean time,
the people of the Third World are
still dieing and you suckers are
sitting out here in the sun trying
to get black like me.
Now we are going to tell you
where you stand. I'm going to
read this statement and we are
going to have our say; so nobody
all the way from SDS all the way
down to agent Denis Hayes and all
the rest of them can come up and
ask us where we stand. Because
you came in here and you sat
down and you got the things
being, you got your whole
movement being dampened by a
bunch of wet blankets about
Fullbright and al! the rest of
them, you know, just laying for
that Research Institute.
One, we are morally (Wow!),
we are morally opposed to the
performance of counter
insurgency, chemical and
biological research, by any and all
employees since we realize that
the performance of such research
is inseparable from the conduct of
military-political aggression
against people of the Third World,
both at home and abroad.
We consider the Stanford
Board of Trustees as a symbol of
racist-imperialist America.
Through their economic and
political power, they are
perpetuating inhuman conditions
at home in our community and

abroad by aiding in, if not backing,
the devastation of the lives and
homes of the people of Southeast
Asia, America in the ghettos,
South America, Africa, and Not
Europe.
No Compromise
We will not be compromised.
We will not be compromised by
the sale of SRI to a private group
because of our moral commitment
requires that institutions be
transformed to deal with the
realities of our situation in this
country and in the world. Our
commitment does not stop
because the desk is shuffled
between partners involved in the
same game. As the owner of SRI,
this university can and must stop
their contribution to the common
insanity of the White House, the
Congress, and the Pentagon.
We recognize that Black People
have often joined Whites searching
for social reform. But just as
often, social reform never comes.
For this reason, we are very
cautious of the April Third
Movement; but we are, on the
other hand, seriously opposed to
the racism of SRI and the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Therefore, we steadfastly commit
ourselves to the following position
in regard to the future
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI.
Position on SRI
Firstly, that SRI not be sold,
but be brought under tight
control of the University
community.
Secondly, that the Black
community, that is, that the Black
Student Union be given some
unilateral role within the decision
making process by which the
future SRI will be determined.
And third, I'd like to say for
myself, that you got a problem
right across the freeway in East
Palo Alto, and I would like to see
SRI turn all of their professors,
expertise, models, theories,
hypocrises, and all of that and
make that a community that we
can look to and say, Now, that's
what we can do when we do some
research. Otherwise, if you're not
ready to fight, (extended
applause) Now you can sit down.
We don't have to stand up here
and have standing ovations. The
thing that we got to make up our
minds is whether to fight or not

was the only honest man up here.
The only one that was honest
enough to tell you that they are
not going to stop doing this, they
are not going to be governed by a
committee. So all these perfumed
proposals about people helping
him, about people getting on
committees and standing up
talking about SRI should be
governed by the people; that ain t
going to be it.
Either you're going to make
war with them people over there
or you are not. We are not going
to sit in no damn sit-in. We didn't
do it in the first place because
there was nothing that was going
to stop the research or anything
else by sitting in that sit in and
every last one of you suckers that
is sitting out here today are here
because they got that sit in and
not out of the goodness of Pitzer's
heart or any of these professors
up here and if they hadn't took
that building in the first place
you'd all be sitting on your

goddam thumbs picking buggers
out of your nose at Tresidder.
Shit.
Now the only way you're going
to bring this thing to some kind of
head, is make up your minds that
you're going to go home and
study or you're going to stand up
and fight these people.
Intellectual Masturbation
Now, I don't get many claps
when you start talking about
fighting. Uh? No, you want to sit
around here and talk, have
intellectual masturbation about
the goodness of the people of the
Third World. In the mean time,
the people of the Third World are
still dieing and you suckers are
sitting out here in the sun trying
to get black like me.
Now we are going to tell you
where you stand. I'm going to
read this statement and we are
going to have our say; so nobody
all the way from SDS all the way
down to agent Denis Hayes and all
the rest of them can come up and
ask us where we stand. Because
you came in here and you sat
down and you got the things
being, you got your whole
movement being dampened by a
bunch of wet blankets about
Fullbright and al! the rest of
them, you know, just laying for
that Research Institute.
One, we are morally (Wow!),
we are morally opposed to the
performance of counter
insurgency, chemical and
biological research, by any and all
employees since we realize that
the performance of such research
is inseparable from the conduct of
military-political aggression
against people of the Third World,
both at home and abroad.
We consider the Stanford
Board of Trustees as a symbol of
racist-imperialist America.
Through their economic and
political power, they are
perpetuating inhuman conditions
at home in our community and

abroad by aiding in, if not backing,
the devastation of the lives and
homes of the people of Southeast
Asia, America in the ghettos,
South America, Africa, and Not
Europe.
No Compromise
We will not be compromised.
We will not be compromised by
the sale of SRI to a private group
because of our moral commitment
requires that institutions be
transformed to deal with the
realities of our situation in this
country and in the world. Our
commitment does not stop
because the desk is shuffled
between partners involved in the
same game. As the owner of SRI,
this university can and must stop
their contribution to the common
insanity of the White House, the
Congress, and the Pentagon.
We recognize that Black People
have often joined Whites searching
for social reform. But just as
often, social reform never comes.
For this reason, we are very
cautious of the April Third
Movement; but we are, on the
other hand, seriously opposed to
the racism of SRI and the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
Therefore, we steadfastly commit
ourselves to the following position
in regard to the future
relationship between Stanford
University and SRI.
Position on SRI
Firstly, that SRI not be sold,
but be brought under tight
control of the University
community.
Secondly, that the Black
community, that is, that the Black
Student Union be given some
unilateral role within the decision
making process by which the
future SRI will be determined.
And third, I'd like to say for
myself, that you got a problem
right across the freeway in East
Palo Alto, and I would like to see
SRI turn all of their professors,
expertise, models, theories,
hypocrises, and all of that and
make that a community that we
can look to and say, Now, that's
what we can do when we do some
research. Otherwise, if you're not
ready to fight, (extended
applause) Now you can sit down.
We don't have to stand up here
and have standing ovations. The
thing that we got to make up our
minds is whether to fight or not
to fight. Now if you're going to
fight, you don't have to stand up
here and have a bunch of ballots
going around, because I'll go get
ten thousand of the suckers run
off and stack the box like
everybody else is doing around
here. No, it's not funny; we're out
here supposed to be exercising the
democratic processes and this
thing is just about as loose-knit
and unconcerned as this damn
board of trustees that runs this
school. Now the thing that we've
got to do is make up our minds
whether we're going to fight. I am
not going to sit in and sit in a
damn building getting funkey and
fleas and stuff carrying on all over
me just so that we can come out
here and have a meeting and let of
bunch of old wet blanket
professors stand up and tell me
that "We're going to do better." I
want to know if you're going to
take buildings around here, if
those people threaten to come in
those buildings and get you, then
damn it when they come in and
get you I want you to know that
I'll be right there with you to help
fight. But until that time I'm not
going to sit in a building wasting
my time. I'd rather sit over and
study or do whatever else I came
here for. And all this intellectual
debating, masturbation, and
words is Bullshit.
