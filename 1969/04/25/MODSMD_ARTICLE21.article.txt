# Daily Staff Shifts
## 
### 
Some shifts in Daily executive
positions were announced
yesterday by editor Philip
Taubman.
Due to academic pressures and
a year of unrelenting late hours in
the office, Craig Wilson was
named an associate editor, leaving
the post of news editor at his own
request. Wilson is a junior
majoring in English.
Margie Wolf, a sophomore in
Communications, joins Wilson as
an associate editor, shifting from
her former position of editorial
page editor. The change is at her
request. Miss Wolf requested more

opportunity to write.
To replace Wilson in the news
office, Taubman has appointed
Dennis Perluss and Brooke
Shearer as news editors. They will
work with Lang Atwood, already
a news editor. Perluss is a junior
majoring in history and Miss
Shearer is a freshman.
Douglas Anderson, also a
freshman, will take over as
editorial page editor.
In the photo office, Jim
Stimmell has assumed the title of
photo editor. He replaces Bill
Hudson who retired to pursue his
study in engineering.
