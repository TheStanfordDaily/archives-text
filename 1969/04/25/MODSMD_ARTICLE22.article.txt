# 15% Increase
## Black Enrollment Up 
### BRAD CORNELL 
Seven percent of the Stanford
freshman class of 1970 may be
black.
A record 93 black students
have been accepted for entrance
next fall, but Douglas Walker,
Director of Freshman Admissions,
estimates that only 70 to 75 of
these students will enroll, yielding
a 5% black class. This 5% figure
represents a 15% increase over last
year's black enrollment.
Though keeping up with the
nation-wide university trend
toward accepting more black
students, Stanford, in contrast to
the Ivy League schools, does not
compare favorably on black
admission policy. The average
increase in black acceptance for
the Ivy League schools is 89%,
and for some university such as
Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, and
Yale the increase in over 100%.
If all the black students

accepted by the Ivy League
campuses were to enroll, they
would comprise 13% of their
respective entering classes. Even
when this figure is corrected to
include only the number of black
students who, based on previous
statistics, are likely to enroll there
would be a 10% black class, which
is close to the proportion of
blacks in the population of this
country.
Though the Ivy League schools
outdo Stanford in black
admissions, Stanford is
nevertheless at or near the top of
several categories related to black
admissions. In number of
applications received from blacks,
Stanford, with 9,300, ranks
second, behind Yale's 10,050 but
ahead of Harvard's 8.518. In
addition, the average high school
GPA of the entering Stanford
freshman is higher than that of his
Ivy League counterpart.

Another measure is the ratio of
the number of students accepted
to the number of students who
actually enroll. Over 85% of the
students accepted by Harvard
decide to enroll at Harvard. At
Yale and Stanford this figure is
about 72%, while Princeton and
Penn enroll about 62% of those
accepted.
Enrollment Half Caiifornian
As has been the case for the
last several years, half of the
students accepted to Stanford are
from California. The next five
states in number of acceptances
are Washington, Illinois, Oregon,
New York, and Texas.
In discussing the freshman class
of 1970, Mr. Walker also noted
that about 40% of the enrolees
will be on scholarships of some
sort. Stanford assures financial aid
to any student who is accepted
and can demonstrate financial
need.

admissions, Stanford is
nevertheless at or near the top of
several categories related to black
admissions. In number of
applications received from blacks,
Stanford, with 9,300, ranks
second, behind Yale's 10,050 but
ahead of Harvard's 8.518. In
addition, the average high school
GPA of the entering Stanford
freshman is higher than that of his
Ivy League counterpart.

Another measure is the ratio of
the number of students accepted
to the number of students who
actually enroll. Over 85% of the
students accepted by Harvard
decide to enroll at Harvard. At
Yale and Stanford this figure is
about 72%, while Princeton and
Penn enroll about 62% of those
accepted.
Enrollment Half Caiifornian
As has been the case for the
last several years, half of the
students accepted to Stanford are
from California. The next five
states in number of acceptances
are Washington, Illinois, Oregon,
New York, and Texas.
In discussing the freshman class
of 1970, Mr. Walker also noted
that about 40% of the enrolees
will be on scholarships of some
sort. Stanford assures financial aid
to any student who is accepted
and can demonstrate financial
need.
Seven percent of the Stanford
freshman class of 1970 may be
black.
A record 93 black students
have been accepted for entrance
next fall, but Douglas Walker,
Director of Freshman Admissions,
estimates that only 70 to 75 of
these students will enroll, yielding
a 5% black class. This 5% figure
represents a 15% increase over last
year's black enrollment.
Though keeping up with the
nation-wide university trend
toward accepting more black
students, Stanford, in contrast to
the Ivy League schools, does not
compare favorably on black
admission policy. The average
increase in black acceptance for
the Ivy League schools is 89%,
and for some university such as
Brown, Dartmouth, Harvard, and
Yale the increase in over 100%.
If all the black students

accepted by the Ivy League
campuses were to enroll, they
would comprise 13% of their
respective entering classes. Even
when this figure is corrected to
include only the number of black
students who, based on previous
statistics, are likely to enroll there
would be a 10% black class, which
is close to the proportion of
blacks in the population of this
country.
Though the Ivy League schools
outdo Stanford in black
admissions, Stanford is
nevertheless at or near the top of
several categories related to black
admissions. In number of
applications received from blacks,
Stanford, with 9,300, ranks
second, behind Yale's 10,050 but
ahead of Harvard's 8.518. In
