Compiled from Associated Press and The Palo Alto Times

PALO ALTO-Some 200
Cubberley High School students
ended their overnight
parent-chaperoned sleep-in
yesterday staged to protest the
resignation of William R. Jones, a
social studies teacher.
The students, nearly 300
strong when the authorized
demonstration began in the school
gym, signed a petition declaring
they would go back to class
reluctantly, and were given
permission to go home and eat
breakfast before returning to
school.
The protest concerned the
impending resignation of Jones
who has indicated that he would
resign because he has not gained
tenure. According to the school
district's charges against Jones,
tenure was denied because of
administrative infractions such as
not keeping accurate attendance
records, not reporting students'
grades on time, not returning
films to the film library on time
and allowing too much noise in
his classes.
The students, declaring that he
was an inspiring teacher, claim
that he was being forced out
because he used motion pictures
about Communist China and
manifestos from the Black
Panther Party in his classes.
Jones announced his intention
to resign Wednesday at a dismissal
hearing about refusing to accept
the district's compromise proposal
of teaching next year at Gunn or
Palo Alto High schools, without
tenure. The students rallied to his
support and during afternoon
speeches said they too should
refuse to compromise. More than
700 of Cubberley's 1,250 students
signed petitions urging his
retention.
The focus in the controversy
has now shifted to the board of
trustees who will hold a special

meeting as soon as Jones s actual
resignation has been received.
Harold Santee, district
superintendent, made an attempt
Wednesday afternoon at the
request of the students to bring
the district's board of trustees to
Cubberley for a face-to-face
meeting with the students, but
was overruled by the board's legal
representative, Leland
Stephenson, who maintained that
it would be illegal for the board to
publicly discuss the case.
At a meeting this morning with
about 50 parents and 25
Cubberley faculty members,
Santee indicated he would
recommend the board stick by
their offer to let Jones teach at
Gunn or Palo Alto on a
probationary basis.
David Stanard, Cubberley
principal, said the board could
change its position, however, and
agree to let Jones continue at
Cubberley. Stanard scheduled a
faculty senate meeting for noon
today to explore the best way to
poll teachers at Cubberley on
whether they could "live" with
Jones next year.

The protest concerned the
impending resignation of Jones
who has indicated that he would
resign because he has not gained
tenure. According to the school
district's charges against Jones,
tenure was denied because of
administrative infractions such as
not keeping accurate attendance
records, not reporting students'
grades on time, not returning
films to the film library on time
and allowing too much noise in
his classes.
The students, declaring that he
was an inspiring teacher, claim
that he was being forced out
because he used motion pictures
about Communist China and
manifestos from the Black
Panther Party in his classes.
Jones announced his intention
to resign Wednesday at a dismissal
hearing about refusing to accept
the district's compromise proposal
of teaching next year at Gunn or
Palo Alto High schools, without
tenure. The students rallied to his
support and during afternoon
speeches said they too should
refuse to compromise. More than
700 of Cubberley's 1,250 students
signed petitions urging his
retention.
The focus in the controversy
has now shifted to the board of
trustees who will hold a special

meeting as soon as Jones s actual
resignation has been received.
Harold Santee, district
superintendent, made an attempt
Wednesday afternoon at the
request of the students to bring
the district's board of trustees to
Cubberley for a face-to-face
meeting with the students, but
was overruled by the board's legal
representative, Leland
Stephenson, who maintained that
it would be illegal for the board to
publicly discuss the case.
At a meeting this morning with
about 50 parents and 25
Cubberley faculty members,
Santee indicated he would
recommend the board stick by
their offer to let Jones teach at
Gunn or Palo Alto on a
probationary basis.
David Stanard, Cubberley
principal, said the board could
change its position, however, and
agree to let Jones continue at
Cubberley. Stanard scheduled a
faculty senate meeting for noon
today to explore the best way to
poll teachers at Cubberley on
whether they could "live" with
Jones next year.

PALO ALTO-Some 200
Cubberley High School students
ended their overnight
parent-chaperoned sleep-in
yesterday staged to protest the
resignation of William R. Jones, a
social studies teacher.
The students, nearly 300
strong when the authorized
demonstration began in the school
gym, signed a petition declaring
they would go back to class
reluctantly, and were given
permission to go home and eat
breakfast before returning to
school.
