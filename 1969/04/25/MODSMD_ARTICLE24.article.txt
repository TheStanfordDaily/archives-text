(Ed. Note—The following is a text
of a letter sent by Sanford M.
Dornbusch to the members of the
Stanford chapter of the
A ssoc ia t ion of American
University Professors. The
disturbances referred to occured
at the Academic Council meeting
of Friday April 18.)
To: All Members of the Academic
Council
From: Sanford M. Dornbusch,
President
Stanford Chapter, AAUP

1. The Executive Committee
of the AAUP has voted to express
its disapproval of the
inappropriate behavior of some
members of the faculty at the last
meeting of the Academic Council.
We are specifically referring to
jeering and heckling of several
speakers. It is the responsibility of
the President of the University to
decide whether a faculty
member's comments are out of
order. If the President does not
rule them out of order, it is the
responsibility of each member of
the Academic Council to listen

attentively and treat other
members with courtesy.
2. Discussion of the issues
underlying recent unrest must cut
across the usual barriers of school,
discipline, rank, and age. The
AAUP is therefore setting up
small discussion groups whose
members are randomly selected
from the faculty. You will be
discussing these issues with
colleagues whom you now don't
know, and you will have the
opportunity to persuade and learn
from people of diverse
perspectives.
The Academic Council has
voted its formal commitment to
consideration of these issues. One
step by which members of the
Council can express their
individual commitment is by
sharing the ideas which they are
developing through discussion and
reading. We hope you will join us
in this venture by mailing back
the enclosed sheet.
Each discussion group of
twelve faculty will meet for one
evening a week for two weeks
from 8:00 to 12:00 p.m., at the
home of a faculty member. The
host's duties will be to provide
liquid refreshment and to prevent
faculty members from speaking in
50-minute sentences. It is his task
to make sure that all participate,
and that the discussion is
active but does not lead to blows.
