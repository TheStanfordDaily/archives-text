# Blacks Close CCNY
## 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
Dissident Negro students kept
the huge City College of New
York closed Thursday and shut
down predominantly Nogro
Hampton Institute.
In New York City, where
students staged protests on several
college campuses, Negro students
remained in command for the
third day of some 16 acres of
CCNY's upper Manhattan campus.
They allowed administration
officials inside to try to negotiate
a peace and agreed to let President
Buell Gallagher sleep in his own
home, which is on the barricaded
campus.
The Negro students, together
with Puerto Rican students, have
refused to let any whites, student
or faculty, on the enclosed
campus since Tuesday morning.
Classes were abandoned then. The
demonstrators are demanding
greater enrollment of minority
group students and a separate
school of black studies.

Meanwhile, 50 white students
occupying an administration
building on the other half of the
campus repulsed a band of
conservative students trying to
end their sit-in. The conservative
students tossed bottles at the
sit-ins, who are demonstrating in
support of the Negro protest.
City College, the biggest free
tuition school in the country, has
20,000 students, about 4,500 of
them Negro.
In Hampton, Va., trustees of
Hampton Institute, which enrolls
about 2,600 students, closed the
school "for an indefinite period."
Almost 100 students invaded the
administration building
Wednesday and remained.
Dr. Jerome H. Holland, the
college president and Cornell
University's only Negro
All-America football player,
refused to leave his office after
the students trooped in with
bedrolls, food and extra clothing.
