# Nitery Program Presents Plays Of Opposite Quality
## 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
The Speech and Drama
Department's current program at
the Nitery was conceived by a
schizophrenic. "The Wager," a
short play by Mark Medoff, is
everything good. It is, in fact, the
funniest play I have seen at
Stanford in the past three years.
And at the asking price (free), it's
an unbeatable way to spend an
evening. Its companion is an
adaptation of William Blake's
mystical poem "The Marriage of
Heaven and Hell." If "The Wager"
is everything good, "The Marriage
of Heaven and Hell" is, well, hell.
So let us at once lay to rest the
spirit of poor Mr. Blake, and then
get.on to sweeter things.
"The Marriage of Heaven and
Hell" is the directing debut of Jay
Morse, an undergraduate in
Speech and Drama, and I hate to
think of all the work that he put

into it, considering what came
out. Mr. Morse, in addition to
directing, also collaborated on the
adaptation (with Sandy Perry)
and designed the lights. It's a
shame that Mr. Morse chose such
a difficult work for his first
directing effort, for it is obvious
that William Blake would tax the
resources of an experienced
director. I seriously question
whether anyone could
successfully transform this poem
into theater.
Morse's Attempt Failed
Mr. Morse and his company
have made a brave attempt, but 1
am afraid that they have failed. It
is muddled; it is confused; it is, at
best, incomprehensible. It is
dark â€”not artistically dark, just
plain dark; it is clinched (I
personally have had my fill of
strobe lights); it is, worst of all,
boring. There are some good
things which must be mentioned:
Richard Carp and Pat Dillon, as
the Conscious and Dream Blake,
respectively, both have some fine
moments. The costumes, designed
by Sue Ray and Debbie
Hickenlooper, are striking and
very effective. But these are small
half-baked oases in a very wide,
monotonous desert, and as Mr.
Morse has taken so much of this
show on his shoulders,, so must he
bear most of the responsibility for
its disappointments. I can only
wish him greater wisdom in his
choice of future productions, and
great success in their realization.
"Wager" Better
"The Wager," thank goodness,
is a cat of a different stripe. I'm
not sure if it's a farce, a burlesque,
a light comedy, a satire, an
imitation of Neil Simon, or a
commentary on our decadent
society. But it is funny. Bill
Frankfather must be a very funny
man, because Bill Frankfather
both directed and stars. The
wise-cracks, the put-downs, the
incredible convolutions of the
English language, come on with
the fury of machine gun bullets.
The cast is excellent: Gene
Engene, Sam Blackwell, and Polly

Adams, along with Mr.
Frankfather, are insanely funny,
and yet they are quite real in all
of their insanity.
For those of you who are
really concerned about plots,
here's a very brief rundown: A
grad student in math bets his
English instructor roommate that
he can seduce and marry their
neighbor's wife in less than a
month, without being murdered
by the outraged husband.
Everyone in the play is a little
crazy. OK? It's playing through
Saturday night at the Nitery. Go
see it.
