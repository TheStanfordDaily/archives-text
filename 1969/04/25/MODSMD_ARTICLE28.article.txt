## "Sweet Charity": Superb Musical 
### TODD McCARTHY 
From the viewpoint of
posterity, the cinema of the
sixties will probably pride itself
for the extravagent development
of three sorts of pictures: the
"swinging," mod film, those with
heavy doses of violence, and the
big-time musical. While the social
value of the first two genres is
debatable, there have
unquestionably been a number of
films that have approached both
subjects honestly and with
considerable artistic success. The
third field, that of the giant,
multi-million dollar musical, has
produced several big Academy
Award winners and box office
record breakers. However, not
since 1961 and West Side Story,
the film that established the
70mm, reserved seat format to
movie musicals, has it produced
an exciting, emotionally
stimulating and, particularly,
wholly satisfying picture. Not,
that is, until Sweet Charity.
Taking into account bare
statistics alone, one could be led
to suspect the worst. The film is
an adaptation of a splashy
Broadway hit (which was based
on Fellini's The Nights of
Cabiria), is in "70mm/Panavision
with full dimensional sound" and
has been promoted by Universal
as something like a second
Thoroughly Modern Millie. Yet
certain details of the production
reveal that special care was taken
with this project to prevent it
from being multilated by the
Hollywood powers-at-large. Ross
Hunter was forced to resign as
producer due to arguments

concerning the purpose of making
the picture. Most significant,
however, is that Bob Fosse, who
conceived of and brilliantly stayed
the Broadway original, was asked
to make his movie directorial
debut with the project. When
directing his first film, Citizen
Kane, Orson Welles said, in
refering to the movie studio,
"This is the biggest toy any kid
ever got to play with." Fosse
seems to have adopted the same
outlook toward filmaking, for
though Charity is not innovative
the way Welles' film was, it is so
full of style and verve that the
director's free hand to try
anything he wished is clearly and
joyously in evidence.
Dismaying Reactions
1 have been dismayed at some
critics' (particularly in New York)
reactions to Sweet Charity. Some
have complained that the film is
gimmick-laden and over-produced,
throwing it in with the many
other recent films that have used
"up-to-date" methods. In
disposing of Charity, however,
these critics seem to be forgetting
that such techniques as
stop-action, slow motion and
colored frame once did and can
still have justifiable artistic
motivation and just because it is
fashionable to be "mod" does not
rule out the possibility of a film
putting the "high" back in
"high-style."
On the most basic level, Fosse
uses the so-called "tricks" to
enhance and sharpen the musical
numbers. Instead of cementing his
camera, at third row center,
orchestra, Fosse moves into the
action of a song or dance,
employing tracking shots or
alternating between individuals,
ensembles and large groups. Aside
from being technically and
aesthetically surprising and
inventive, the numbers are the
right length. In many current
musicals (notably Oliver!), the
showcase or production numbers
are stretched from their original
form to last up to 10 or 12
minutes. None in Sweet Charity
(including the exciting Sammy
Davis speciality, "Rhythm of
Life") last more than 6 or 7
minutes, which is not only
refreshing but allows the plot to
move quickly along with minimal
interference.

On a much more difficult and
rarely achieved level (never before
achieved in a musical), Fosse
greatly strengthens the emotional
impact of the film through the use
of special effects. Particular use is
made of the frozen frame, in
which a sequence is halted for a
brief moment, then resumed. This
technique has much the effect of
a held breath or skipped
heartbeat; one's hopes,
expectations or fears are
suspended for just an instant, an
instant which heightens the
emotional intensity of any
situation. Thus, when Charity's
shy, unlikely boyfriend sees her
slapped playfully in the rear by an
old friend, it is not only the actor
but the cinema medium that
relays the hurt in the young man
and his growing doubt that they
could go through with a marriage.
The entire film, despite the
splashy numbers, has a
bitter-sweet, tragicomic tone to it,
and emerges at once as the most
moving, heartbreaking and
uplifting musical this viewer can
remember.
Though Charity has a distinctly
contemporary look to it, several
of. the scenes are hauntingly
reminiscent of some of the best
musicals of the fifties. Director
Fosse's theatrical roots in such

shows (and films) as Damn
Yankees, Pajama Game and My
Sister Eileen are particularly
evident in the decor of Charity's
place of employment, the
Fan-Dango Ballroom, and in the
showy but friendly attitude taken
in such show-stoppers as "Hey,
Big Spender." An incisive new
scene added for the film, in which
Charity's legitimate bid for a
secretarial job is taken by an
employment agent as a practical
joke initiated by office pranksters,
is wonderfully evocative of the
New York "office" aura of such
pictures as The Apartment and
Days of Wine and Roses. These
vintage touches, perhaps not even
intentional, further enrich the
atmosphere of the film and
strengthen the sense of locale and
genre.
Rousing Stage Show
On stage, Sweet Charity was a
rousing show, memorable mostly
for its brilliant dancing and
exciting score. Neil Simon's book,
while amusing, was rather flippant
and shallow. Screenwriter Peter
Stone has left the major virtues of
the original intact but has treated
the love story in a particularly
tender, natural manner. Following
more closely the story and tone of
The Nights of Cabiria, Stone has
also dispensed with Simon's
pseudo-happy ending, thus
making the picture more
melancholy but much more
believable.
Shirley MacLaine, who also
worked in Broadway musicals
during the fifties, herein delivers
what may be her finest screen
performance, certainly her best in
several years. She is just as
poignant as she was in The
Apartment and just as sassy and
funny as Irma la Douce, the
combination being irresistable.
Ricardo Montalban, in a feature

part as a movie star who picks up
Charity, comes across much as
Omar Sharif did in Funny Girl.
Montalban's part consists of a
self-parody, however, and he is
marvellous in it.
The find of the picture, aside
from director Fosse, is John
McMartin, who plays an
introverted young man who finds
a rapport, and almost love, with
Charity. Though McMartin played
the part for two years on
Broadway, he has a very positive
screen presence, conveying every
nuance of hope and ultimate
disillusionment with his one
chance to break out, to fall in
love. Indeed, all the performances,
from the leads to the "dance hall
hostesses," are remarkably true
and human for a musical. The
personal element, attained by the
actors and Fosse's technique, in
combination with several of the
most stunning and enjoyable
musical numbers ever committed
to celluloid, make Sweet Charity
the most entertaining,
aesthetically and emotionally
pleasing musical to have been
released in at least eight years.
Public Reaction
The artistic success of (and
somewhat snobbish critical
reaction to) Sweet Charity makes
me apprehensive about the public
reception to the film. The typical
musical roadshow audience, used
to happy endings and the glowing
faces of marzipan-fed children,
may not respond favorably to a
tale of a middle-aged (though still
vibrant) prostitute from the
seamy side of New York City.
Hopefully, Sweet Charity will find
a new, more cultivated audience
for the musical film, for this
picture deserves the attention of
everyone with a sense of rhythm
and an appreciation of the joys of
life and the film medium.


A POWERFUL BEATâ€”Shirley MacLaine, Sammy Davis and John McMartin enjoy
the 'Rhythm of Life' in SWEET CHARITY.
