## 
### DOUGLAS ANDERSON 
One of the closest presidential races
in recent ASSU history ended last night
with the election of the"Council of
Presidents" ticket headed by Patrick
Shea. It narrowly defeated the ticket of
Bob Cory and Eckhard Schulz.
The"Council" compiled 2273 votes
to Cory's 1968.
Announced last night by Election
Commissioner Bob Debs, the vote does
not include the results of the overseas
campuses "which could change the
outcome of the election, but quite
probably will not," said Debs. "Results
of the primary election vole favored the
Shea ticket " he further explained.
"We're II very delighted at the
outcome, of course-and tired!"
responded Pat Shea for the group,
which includes Joyce Kobayashi, Barry
Askinas, and John Grube.
Cory Statement
In conceding the victory to the
Council of Presidents Bob Cory issued
the following statement:
"Eckhard and I would like to thank
those who supported us in the recent
election. We will continue to work for
those programs which we feel would
benefit the Stanford community, such
as a Department of Urban and

Environmental Studies and academic
credit for community aid projects.
"At the same time we wish to
express our confidence in Pat, John,
Barry and Joyce. We urge all students to
support their efforts in working toward
solutions of those problems for which
we all share a common concern."
"We want to congratulate Bob and
Eckhard on a well fought campaign,"
Barry Askinas said. "We hope they will
pursue the idea of an Urban
Environment Studies and community
aid programs."
Greater Involvement
Commenting on the campaign, John
Grube said for the Council, "Having
knocked on many doors the last few
days, we want to thank all those people
who supported us. Now that the
election is over, however, we hope all of
you won't forget student government,
as has been the case in the past.
"Rather we ask for a greater
involvement and participation on the
part of all students. Without this
involvement the programs we have
planned cannot be implemented."
"Pat Shea responded, "During the
campaign we have been striving toward
the idea of community decisions made
by the entire community. We are
looking forward to serving with both
the faculty and students in solving
university problems."
Joyce Kobayashi continued, "We
have all been very involved with the
Student Education Council (SEC) this
year. Educational reform is of primary
importance. The joint effort of the
Academic Senate and the SEC has
shown real potential for real community
participation in community governance
on this campus. I hope there will be
more groups like this meeting jointly
next year."
Organize ASSU First
Asked about the immediate future,
Pat Shea answered, "The first order of
business is to organize the ASSU office
and work with Denis Hayes and Dave
Swift in making the transition as
smooth as possible.
"In addition, over the period of the
next few weeks, we hope to visit all of
the living and eating groups to outline
our programs and further explain the
concept of the 'Council of Presidents."
Responding to a question on te
"legality" of the Council, Barry Askinas
said, "Although the constitution does
not make provision for such a
"Council,"it was one of the central
issues of the campaign. A vote for our
ticket was an acceptance of the
Council."
The entire group expressed a desire
to thank and to congratulate ASSU
President Denis Hayes and
Vice-President Victor von Schlegell for
"greatly enhancing the respect of the
faculty and students for the ASSU over
the months."
"We hope we can maintain the
momentum of student voice in
university affairs," they said.
Commenting on the election, Denis
Hayes said, "I am delighted at the
outcome of the election and am looking
forward to working with the Council of
Presidents during the transition period. I
am very pleased to leave the ASSU in
their hands next year."
