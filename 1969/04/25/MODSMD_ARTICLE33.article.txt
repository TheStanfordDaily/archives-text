# Toyon Sex Series
## Laws Overstep Limits 
### NEIL GOLDEN 
"One of the worst problems of
sex regulation by the law has been
that it discriminates highly against
the poor," asserted Assistant
Professor of Law Mike Wald
Wednesday night to a group of
forty students in Toyon Lounge.
Speaking on "Legal and Illegal
Aspects of Sexuality" as part of
the Toyon Sex Series, Wald
contended, as do many lawyers,

that most of the legal regulation
of sexual behavior is
"discriminatory" and that "the
law is overstepping its limits in
those areas where there are acts
between consenting people."
"It is basically discriminatory
for the law to single out certain
few people when large numbers of
people participate in these acts,"
he said, referring to legal
prohibitions of prostitution, and
homosexuality. With regard to
prostitution, "part of the
antagonism between the police
and minority groups comes
because most of the prostitution
arrests are minority persons, who
are streetwalkers and therefore
more visible. Non-minority group
prostitutes who often practice for
more money, and more
frequently, operating out of
hotels, go untouched by the law."
Wald contrasted U.S. sex laws
with those of England and
Sweden, which do not have
fornication, homosexuality, or
anti-prostitution laws. "All of
these U.S. laws have stood up in
the Supreme Court because none
have been proven to be against
any Constitutional principle."
"A lot of the basis for our sex
laws comes from historical and
religious taboos. American law has
a strong flavor of early
ecclesiastical law in the area of sex
regulation." Wald opposed the

"tremendous misallocation of
resources" which are used to
apprehend consenting adults
performing illegal sex acts, when
these resources could be applied
to murder and robbery cases.
"There is an enormous amount of
corruption in the whole system,
from peeping-tom policemen to
other illegal acts by police,
including the luring and trapping
of homosexuals and prostitutes."
Citing one example which was
familar to him from his days at
Yale, Wald mentioned the
rigorous enforcement of
Connecticut's laws concerning
"lacivious carriage," defined as
"any state of undress between
unmarried male and female
persons." He said that at times the
New Haven police have
relentlessly pursued Yale students,
following them home and
sometimes breaking into
residences, so that in one month
15 Yale students were arrested on
this charge.
"The regulation of sexual
psychopath acts is worse than
other areas," he said, due to the
vagueness of the laws and the low
standard of proof required for
conviction. In some states, a
conviction for life imprisonment
can be obtained simply on the
testimony of a psychiatrist
concerning a person's
psychopathic tendencies.

apprehend consenting adults
performing illegal sex acts, when
these resources could be applied
to murder and robbery cases.
"There is an enormous amount of
corruption in the whole system,
from peeping-tom policemen to
other illegal acts by police,
including the luring and trapping
of homosexuals and prostitutes."
Citing one example which was
familar to him from his days at
Yale, Wald mentioned the
rigorous enforcement of
Connecticut's laws concerning
"lacivious carriage," defined as
"any state of undress between
unmarried male and female
persons." He said that at times the
New Haven police have
relentlessly pursued Yale students,
following them home and
sometimes breaking into
residences, so that in one month
15 Yale students were arrested on
this charge.
"The regulation of sexual
psychopath acts is worse than
other areas," he said, due to the
vagueness of the laws and the low
standard of proof required for
conviction. In some states, a
conviction for life imprisonment
can be obtained simply on the
testimony of a psychiatrist
concerning a person's
psychopathic tendencies.
"One of the worst problems of
sex regulation by the law has been
that it discriminates highly against
the poor," asserted Assistant
Professor of Law Mike Wald
Wednesday night to a group of
forty students in Toyon Lounge.
Speaking on "Legal and Illegal
Aspects of Sexuality" as part of
the Toyon Sex Series, Wald
contended, as do many lawyers,

that most of the legal regulation
of sexual behavior is
"discriminatory" and that "the
law is overstepping its limits in
those areas where there are acts
between consenting people."
"It is basically discriminatory
for the law to single out certain
few people when large numbers of
people participate in these acts,"
he said, referring to legal
prohibitions of prostitution, and
homosexuality. With regard to
prostitution, "part of the
antagonism between the police
and minority groups comes
because most of the prostitution
arrests are minority persons, who
are streetwalkers and therefore
more visible. Non-minority group
prostitutes who often practice for
more money, and more
frequently, operating out of
hotels, go untouched by the law."
Wald contrasted U.S. sex laws
with those of England and
Sweden, which do not have
fornication, homosexuality, or
anti-prostitution laws. "All of
these U.S. laws have stood up in
the Supreme Court because none
have been proven to be against
any Constitutional principle."
"A lot of the basis for our sex
laws comes from historical and
religious taboos. American law has
a strong flavor of early
ecclesiastical law in the area of sex
regulation." Wald opposed the

"tremendous misallocation of
resources" which are used to
apprehend consenting adults
performing illegal sex acts, when
these resources could be applied
to murder and robbery cases.
