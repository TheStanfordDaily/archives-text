# T.V. Depicts Stanford, "University In Society"
## 
### 
Stanford students will be
shown on television Channel 13,
this Sunday evening at 8 p.m. in a
film depicting Stanford as a
microcosm of the agony of the
American university.
The Public Broadcast
Laboratory filmed the show
throughout the winter. The
broadcast, "University in Society:
Do the Ties Bind?", is in two
parts.
The first part, "Reform before
Revolution," traces efforts of the
campus administration and
faculty to adapt to changing
conditions and to give students a
larger role in determining their
program of studies.
"Fathers and Sons" is the
second part, and it follows
members of the Students for a
Democratic Society as they
prepare a challenge to the
university.
"Reform before Revolution"
follows efforts of the Stanford
administration to keep lines open
to Federal funds. The film shows
President Pitzer conferring with
congressmen about funding.
Administrators are also shown
commenting on applications of
the recently-completed SES
report.
"Fathers and Sons" shows SDS
members deliberating over what

tactics to adopt and what goals to
pursue. The film also shows the
SDSers demonstrating at San
Francisco State.
The film also shows the
members in an encounter with
President Pitzer, as well as one of
their outings to Big Sur. The film
focuses on the manners and the
life-styles of Stanford's radicals,
because many are heirs of the

corporate elite against whom
much of their activity is directed.
The confrontation with the
trustees in March was also filmed.
The SDSers are shown first
occupying a board room and later
challenging the meeting with
demands hollered through
bullhorns.
The results of the camera crews
will be broadcast in color.
