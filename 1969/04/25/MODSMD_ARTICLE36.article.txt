# Japanese Film
## 
### 
A different kind of anti-war
film will be shown Friday night.
"The Burmese Harp," directed
by Kon Ichikawa, will be
presented twice Friday night at
7:30 and 10:00 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium Admission is 75c for
students and $1.00 for the general
public.
In the midst of foreign terrain,
alien peoples, and the emotions of
war, it is the magic of song that
makes each obstacle tolerable and
gives the Japanese soldiers a will
to live, once the defeat of the war
was realized.
