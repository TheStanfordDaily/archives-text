## Tennis Men In Ojai 
### FRED MANN 
Stanford's luckless varsity and
two tremendous frosh tennis
players will spend the weekend
just as they have yesterday and
today, swinging at tennis balls in
Ojai, California.
The banishment to glamorous
Ojai is for the annual tournament,
running four days. Coach Dick
Gould's varsity will be facing
some of the top competition in
the west, and also will be hoping
to jump the net for a change.
They will be suplemented by Mac
Clafin and Rick Evans from the
freshman team.
Playing one of the toughest
schedules in the country, the
netters have not fared well. Last
weekend, UCLA and USC both
nailed the Indians, and Tuesday,
the Tribe was faced with San Jose
State, perhaps the best squad in
Northern California.
Stanford played well and split
the six singles matches, but lost all

three doubles, and dropped the
meeting, 6-3.
Top man Dean Schlobohm fell
in straight sets to the Spartans'
Greg Shephard, 7-5, 6-4, and
number two player Stan Pasarell
fared little better. He went three
sets with John Swieg before
losing, 4-6, 6-2, 6-2.
Again it was John Spiegel,
continuing his outstanding play,
that led the Stanford surge.
Spiegel won in straight sets while
Paul Marienthal and Chuck Aloo
went the distance for wins.
