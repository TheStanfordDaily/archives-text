## Big Game Returns 
### 
The Stanford lacrosse coaching
staff hopes that their charges
won't be looking ahead a week to
their big Denver trip when the
Indians face the University of
California up at Berkeley
tomorrow at 2:00.

It will be the opening game in
the traditional home-and-home
series for the Amberchrombie &
Fitch Broken Stick Trophy. The
undefeated Indians have won the
trophy three straight years and are
scheduled to repeat again, but the
Bears could provide them with
some surprises.
Cal started off the season as
the weakling of the Northern
California Lacrosse Association
and Stanford has been the giant.
But in their last outing, the Bears
solidly beat the Marin Lacrosse
Club, 8-1, and if they find the
Indians playing a week ahead of
themselves, they could give them
trouble.
Stanford will be in Colorado
the first weekend in May for
games with the University of
Denver on Friday and the Air
Force Academy on Saturday. The
Stanford-Air Force game has
come to be the highlight of the
western region lacrosse season.
Although Cal is entertaining
high hopes for this game, they are
sure to have their hands full; the
Tribe has scored 64 goals this
season to their opponents' 8.
