# Crew Vs. St. Mary's
## 
### 
Hoping to bounce back from
last week's defeat at the hands of
the Washington Huskies, the
Stanford crew meets the St.
Mary's Gaels this Saturday at the
Oakland Estuary. The race will be
a warm-up of sorts, as the Indian
oarsmen prepare for next
weekend's twin tests against
UCLA and UC Irvine in Los
Angeles.
The loss to Washington came
on very rough water at the
University of Oregon's home at
Eugene in a race that also involved
Oregon State and Pacific Lutheran
University. The Indians jumped
out to a five-seat lead at the start
but could not hold it, as the
Huskies pulled even at the
half-way mark. Stanford then
tried to take the stroke up but the
water conditions were too rough,
and Washington, rowing at a lower
and more efficient beat, went on
to win by a length.
Next week's races in the
Southland will be crucial in
determining the success of this
season for the Stanford rowers.
Both the Bruins (in the Harbach
Cup Friday) and the Irvine
Anteaters (in the Newport
Regatta Saturday) have beaten Cal
and are among the best crews on
the coast. Victories in both of
these races are essential if the
Indians are to have any hope of
avenging the loss to Washington
and winning the Western Sprints.
