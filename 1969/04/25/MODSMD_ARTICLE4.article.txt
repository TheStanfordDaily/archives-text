# On SRI Question
## Fuller Sets April 30 For Hearing 
### 
Plans for a campus hearing on the
relations between Stanford Research
Institute and Stanford University were
announced yesterday by W. Parmer
Fuller 111, president of the Board of
Trustees.
A five-man trustee committee headed
by Attorney Morris Doyle of San
Francisco will hear testimony from SRI
officers and employees, Stanford
faculty and Stanford students
Wednesday, April 30, Fuller said.
Recommended by the University
Advisory Committee, a
student-faculty-trustee group, at a
meeting on March 31, the hearing was
approved by the trustees of their
meeting on April 8.
At that time, the Board said that
"selected representatives of divergent
positions should be invited to present
their views to a committee of the Board.
This session might well be published,
broadcast, or televised on closed circuit
television, but no votes shall be taken at
this hearing."
Fuller's statement yesterday

however, was not clear how many, or if
any student observers will be allowed to
attend the hearing next week.
Besides Doyle, other members of the
trustee committee will be Mrs. Allan
Charles, Richard Guggenhime, Robert
Minge Brown, and Ben. Duniway. The
proceedings will be broadcast on
campus radio station KZSU.
The committee's schedule includes
testimony from SRI, to be coordinated
through the University Relations office;
from students, to be coordinated by the
Dean of Student's office in consultation

with the Associated Students
Committee on Nominations; and from
faculty, to be coordinated by the
Academic Secretary in consultation
with the Steering Committee of the
Senate of the Academic Council.
Commenting on the plans, President
Kenneth Pitzer said: "I have assured the
trustees through their committee
chairman that order and decorum will
be maintained throughout the hearing,
and have made it clear that we will not
proceed without that condition."
