## Tribe Runs In Oregon 
### 
For the fifth week in a row the
Indian spikers face one of the top
ten teams in the nation. This
week's encounter takes place at
Eugene, the home ground of the
Bill Bowerman-coached Oregon
Webfoots.
Two weeks ago Oregon took
USC to the final event of the
day—the mile relay—before
succumbing to the powerful
Trojans who last week overwhelmed
the Tribe.
But as exciting as dual meets
are, the final conference placings
are determined in the Pac-8 round
up May 16-17 at Corvallis. No one
knows this better than Bowerman
who two years ago won the
conference after failing to notch a
dual meet victory.
Oregon's traditional strength
lies in the distance events and if
Stanford plans to stay in the meet
Coach Marshall Clark's distance
crew will have to avoid sweeps in
these races. In the USC meet the
Ducks scored 29 out of 36 of the
endurance points. The Tribe will
have to do better than this.
In the mile Allen Sanford
(4:06.4) faces the only two faster
runners in the conference—Arne
Kualheim (4:01) and Roscoe
Divine (4:04.1). While in the
steeplechase, the Ducks who are
traditionally strong in the water

event, have the top three times
with Indian Brook Thomas
fourth.
But to outscore the Webfoots,
Stanford will have to dominate
the sprints with Rick Tipton and
Fred Storek, as well as the high
jump with Peter Boyce, Tom
Massey and Dave Harper.
The hurdles again constitute a
key event because of the presence
of Australian Gary Knoke in both
the highs and intermediates. It
will be up to sophomores Tipton
and Randy White to extend the
Aussie to the limit.
Other "if" events are the pole

vault where Clint Ostrander is in
quest of a seasonal best of 15'6"
and the discus where the
amazingly consistant Steve Davis
goes for his third straight triumph.
Coach Jordan also counts on a
strong show in the javelin from
Tom Colby, recovered from last
week's groin injury, and the USC
meet winner Lance Martin.
If the scoring trend turns to
the Indians the outcome could
conceivably come down to the
mile relay. Here the Ducks have a
three second edge, but Stanford
has yet to reach their potential in
this event. The personnel is there
for an upset.

Coach Jordan also counts on a
strong show in the javelin from
Tom Colby, recovered from last
week's groin injury, and the USC
meet winner Lance Martin.
If the scoring trend turns to
the Indians the outcome could
conceivably come down to the
mile relay. Here the Ducks have a
three second edge, but Stanford
has yet to reach their potential in
this event. The personnel is there
for an upset.

For the fifth week in a row the
Indian spikers face one of the top
ten teams in the nation. This
week's encounter takes place at
Eugene, the home ground of the
Bill Bowerman-coached Oregon
Webfoots.
Two weeks ago Oregon took
USC to the final event of the
day—the mile relay—before
succumbing to the powerful
Trojans who last week overwhelmed
the Tribe.
But as exciting as dual meets
are, the final conference placings
are determined in the Pac-8 round
up May 16-17 at Corvallis. No one
knows this better than Bowerman
who two years ago won the
conference after failing to notch a
dual meet victory.
Oregon's traditional strength
lies in the distance events and if
Stanford plans to stay in the meet
Coach Marshall Clark's distance
crew will have to avoid sweeps in
these races. In the USC meet the
Ducks scored 29 out of 36 of the
endurance points. The Tribe will
have to do better than this.
In the mile Allen Sanford
(4:06.4) faces the only two faster
runners in the conference—Arne
Kualheim (4:01) and Roscoe
Divine (4:04.1). While in the
steeplechase, the Ducks who are
traditionally strong in the water

event, have the top three times
with Indian Brook Thomas
fourth.
But to outscore the Webfoots,
Stanford will have to dominate
the sprints with Rick Tipton and
Fred Storek, as well as the high
jump with Peter Boyce, Tom
Massey and Dave Harper.
The hurdles again constitute a
key event because of the presence
of Australian Gary Knoke in both
the highs and intermediates. It
will be up to sophomores Tipton
and Randy White to extend the
Aussie to the limit.
Other "if" events are the pole

vault where Clint Ostrander is in
quest of a seasonal best of 15'6"
and the discus where the
amazingly consistant Steve Davis
goes for his third straight triumph.
Coach Jordan also counts on a
strong show in the javelin from
Tom Colby, recovered from last
week's groin injury, and the USC
meet winner Lance Martin.
If the scoring trend turns to
the Indians the outcome could
conceivably come down to the
mile relay. Here the Ducks have a
three second edge, but Stanford
has yet to reach their potential in
this event. The personnel is there
