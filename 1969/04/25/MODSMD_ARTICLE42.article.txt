The (mighty —powerful —
vaunted) (choose one) University
of Southern California Trojans
visit (The Farm—Stanford—Palo
Alto) today to take on the
(Indians—Cards—Tribe) in what
will probably be the most
important (game—meet) for
Coach (John Ralston's—Jim
Gaughran's—Ray Young's) squad
this season. The Trojans are led by
(O.J. Simpson—Andy Strenk—Bill
Seinsoth) and today's contest
promises to be one of the
outstanding (football
games —swim meets - baseball
games) played this year.
Yes, fans, here comes S.C. and,
as usual, it's a big one. Stanford
and the Trojans are currently tied
for the Pac-8 baseball lead with
records of seven wins and two
losses. Coach Young will send
right hander Bob Boone against
SC in this afternoon's game, then
will go with Phil Keller and Rod
Poteete in a double header against
UCLA tomorrow.
Earlier this month the Tribe
split a pair with the Trojans and
defeated the Bruins. Stanford was
beaten by SC's Jim Barr, who
might pitch again today.
Otherwise, it's likely to be Brent
Stromm. The condition of Trojan
first baseman Seinsoth, who was
hit in the face by a pitch on
Monday, is unknown in these
parts. So far this year Seinsoth has

hit 12 homers and driven in 47
runs. The Tribe, meanwhile, is
peaked for the games, and isn't
currently bothered with any
medical problems.
It should be an interesting
weekend.
