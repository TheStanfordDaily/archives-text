The defending champion
Stanford Indians are underway
hosting the second annual U.S.
Collegiate Invitational golf
championships on the Stanford
course. Again, the Tribe is the
team to beat.
The competition running
through tomorrow features the
top clubs in the nation, with San
Jose State and USC the prime
threats to Bud Finger's Indians.
Other outstanding teams include
Seattle, Washington, OSU, and
Northern Illinois.

Defending individual
champion, Stanford's Sandy
Adelman will be pressed to repeat
by teammates Tom Watson and
co-captain Greg Pitzer. Watson has
become the Tribe's top man this
year as a sophomore, and should
be favored.
Last year Adelman shot a 214,
one over par for the 54 holes,
while Watson finished at 219.
