# LASSU Signs Its Death Warrant
## 
### 
Student legislators last night
validated the results of the recent ASSU
elections. In doing so, they signed their
own death warrant.
Along with approving the votes on
the ASSU presidency race and a housing
referendum, LASSU members accepted
the results of the vote on the new
constitution. That document includes
the replacement of LASSU with a
40-member student Senate.
The entire meeting was
non-controversial, with the legislators
reflecting the fact that the end is near
for the time-worn institution. Speaker
Yale Braunstein added his plea for a
placid meeting, declaring that a sore
throat would severely limit his
leadership powers.
Controversy arose at the end of the

meeting, when a bill was presented that
would end use of the proxy by
substitutes for legislators who were
absent. It has been charged that the
Speech Association stacked a LASSU
meeting with proxy voters who pushed
through a large appropriation to the
speech group.
Soon after the bill was presented, a
member of the legislature's conservative
bloc suggested the absence of a quorum.
With only 40 of 150 members present,
Speaker Braunstein was forced to
immediately adjourn the meeting.
Earlier, the legislature approved $500
in order to bring the Lagunita
boathouse up to state safety standards,
including the purchase of life-jackets
and <i rowboat. The appropriation stems
from a recent drowning on the lake. The
bill also called for negotiations with the

administration for additional funds for
extra safety devices.
LASSU also approved student
appointments to several University
committees which have vacancies. They
include:
Doug Carver, Committee on a New
University Dormitory; Dennis Perluss,
General Studies Committee; Kevin
Callaghan, Land and Building
Development Committee; Yale
Braunstein and Fred Oakford, Library
Council.
The evening's only excitement came
as a non-member of the legislature voted
on a minor issue. Braunstein warned the
violator, Young Republicans President
Bill Boyd, that he would forward the
infraction to the Stanford Judicial
Council.
