# Coalition To Reconvene At AEL
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
The April Third Movement meets in
the Applied Electronics Laboratory
(AEL) courtyard at noon today to
discuss the past week's events and
proposals for action. The agenda for the
meeting was suggested at last night's
session of the movement's coordinating
committee.
Doren Weinberg will open discussion
with a summary of the week's events.

He will present the decisions of the
Academic Senate and the resolution
released last night by the Trustees.
Weinberg will speculate on next
Tuesday's Academic Senate meeting and
Wednesday's Trustee hearing.
Next, Mike Weinstein, who chairs
today's meeting, will open the floor to
motions and discussion.
Those present at last night's
coordinating committee meeting divided
into small groups to discuss proposals
that might give direction to today's
discussion. But the late Academic
Senate meeting forced them to
postpone consideration of these
proposals.
Earlier Weinberg had suggested,
"Some will probably push for
immediate action if the results of the
Academic Senate meeting are bad.
Others will want to make demands at
the Tuesday and Wednesday meetings of
the Academic Senate and Trustees." He
added that some people might want to
defer demands and wait until
Wednesday.
Before the meeting broke up, the
committee obtained a copy of W.
Palmer Fuller's announcement of
Wednesday's open hearing.
Disappointment was evident in the
subsequent discussion. Weinberg
remarked, "It is the most outragous
arrogant response to a campus crisis that
I can conceive of."
In other business the committee
debated its representation at Monday's
lunch with Trustee John Gardner. Denis

Hayes had invited Paul Rupert to attend
on what Rupert considered an unofficial
basis. After rejecting the suggestion that
the movement send three official
researchers in addition to Rupert, the
committee asked him not to attend.
A poster campaign was also
organized. The Coalition hopes to
plaster campus buildings with signs that
read, "ANY DAY NOW." The posters
are to underline the possibility of a
future sit-in.
