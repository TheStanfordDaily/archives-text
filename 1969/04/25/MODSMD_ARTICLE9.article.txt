# Dean Pettit's Letter

Following is the text of a letter
from Engineering Dean Joseph
Pett.it to Stanford President
Kenneth Pitzer on April 21, 1969:
I am writing in regard to those
classified government projects in
the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories of the School ot
Engineering which have recently
been the subject of much public
attention and debate. Rather than
living under uncertainty during a
long wait for the Senate to
reconsider its research policy in
detail, I wish to say now that we
will not request any further
extensions of contractual
arrangements supporting this
research, and will negotiate the
earliest feasible termination.
The first and principal reason
in deciding to take this position
derives from the evident loss of
faculty support necessary for the
pursuit of this or any other
activity in a university. For many
years, dating back to 1951 in the
case of some of the work, support
for the research was implicitly
present. Even as recently as 1967,
when controversy first appeared
in the Academic Council, we
invited the community to visit the
Applied Electronics Laboratory;
few deemed it important enough
at that time to do so. In the
recent past, however, especially in
the Senate meeting of April 15, it
has become clear to me that
adequate support is no longer a
reality.
Secondly, the Senate of the
Academic Council is acting under
great pressure to deal with the
issue of few classified contracts. I
fear that in their urge to respond,
they may enact unworkable and
repressive legislation, together
with cumbersome and autocratic
centralized enforcement
procedures. I fear that this is a
threat to our freedom of scholarly
inquiry. With our discontinuance
of these contracts the existing

research policy could perhaps be
saved from hasty revisions and
indiscriminate assault.
Thirdly, I feel that the
Stanford community is in a crisis
of civil government so great that I
should like to help free you and
the Senate to direct your
immediate attention to it. It
seems to me that our present
judicial system operates with
excruciating difficulty, that our
legislation is primitive, and that
we are incapable of enforcing
what little we have. The
community seems unable to
assure an adequate minimum of
protection to faculty offices,
personal files and property, and I
have serious dobts as to the safety
of classified documents.
I implore you and the Senate
to perceive the repeatable scenario
in last week's events:
1) A controversial research
target is selected by an
independent group.
2) An embarrassing sit-in is
staged; a scandal is "revealed."
3) Speakers laud the "issues,"
brush aside the "tactics." Defense
of the faculty involved is
conspicuously missing.
4) Community support swings
for "reform."
5) The attack succeeds.
There are many potential
targets at Stanford; how many
must go down before we learn
how to protect ourselves?
Having set forth the reasons for
my present position, I now wish
to comment on the
"non-reasons." Logic does not
persuade me that research is
always inappropriate to a
university if all aspects are not
open to all members of the
community. I am sure there are
situations in various disciplines
where research data are not open
to public inspection, and where
there is private correspondence
with and reporting to the sponsor.

Such research can be academically
operable and can produce
contributions to knowledge which
can be made public, as it has been
with out classified projects.
I also am not persuaded that it
is a fair test of sponsored research
in a university that it be judged by
possible applications thought by
someone to be "objectionable,"
no matter how much outweighed
by "acceptable" applications. The
only escape from such an
inquisition would be that a
professor work only on those
matters which have no possible
application. In the School of
Engineering it is our function to
produce knowledge which can be
applied to the needs and wants of
people; we must be allowed to do
this. Indeed, I would hope for
wide support from the
community on this concept.
I have not changed my
continuing view that it is moral
for an individual in my faculty, as
his conscience permits, to engage
in research, either classified or
unclassified, which is sponsored
by or might be useful to the
people of this nation in the
common defense. At this moment
especially, I wish to stand with
those of my colleagues who have
personally vilified for working in a
university on electronic warfare; I
have done such work myself. It is
a matter of public record that
several years ago, in the Stanford
offices you now occupy, Dr.
Pitzer, there was presented to me
on behalf of then President
Truman a recognition for
classified research in radar
countermeasures, conducted while
I was on the staff of Harvard
University.
I close with the request that
you join in assisting my colleagues
whose research and livelihood will
be affected by this seemingly
inevitable outcome of our present
crisis.
