Engineering and Science at IBM
"The interdisciplinary
environment keeps you
technologically hot!'
"Working in data processing today pretty much
means you work in a broad spectrum of tech
nologies," says Nick Donofrio.
An Associate Engineer at IBM, Nick is a
1967 graduate in Electrical Engineering.
He's using his technical background
to design circuits for computer
memory systems.
"Circuit design used to be a narrow
job," he says. "Today it can take you
into the front yard of half a dozen
different fields. In my job, for example,
I work with systems design engineers,
chemists, physicists, metallurgists,
and programmers."
Nick describes a hypothetical case
history: "A memory systems man y
comes to me with memory circuit
requirements. Before I can start JF*
designing the circuit, I go to see a
physicist. He helps me select an
appropriate technology for the llill
monolithic circuit.
"As the design develops, I work with a
test group and also check back with the
systems and semiconductor people to make
sure I'm on the right track."
Keeping up
The interdisciplinary environment at IBM helps
you keep up to date technologically. As Nick
puts it, "You're constantly exposed to what's
happening in other fields."
IBM needs technical graduates to work in
research, design and development, manufactur
ing, product test, field engineering, and space
and defense projects. We also need technical
people in programming and marketing.
