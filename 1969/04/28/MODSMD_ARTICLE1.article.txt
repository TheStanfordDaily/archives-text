# Movement Demands Open Meeting; Pitzer Warns Against Interference
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
President Kenneth Pitzer warned the
April 3rd Movement on Friday that he
will cancel the Trustees' hearing on SRI
April 30 unless the Movement promises
that it will not disrupt the "order and
decorum of the meeting."
Pitzer set a 2 p.m. deadline
tomorrow for a satisfactory reply.
In response, the Movement's
Coordinating committee released a
letter last night to Pitzer which
the Movement's demand for an open
meeting of the Board of Trustees April
30, and denied that the Movement had
planned any disruption of the hearing.
(The texts of both letters appear on
this page.)
Hearing Scheduled
The latest cycle of events began
Thursday night, when Pitzer issued a
statement announcing that the
long-delayed hearing would take place
April 30, in an undisclosed location.
Five trustees are to hear testimony from
selected SRI employees and Stanford
students, faculty and staff. The hearing
will be broadcast on KZSU radio.
At a noon meeting Friday in the
AEL courtyard, attended by more than
700 persons, the April 3rd Movement
voted to demand that the closed hearing
be replaced by an open meeting of all
23 Trustees, so that members of the
community could exchange information
with the Board on the SRI issue. The

Movement asked that Pitzer respond to
the demand before Tuesday night, and
scheduled a community meeting at
noon Wednesday in the Old Union
courtyard to consider his response.
Later Friday afternoon, Pitzer issued
his statement to the Movement,
claiming that "The tone and substance
of your meeting this noon suggest that
the hearing may be disrupted unless
your demands are accepted." Pitzer
went on to demand a guarantee that no
disruption would take place.
Friday night, Board president W.
Parmer Fuller 111 said that the
Movement demand was "unacceptable."
Pitzer's Original Position
The Movement's reply to Pitzer,
written Sunday night, states that Pitzer
himself has favored the idea of an open
meeting of the Board in April. "We
hope that you would not precipitously
cancel the hearing," says the Movement,
"but rather that you would address
yourself to the needs and demands of
this community."
The Movement has also circulated a
petition in support of the demand for
an open meeting. As of Sunday night,
more than 1,600 signatures had been
collected. The Movement planned to set
up tables at Tresidder Union and
elsewhere to circulate the petition.
In other developments, the
Movement's coordinating committee
voted last night to invite Trustee John
Gardner to an open forum Tuesday at
noon in White Plaza.
Trustee Recommendations
Gardner, former Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, and currently
head of the Urban Coalition, is
chairman of a Trustee committee to
draw up recommendations for changes
in the composition and duties of the
Board of Trustees. Gardner will be on
campus today and tomorrow to discuss
university governance with various
faculty, student and staff groups.
He had made no arrangements to
speak with members of the April 3rd
Movement.
In other organizing activities, the
Movement will send speakers to most
campus dormitories tonight to discuss

the Trustees' meeting and the SRI
question.
Members of the Movement are also
preparing a detailed letter on SRI to be
sent to members of the Academic
Senate. The Senate will meet tomorrow
afternoon to continue its deliberations
on the SRI Study Committee report.
• Pitser's Letter
Members of the April 3rd Movement:
As the Stanford Daily of Friday,
April 25, reported, I assured the Board
of Trustees that order and decorum
would be maintained at the April 30th
hearing on the relationship between
Stanford and SRI. I also recommended
that the hearing should not be held
unless we were confident that those
conditions would be observed.
The tone and the substance of your
meeting this noon suggest that the
hearing may be disrupted unless your
demands are accepted. I must now insist
that you assure me, not later than 2
p.m. Tuesday, April 29, that you will
refrain from interfering with the order
and decorum of the hearing. Unless I
have your assurance by that hour, I shall
recommend that the hearing be
cancelled.

• Movement's Reply
President Pitzer:
In your letter of April 25th, you
state that you plan to recommend the
calculation of the scheduled Trustees'
hearing of April 30th unless the April
3rd Movement "assures" you by 2 p.m.
Tuesday that it will "refrain from
interfering with the order and decorum
of the hearing."
We received your letter after our
Friday noon rally, at which we
reaffirmed our demand for an open
hearing with all the Trustees on the SRI
question. We restated that demand in
the wake of intense community interest
in such a meeting, stemming from both

the March 11th meeting and subsequent
events.
We wish to remind you of your
promise in Dinkelspiel on April 9th to
work for such a meeting of the Trustees
on this most important issue, and we
note with regret your current silence on
this question.
We have asked for a reply to our
reasonable demands concerning the
hearings by 5 p.m. Tuesday, and have
planned a community meeting for
Wednesday noon to consider your reply.
Apparently, you have assumed that such
requests constitute a threat to "order
and decorum."
Our last community meeting
entertained no motion regarding the
disruption of the Wednesday hearings; it
focused on the nature of those
proceedings—that they be held in a
suitably large auditorium, that they be
open to the community, and that all
Trustees be present.
We ask that you too focus on the
nature of those hearings, and commit
yourself to working toward an open and
decorous hearing which would benefit
us all. We hope that you would not
precipitously cancel the hearing, but
rather that you would address yourself
to the needs and demands of the
community.

Friday night, Board president W.
Parmer Fuller 111 said that the
Movement demand was "unacceptable."
Pitzer's Original Position
The Movement's reply to Pitzer,
written Sunday night, states that Pitzer
himself has favored the idea of an open
meeting of the Board in April. "We
hope that you would not precipitously
cancel the hearing," says the Movement,
"but rather that you would address
yourself to the needs and demands of
this community."
The Movement has also circulated a
petition in support of the demand for
an open meeting. As of Sunday night,
more than 1,600 signatures had been
collected. The Movement planned to set
up tables at Tresidder Union and
elsewhere to circulate the petition.
In other developments, the
Movement's coordinating committee
voted last night to invite Trustee John
Gardner to an open forum Tuesday at
noon in White Plaza.
Trustee Recommendations
Gardner, former Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, and currently
head of the Urban Coalition, is
chairman of a Trustee committee to
draw up recommendations for changes
in the composition and duties of the
Board of Trustees. Gardner will be on
campus today and tomorrow to discuss
university governance with various
faculty, student and staff groups.
He had made no arrangements to
speak with members of the April 3rd

In other organizing activities, the
Movement will send speakers to most
campus dormitories tonight to discuss

the Trustees' meeting and the SRI
question.
Members of the Movement are also
preparing a detailed letter on SRI to be
sent to members of the Academic
Senate. The Senate will meet tomorrow

• Pitser's Letter
Members of the April 3rd Movement:
As the Stanford Daily of Friday,
April 25, reported, I assured the Board
of Trustees that order and decorum
would be maintained at the April 30th
hearing on the relationship between
Stanford and SRI. I also recommended
that the hearing should not be held
unless we were confident that those
conditions would be observed.
The tone and the substance of your
meeting this noon suggest that the
hearing may be disrupted unless your
demands are accepted. I must now insist
that you assure me, not later than 2
p.m. Tuesday, April 29, that you will
refrain from interfering with the order
and decorum of the hearing. Unless I
have your assurance by that hour, I shall
recommend that the hearing be
cancelled.

• Movement's Reply
President Pitzer:
In your letter of April 25th, you
state that you plan to recommend the
calculation of the scheduled Trustees'
hearing of April 30th unless the April
3rd Movement "assures" you by 2 p.m.
Tuesday that it will "refrain from
interfering with the order and decorum
of the hearing."
We received your letter after our
Friday noon rally, at which we
reaffirmed our demand for an open
hearing with all the Trustees on the SRI
question. We restated that demand in
the wake of intense community interest
in such a meeting, stemming from both

the March 11th meeting and subsequent
events.
We wish to remind you of your
promise in Dinkelspiel on April 9th to
work for such a meeting of the Trustees
on this most important issue, and we
note with regret your current silence on
this question.
We have asked for a reply to our
reasonable demands concerning the
hearings by 5 p.m. Tuesday, and have
planned a community meeting for
Wednesday noon to consider your reply.
Apparently, you have assumed that such
requests constitute a threat to "order
and decorum."
Our last community meeting
entertained no motion regarding the
disruption of the Wednesday hearings; it
focused on the nature of those
proceedings—that they be held in a
suitably large auditorium, that they be
open to the community, and that all
Trustees be present.
We ask that you too focus on the
nature of those hearings, and commit
yourself to working toward an open and
decorous hearing which would benefit
us all. We hope that you would not
precipitously cancel the hearing, but
rather that you would address yourself

• Pitser's Letter
Members of the April 3rd Movement:
As the Stanford Daily of Friday,
April 25, reported, I assured the Board
of Trustees that order and decorum
would be maintained at the April 30th
hearing on the relationship between
Stanford and SRI. I also recommended
that the hearing should not be held
unless we were confident that those
conditions would be observed.
The tone and the substance of your
meeting this noon suggest that the
hearing may be disrupted unless your
demands are accepted. I must now insist
that you assure me, not later than 2
p.m. Tuesday, April 29, that you will
refrain from interfering with the order
and decorum of the hearing. Unless I
have your assurance by that hour, I shall
recommend that the hearing be
cancelled.
K. S. Pitzer
• Movement's Reply
President Pitzer:
In your letter of April 25th, you
state that you plan to recommend the
calculation of the scheduled Trustees'
hearing of April 30th unless the April
3rd Movement "assures" you by 2 p.m.
Tuesday that it will "refrain from
interfering with the order and decorum
of the hearing."
We received your letter after our
Friday noon rally, at which we
reaffirmed our demand for an open
hearing with all the Trustees on the SRI
question. We restated that demand in
the wake of intense community interest
in such a meeting, stemming from both

the March 11th meeting and subsequent
events.
We wish to remind you of your
promise in Dinkelspiel on April 9th to
work for such a meeting of the Trustees
on this most important issue, and we
note with regret your current silence on
this question.
We have asked for a reply to our
reasonable demands concerning the
hearings by 5 p.m. Tuesday, and have
planned a community meeting for
Wednesday noon to consider your reply.
Apparently, you have assumed that such
requests constitute a threat to "order
and decorum."
Our last community meeting
entertained no motion regarding the
disruption of the Wednesday hearings; it
focused on the nature of those
proceedings—that they be held in a
suitably large auditorium, that they be
open to the community, and that all
Trustees be present.
We ask that you too focus on the
nature of those hearings, and commit
yourself to working toward an open and
decorous hearing which would benefit
us all. We hope that you would not
precipitously cancel the hearing, but
rather that you would address yourself
to the needs and demands of the
community.

Coordinating Committee


FULL HKARINC-A mass of members of the campus community surround a speaker at
Friday's April 3 Movement rally.
President Kenneth Pitzer warned the
April 3rd Movement on Friday that he
will cancel the Trustees' hearing on SRI
April 30 unless the Movement promises
that it will not disrupt the "order and
decorum of the meeting."
Pitzer set a 2 p.m. deadline
tomorrow for a satisfactory reply.
In response, the Movement's
Coordinating committee released a
letter last night to Pitzer which
the Movement's demand for an open
meeting of the Board of Trustees April
30, and denied that the Movement had
planned any disruption of the hearing.
(The texts of both letters appear on
this page.)
Hearing Scheduled
The latest cycle of events began
Thursday night, when Pitzer issued a
statement announcing that the
long-delayed hearing would take place
April 30, in an undisclosed location.
Five trustees are to hear testimony from
selected SRI employees and Stanford
students, faculty and staff. The hearing
will be broadcast on KZSU radio.
At a noon meeting Friday in the
AEL courtyard, attended by more than
700 persons, the April 3rd Movement
voted to demand that the closed hearing
be replaced by an open meeting of all
23 Trustees, so that members of the
community could exchange information
with the Board on the SRI issue. The

Movement asked that Pitzer respond to
the demand before Tuesday night, and
scheduled a community meeting at
noon Wednesday in the Old Union
courtyard to consider his response.
Later Friday afternoon, Pitzer issued
his statement to the Movement,
claiming that "The tone and substance
of your meeting this noon suggest that
the hearing may be disrupted unless
your demands are accepted." Pitzer
went on to demand a guarantee that no
disruption would take place.
Friday night, Board president W.
Parmer Fuller 111 said that the
Movement demand was "unacceptable."
Pitzer's Original Position
The Movement's reply to Pitzer,
written Sunday night, states that Pitzer
himself has favored the idea of an open
meeting of the Board in April. "We
hope that you would not precipitously
cancel the hearing," says the Movement,
"but rather that you would address
yourself to the needs and demands of
this community."
The Movement has also circulated a
petition in support of the demand for
an open meeting. As of Sunday night,
more than 1,600 signatures had been
collected. The Movement planned to set
up tables at Tresidder Union and
elsewhere to circulate the petition.
In other developments, the
Movement's coordinating committee
voted last night to invite Trustee John
Gardner to an open forum Tuesday at
noon in White Plaza.
Trustee Recommendations
Gardner, former Secretary of Health,
Education and Welfare, and currently
head of the Urban Coalition, is
chairman of a Trustee committee to
draw up recommendations for changes
in the composition and duties of the
Board of Trustees. Gardner will be on
campus today and tomorrow to discuss

faculty, student and staff groups.
