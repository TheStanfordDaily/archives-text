# Letters To The Editor
## Response To The Academic Senate 
### 
Editor, THK DAILY:
I appreciate your printing in
full my letter of April 21 to
President Pitzer. I regret that the
Senate did not turn to the serious
issues I raised, but instead
hastened on with the research
policy legislation.
Inasmuch as my letter of April
21 was written before the Senate
legislation was drafted and passed,
may I now offer some comments
on that legislation? It seems both
good and bad. It is good because
it does not take political positions
or pass moral judgments. It is bad
because it seems to be a mockery
of the principle it espouses,
namely total openness
(non-secrecy) of academic
research.
It is a mockery because it
grants so many exceptions. It
grants special exemption to all the
non-open faculty activities except
those few classified electronics
contracts which caused our recent
campus embarrassment. It is
curious that the existence of some
non-open research is regarded as
not deleterious to the academic
quality of all those departments
which are exempted, while one of
my departments—Electrical
Engineering—is singled out to be
saved from itself.
The paradox is that this
department ranks first in the U.S.
as to the effectiveness of its
graduate program in the recent
Cartter survey of the American
Council on Education.
It is too bad that my letter did
not sufficiently ease the crisis
atmosphere to enable the Senate
to reject the inherent hypocrisy
and discrimination in tbe draft
legislation, and send it back to the
Research Policy Committee with
different and better instructions.

9 An Alternative
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have just come from the
fascinating session on War-Related

Research of the"Day of
Concern," at which Professor
McAfee Brown posed the national
dilemma as the possible need to
choose between being
executioners or victims. He
preferred the latter choice. This
parallels the suggestion by
Professor Bube presented in a
Daily article a week or so ago,
which added that by making the
moral, if seemingly foolish,
choice, the support of the
Almighty could be expected to
provide an alleviating influence.
At the sessions on technology
and human welfare on March 4th,
Professor Lederberg suggested
that the existence of sovereign
nations, each free to build its
military potential and threaten its
neighbors as it saw fit, constituted
the major source of international
conflict.
It seems to me that efforts to
reduce national sovereignty
through multi-lateral disarmament
agreements, leading eventually
towards international rule of law,
even though seemingly not
promising at the present time,
offer a much more desirable
alternative to that of accepting
the role of either an executioner
or a victim.

Surely such attempts, rather
than efforts to limit technological
research in this Country
uni-laterally, would provide an
opportunity to peace groups and
scientists and engineers to join in
common, hopefully constructive
cause. The former to alert
national and world opinion to the
dire need for such political trends,
and the latter to analyze the

technological problems associated
with agreement safeguards, which
played such as important role in
the final success of the Test Ban
Treaty negotiations.
It seems to me that the
dynamic of the community action
at Stanford in recent months has
tended to neglect completely this
possible approach. It was
impressed by the timing of the

lecture on World Government
presented by Professor North at
Tresidder on Sunday, March 9th,
in view of the relevance to the
discussions of the previous week,
as cited above, but I was
depressed to find only about a
dozen people in the audience,
including perhaps three students.
