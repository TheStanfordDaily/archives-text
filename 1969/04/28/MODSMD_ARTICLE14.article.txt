# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## A 						New Human Community 
### Daniel C. Snell 
There has been rhetoric
flowing from certain pens that the
April Third Coalition—now called
a Movement—may be made up of
sensitive people who are seeking
not just an end to vicious research
within the University and at
Stanford Research Institute but
also a new human community.
The political theorists are
there, to be sure, and the Free
University people who are
reportedly given to touching each
other's faces.
But the campaign against
war-related research has not really
begun to form a new mentality, a
new openness and understanding
between people. It has not
generated the demise of a
leadership structure, though those
who are in the leadership
structure of the Movement deny
interest in cults of personality.
To speak with candor, one
must say that passions still tear
those who sat Jt. who may sit in,
again. To speak with candor, one
must admit that they still
remember the solipsistic joy of
what has been euphemistically
termed "achievement."
And they are not changed.
Harris In Uniform
Some time ago a man from the
professional press who had met
with David Harris commented
that he could well have been a
noble platoon leader in another
war brought on by different tides
of time.
But in these times Mr. Harris is

going to jail, his wife a memory
infrequently renewed.
But I think it is important to
ask oneself what one is doing now
that will reach out and touch
people. If you do not want
physically to touch faces, at least
many Stanford students do think
they wish to touch hearts, to
move toward a world in which
one can look into another's eyes
on the street without feeling
ashamed.
Distant Passion
It is certain that there are as
many different ways of bringing
about such a world as there are
people who wish it to come. And
it is frequently difficult to feel
immense passion about the
treatment of a distant people so
long ravaged by wars that they
have forgotten the name of peace.
But the issue is very real, not
made less so by the electronic
televisionary devices that make us
aware of it. Not made less so by
the calmness of a University of
high degree.
And in making the Trustees see
the political and moral nature of
their every decision in these
questions can be found, I think,
the roots of a better world, the
beginnings, however fragile, of
honest relation.
Wishing Indirectly
We cannot let them say they
wish indirectly to kill a
Vietnamese while they continue
to assert that they are trying to
run a University dedicated to
preserving human life and human
knowledge. They cannot be

allowed to continue living that
kind of vicious contradiction.
And if the students here are
content to let this week and
others pass without examining the
issue of SRI and war research, I
question when in fact they will
begin to exercise the consciences
that stopped Johnson from
seeking another term and that
make this dirty little war the most
hated in history.
The question of tactics, so
much debated while the recent
sit-in ran its course, is entirely \
secondary. Tactics proceed from
what you is right, and I
when the evil is as great as it is !
here and now, one has got to be
ready to commit more than his
mark on a ballot to what he
believes.
The April Third people may
not be living a completely new
style of life. But who else at
Stanford has thought to ask the
questions that lead to trying to
live that life?
The members of the Movement
are not your saints or your
sinners. They are not your hippies
or your academicians. Perhaps
they are your singers of a new
song of life; they cannot always
agree on he words. And the music
is sometimes dissonant.
But the message, it is very
clear: leave off fear and act now
to effect the human social change
we all aver we want.
