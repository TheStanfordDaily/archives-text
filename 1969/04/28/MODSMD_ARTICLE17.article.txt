## Trustee Moral Re-Education 
### John D. Black 
The April 3d Movement may,
at its best, be viewed as a crash
program in moral re-education; it
constitutes an effort to persuade
the community, particularly the
faculty and trustees, that certain
vital moral principles are being
violated in the University, at SRI,
and elsewhere.
If we agree that one does not
win men's minds by force, then to
the extent that coercion is
involved, the goal of moral
re-education will be lost. No
doubt some such dramatic tactic
as the AEL sit-in was necessary to
focus the attention of the
community on the issues. In this
sense, the sit-in was a spectacular
success.
The questions which the
Movement must now ask are how
is moral re-education
accomplished: How are men led
to relinquish an idea, conviction,
or value which they may have
held for many years and to
substitute for it a new perception:
Take the problem confronting a
researcher whose entire career has
been devoted to research, much of
which has proved useful to the
Department of Defense. He has
been honored over the years for
his contributions to America and
the free world. Now, perhaps
approaching less productive years,
he is told that what he is doing is
immoral. Does this mean that his
whole life has been dedicated to

immoral purposes? Is he an evil
man?
Since his dilemma is similar to
some we meet in doing
psychotherapy, where people
must often be helped to face
aspects of themselves which they
find deeply disturbing, it is
possible that some of the lessons
from such counseling might be
useful in a program of moral
re-education.
Establish Rapport
One of our initial techniques
for helping a person change his
perceptions is to establish rapport
with him and to build a
relationship of mutual trust, one
in which his self-esteem is
strengthened by our interest in
and concern for him and our
continued efforts in his behalf.
The essential goal of the process is
the reduction of his defensiveness
in the face of the personally
threatening questions he must
face.
If we now apply this paradigm
to the task of inducing Stanford
trustees to view many activities
that Stanford and SRI have been
commended for in the past as
presently unacceptable, several
obvious conclusions emerge:
It will not reduce their
defensiveness to have a public trial
in Mem Aud at which we all
scream "Fascists! Pigs!

Murderers!" at the assembled
trustees. The whole setting is, for
most of them, strange and
anxiety-provoking, and the
audience behavior is unlikely to
allay any anxieties.
Such meetings are usually
advocated on what I suspect is a
false premise; namely, that the
trustees can be coerced on these
issues. The personality
characteristics that most trustees
possess, their vocational histories
and present positions do not make
them easy to intimidate with the
weapons available to students.
They should be viewed very
differently in this respect from
college faculty and administrators
who must live and work on the
campus, who know, like, and
respect students generally, and
who have a very personal stake in
maintaining a constructive and
congenial atmosphere on campus.
No Impact
Whether Stanford were shut
down for a quarter or became a
garrison for federal troops would
have almost no impact on the life
of any trustee, and in terms of his
belief system, he might under
certain conditions consider these
eventualities quite appropriate.
What we need is to decide in
what setting each trustee would
be most comfortable, least
defensive, most open to new
ideas. Perhaps in his own home,

with a peer or two, a couple of
faculty or administrators, and two
or three students. Perhaps at a
week-end retreat, with the
participants dividing into small
colloquia. Perhaps in a professor's
home for a free-wheeling
discussion. The format may vary,
but I am optimistic that individual
trustees would be responsive to
well-conceived invitations.
Such an approach may
frustrate a few who want to shout
obscenities or view a public
blood-letting, but I submit that
you don't insinuate new ideas into
men's minds with a sledge
hammer. Even if coercion could
be effective, it would be a
short-sighted tactic, for it would
do nothing to increase the moral
sensitivities of the trustees or of
others in the university
community. There are and will be
many other issues at Stanford
which have significant moral
implications and which a sensitive
Board would handle with greater
wisdom. As the Coalition has
pointed out, our trustees also have
influence on other boards whose
actions affect many lives.
Frightening Leap
What students naturally have
difficulty appreciating is that they
are really attempting to extend
moral principles far beyond the
vision of any except a few
prophets. For most members of
an older generation, this extension
requires a giant and often
frightening leap.
Take, for example, the
question of ROTC. When my own
generation was in college, the only
serious question even debated
about ROTC was whether it
should be compulsory for all male
students, as it was then in most
land grant colleges. That it didn't
belong on campus or didn't
deserve academic credit never
occurred to any of us.
Several years ago, at the time
of Stanford's first sit-in, I was
called "morally insensitive"
because I defended the
administration on campus of an
aptitude test that enabled most
Stanford students to obtain
deferments in the days before
there were blanket student
deferments. I felt cruelly
attacked, but now I would say the
charge was justified. I have
changedâ€”but unlike the trustees, I
have had the advantage of daily
contacts with bright and
concerned students and the
stimulation to learn which a
university environment provides.
1 would suggest that if the
Movement really desires to
heighten the trustees' moral
sensitivites, it should approach the
task with much the same attitude
the counselor takes with his
client, or, to take another
example, with the same respect
and honesty and consideration
most students would use to help
their parents understand why they
were sitting in at AEL.
