# Setting The Record Straight
## Another 'Liberal' Project 
### Leonard Siegal 
Saturday I read the following
quote in the Palo Alto Times from
radioscience professor O. G.
Villard Jr., son of the famous
pacifist editor of the Nation.
Villard, who runs a $1 million
classified contract, said:
"As the son of a liberal who
was a devoted pacifist and
founder of the NAACP, I have
searched my conscience from the
beginning of this work and have
always felt I have been completely
faithful to the pacifist traditions
of my family. The research I have
been engaged in was 100 percent
directed toward the saving of
human lives."
The project to which Villard
refers is over-the-horizon radar,
which I understand to be integral
to the development of an
anti-ballistic missile system.
According to a letter which
Villard sent to then President of
the University J. E. Wallace
Sterling on September 21, 1964,
Stanford pioneered in this kind of
radar, beginning in 1957. The
project, which by now must have
added up to more than $10
million, not only covers important
"defense" research but, according
to Villard's letter, is "in the spirit
and tradition of the University.
The scientific work has virtually
all been carried out bv students."

In other words, unlike Prof.
William Rambo's programs,
Villard's project trains a large
number of students to continue
this type of work.
Rather than continue to pick
1 at various statements in this letter,
I quote here the last two
paragraphs:
"According to an opinion
currently held in the Defense
Department," wrote Villard,
"U.S. Universities are not
contributing as much as they
should to defense technology,
because professors tend to confine
their efforts to publishing papers
in fascinating but inconsequential
aspects of important problems. In
view of the record of SEL
(Stanford Electronics
Laboratories) in many areas, it is
doubtful that this charge can be
levelled against Stanford.
"The fact of Stanford's
participation in the radar program
was revealed in a 1959 newspaper
release on this subject...
However the extent of the
participation, as outlined in this
letter, is not generally known. We
doubt if any useful purpose would
be served by further publicity at
this time, as it would invite
unwelcome attention. However it
is certainly reasonable that
responsible members of the

Stanford Family should be aware
of what has happened."
Now let us look at what Villard
told the Palo Alto Times
Saturday. His emotional remarks
came in response to the Academic
Senate's prohibition of classified
research. Villard said, "the
overriding importance of my
research problem causes me to
reserve judgment as to whether I
should remain at the University or
continue this work elsewhere."
It is unfortunate that a sincere
and devoted faculty member like
Villard should be inconvenienced
by the Senate's decision that
secret research is not a function of
Stanford University. But Villard's
misfortune is educational because
it reveals these facts:
1. Stanford has been busily at
wirk on the technology of the
ABM system;
2. Our new ban on secret
research seems to be hitting at the
war complex where it
hurts—technology for grandiose
new weapons systems;
3. Tiie research teams that
innocently do this work are all set
to move elsewhere like to SRI,
for instance.

"As the son of a liberal who
was a devoted pacifist and
founder of the NAACP, I have
searched my conscience from the
beginning of this work and have
always felt I have been completely
faithful to the pacifist traditions
of my family. The research I have
been engaged in was 100 percent
directed toward the saving of
human lives."
The project to which Villard
refers is over-the-horizon radar,
which I understand to be integral
to the development of an
anti-ballistic missile system.
According to a letter which
Villard sent to then President of
the University J. E. Wallace
Sterling on September 21, 1964,
Stanford pioneered in this kind of
radar, beginning in 1957. The
project, which by now must have
added up to more than $10
million, not only covers important
"defense" research but, according
to Villard's letter, is "in the spirit
and tradition of the University.
The scientific work has virtually
all been carried out bv students."

In other words, unlike Prof.
William Rambo's programs,
Villard's project trains a large
number of students to continue
this type of work.
Rather than continue to pick
1 at various statements in this letter,
I quote here the last two
paragraphs:
"According to an opinion
currently held in the Defense
Department," wrote Villard,
"U.S. Universities are not
contributing as much as they
should to defense technology,
because professors tend to confine
their efforts to publishing papers
in fascinating but inconsequential
aspects of important problems. In
view of the record of SEL
(Stanford Electronics
Laboratories) in many areas, it is
doubtful that this charge can be
levelled against Stanford.
"The fact of Stanford's
participation in the radar program
was revealed in a 1959 newspaper
release on this subject...
However the extent of the
participation, as outlined in this
letter, is not generally known. We
doubt if any useful purpose would
be served by further publicity at
this time, as it would invite
unwelcome attention. However it
is certainly reasonable that
responsible members of the

Stanford Family should be aware
of what has happened."
Now let us look at what Villard
told the Palo Alto Times
Saturday. His emotional remarks
came in response to the Academic
Senate's prohibition of classified
research. Villard said, "the
overriding importance of my
research problem causes me to
reserve judgment as to whether I
should remain at the University or
continue this work elsewhere."
It is unfortunate that a sincere
and devoted faculty member like
Villard should be inconvenienced
by the Senate's decision that
secret research is not a function of
Stanford University. But Villard's
misfortune is educational because
it reveals these facts:
1. Stanford has been busily at
wirk on the technology of the
ABM system;
2. Our new ban on secret
research seems to be hitting at the
war complex where it
hurts—technology for grandiose
new weapons systems;
3. Tiie research teams that
innocently do this work are all set
to move elsewhere like to SRI,
for instance.

the April 3rd Movement.)
Saturday I read the following
quote in the Palo Alto Times from
radioscience professor O. G.
Villard Jr., son of the famous
pacifist editor of the Nation.
Villard, who runs a $1 million
classified contract, said:
"As the son of a liberal who
