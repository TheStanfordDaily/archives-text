# Stanford Nine Drops Pair, Four-Way Tie
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
After defeating the
number-one ranked USC Trojans
in a 3-2 thriller on Friday,
Stanford should have had little
trouble winning at least one game
of Saturday s doubleheader
against UCLA, right?
Wrong.
The Tribe started play
Saturday in sole possession of the
Pac-8 baseball lead, with an 8-2
record. But the solitude proved
too much for Coach Ray Young's
nine, and when the day was over
the Indians were sharing the top
spot with each of the three other
California teams.
Stanford dropped both ends of
that UCLA twin bill, losing the
first game 5-0 and the second 4-3
on a ninth inning homer. The

losses, coupled with the win over
USC, gave the Indians a won-lost
mark of 8 and 4.
The hero of Friday's game was
Stanford pitcher and co-captain
Bob Boone. Not only did Boone
limit the Trojans to four hits, but
he won the game with a two run
homer in the eighth inning. It was
a screaming line drive that cleared
the fence 335 feet down the left
field line. The two runs brought
the Tribe back from a 2-1 deficit
to a 3-2 lead.
Stanford had fallen behind
when USC scored a run in he
second, but the Indians got to SC
starter Jim Barr for a single tally
in the third. Trojan second

baseman Frank Alfano powered a
homer out of the park in the
fourth to give SC the lead again
and the score stayed that way
until Boone's blast. Boone ended
the game by striking out Alfano
with the tying run on third in the
ninth for his sixth win.
There was another crowd of
more than '2,000 in Sunken
Diamond for the UCLA game, but
the fans had a lot less to yell
about. The Tribe was outclassed
on the mound and at the plate
and lost the game when the Bruins
got to starter Phil Keller for four
runs in the sixth. Stanford got j
only four singles off winner Rick
Pope.

Shaky pitching and fielding led
to the Tribe's downfall in the
second game. Starter Rod Poteete,
hurt by three unearned runs, was
removed for a pinch-hitter in the
fifth. Stanford came back with a
solo homer by Mike Ewing in the
fifth, and a two run shot by
Boone in the sixth, but Bruin first
baseman Chris Chambliss homered
to right off reliever Steve Dunning
in the ninth to win the game.


ONE STEP AWAY—That was the story for the Stanford baseball team Saturday as they went into the UCLA doubleheader
all alone in first place, and came out in a four way tie for the lead. The Bruins swept the twin hill, 5-0, and 4-3. UCLA, Cal,
USC, and Stanford all own 8-4 league records. The Indians have nine Pac-8 games remaining—three with Cal, and six with
the easier Northwest schools.

ONE STEP AWAY—That was the story for the Stanford baseball team Saturday as they went into the UCLA doubleheader
all alone in first place, and came out in a four way tie for the lead. The Bruins swept the twin hill, 5-0, and 4-3. UCLA, Cal,
USC, and Stanford all own 8-4 league records. The Indians have nine Pac-8 games remaining—three with Cal, and six with
the easier Northwest schools.
After defeating the
number-one ranked USC Trojans
in a 3-2 thriller on Friday,
Stanford should have had little
trouble winning at least one game
of Saturday s doubleheader
against UCLA, right?
Wrong.
The Tribe started play
Saturday in sole possession of the
Pac-8 baseball lead, with an 8-2
record. But the solitude proved
too much for Coach Ray Young's
nine, and when the day was over
the Indians were sharing the top
spot with each of the three other
California teams.
Stanford dropped both ends of
that UCLA twin bill, losing the
first game 5-0 and the second 4-3
on a ninth inning homer. The

losses, coupled with the win over
USC, gave the Indians a won-lost
mark of 8 and 4.
The hero of Friday's game was
Stanford pitcher and co-captain
Bob Boone. Not only did Boone
limit the Trojans to four hits, but
he won the game with a two run
homer in the eighth inning. It was
a screaming line drive that cleared
the fence 335 feet down the left
field line. The two runs brought
the Tribe back from a 2-1 deficit
to a 3-2 lead.
Stanford had fallen behind
when USC scored a run in he
second, but the Indians got to SC
starter Jim Barr for a single tally
in the third. Trojan second

baseman Frank Alfano powered a
homer out of the park in the
fourth to give SC the lead again
and the score stayed that way
until Boone's blast. Boone ended
the game by striking out Alfano
with the tying run on third in the
ninth for his sixth win.
There was another crowd of
more than '2,000 in Sunken
Diamond for the UCLA game, but
the fans had a lot less to yell
about. The Tribe was outclassed
on the mound and at the plate
and lost the game when the Bruins
got to starter Phil Keller for four
runs in the sixth. Stanford got j
only four singles off winner Rick
Pope.

Shaky pitching and fielding led
to the Tribe's downfall in the
second game. Starter Rod Poteete,
hurt by three unearned runs, was
removed for a pinch-hitter in the
fifth. Stanford came back with a
solo homer by Mike Ewing in the
fifth, and a two run shot by
Boone in the sixth, but Bruin first
baseman Chris Chambliss homered
to right off reliever Steve Dunning
in the ninth to win the game.
