# 'No' Vote Of Confidence
## De Gaulle Leaves Office 
### 
PARIS (AP)—Shunned by his
nation's voters, French President
Charles De Gaulle last night resigned his
office after eleven years as France's
Chief of State.
De Gaulle came out on the short end
of a referendum he proposed that would
have streamlined the French
government. He made the referendum a
matter of great importance, saying that
he would resign if French voters did not
approve his proposed changes.
De Gaulle announced: "I am ceasing
the exercise of my functions as
president of the republic. This decision
takes effect at noon today."
This brief communique was released
in the capital. De Gaulle was at his
country retreat at Colombey-les-Deux-
Eglises.
Decade Rule
De Gaulle, 78, iron-willed ruler of
France for more than a decade, had
vowed he would resign "immediately" if
voters rejected a reform bill on
administration and the Senate.
He made the vote a question of
confidence, against the advice of some
of his most trusted ministers who felt
the general had chosen bad terrain to
fight what may prove to be his last
battle.
In balloting Sunday, the French said
"no" to him. It was a narrow loss, but a
loss all the same.
Complete Figures
Complete Interior Ministry figures
for metropolitan France gave this
breakdown:
Against - 1 1,966,5 50 —52.87 per
cent.
For —10,*>69,550—47.13 per cent.
These r'ld not include returns from
the usually heavily pro-Gauliist overseas
territories which have more than
500,000 votes.
In the years since he took office in
1958, De Gaulle piloted the nation
through upheavals of a general's revolt
in Algeria to a students' rebellion at
home. He pulled France out of the
North Atlantic alliance's military
organization, setting what many
regarded as an anti-American course in
foreign policy. He also unyieldingly
blocked Britain's entry into the
Common Market.

With De Gaulle gone, speculation
turned on former Premier Georges
Pompidou as a likely presidential
successor. De Gaulle dropped Pompidou
from office last year and the men had
been carrying a masked rivalry.
The first to announce De Gaulle's
defeat was Premier Maurice Couve de
Murville. Shortly before midnight
Sunday, he declared: "The French
people, in a majority, has pronounced
itself against the reforms which were
proposed, with all the consequences
that brings."
"Beginning tomorrow, a new page in
our history will be turned," he added.
Couve de Murville forecast "a
difficult period, perhaps a period of
trouble."
Police Alert
Even as he spoke, vans of gendarmes
and riot police took up positions in the
Latin Quarter, the theater last spring of
a student revolution which failed in its
purpose, but brought in its train a labor
upheaval which historians may say
mortally weakened De Gaulle's regime.
Waldeck Rochet, secretary general of
the large and disciplined French
Communist party, said the vote
represented a rejection of "all
reactionary powers" even "under
different colors."
The financial community buzzed
with speculation about what effect De
Gaulle's departure would have on the

French franc. Some foreign exchange
operators said that without De Gaulle
there would likely be less opposition
from the government to devalue
currency in the event of a new
monetary crisis.
A mood of expectant change was felt
also in Brussels, headquarters both of
the North Atlantic Treaty Organization
and the Common Market. Diplomatic
observers there took the view that
France would move to improve relations
with the two big European alliances.
Constitutionally, the next step in
France is for Alain Poher, Senate
president, until recently, an unknown,
to assume an interim presidency and
organize new elections within 20 to 35
days.
Some attribute to Poher, a
60-year-old Centrist, ambitions to make
a run for the Elysee Palace vacated by
De Gaulle.
But the more serious contender is
Pompidou, De Gaulle's premier for
more than six years and architect of last
June's Gaullist parliamentary election
triumph which salvaged the regime's
appearances after the spring student
riots and strikes.
Pompidou's presence as a possible
successor may have contributed to the
rejection of the referendum, especially
by propertied voters, discontented with
De Gaulle's economic program.
