# Runners Drubbed, 93-61
## Oregon Sprints Past Tribe 
### 
At the conclusion of
Saturday's track meet in Eugene
the head starter sought out
Pay ton Jordan to congratulate
him for the fine effort his runners
had put forth in their battle with
Oregon. But once again the Tribe
lacked the depth to sustain their
early momentun. As a result, the
green and yellow clad Webfoots
captured 31 of the last 32 points
after Stanford had closed to
within two points. The final was
Oregon 93, Stanford 61.
Even so, the Indians showed
they have the makings of a fine
squad for the Big Meet next
Saturday and the Pac-8 meet three
weeks hence. Against the heralded
Duch distance strength of Oregon
the Cards split as Brook Thomas

remained undefeated in the
steeplechase, and Pete Fairchild
reversed his front running strategy
with a come from behind victory
in the 880.
And even in the mile where
Web foot Tom Morrow took
honors, Allen Sanford equaled his
lifetime best with a 4.04.6 second
place performance.
But the most exciting events of
the day took place on the infield.
Only minutes before the first
running event and on his last
throw, newly eligible giant T.C.
Jones heaved the shot a winning
57-9.
Caught up in the excitement of
the moment Tom Massey
loosened up by bodily lifting the
massive Jones off the ground and

then proceeded to the triple jump
pit where he leaped to a life time
best of 51-1%.
But the finale was staged in the
javelin where Tom Colby trailed
Oregon's Gordon Clay by one
foot. Colby's final toss never hit
the ground. It reached the
completion of its journey 253-B'/2
away from the toe mark: easily a
plus 263 effort.
Meanwhile, on the track lean,
Rich Faris staged a thrilling
stretch drive with the Duck's Rick
Howard to bring the sprint relay
team home first in 41.4.
But here the Webfoots
gathered themselves and reversed
the tide starting with Gary
Knoke's lunging victory over
ailing Rick Tipton in the highs
and finishing with Jim Reverman
just holding off suprising Bob
Anchondo in the mile relay.
In between, the Tribe
countered with a sweep in the
high jump and Fairchild's
intelligently run 880 in an
attempt to break the trend, but it
wasn't enough.
Now the dual meet season
reaches its climax when Cal arrives
at the Stadium next Saturday
with the Indians going all-out to
break a two year losing streak.


HEADED FOR HOME-With 500
meters left to go, the Stanford varsity
eight drives towards a 23-seeond win
over the St. Mary's Gaels. The race was
held at the University of California's
home course on the Oakland Estuary
in choppy water. The varsity's win
completed a three-race sweep for the
Indian rowers, as the JV's and
freshmen had earlier won their races by
17 and 34 seconds respectively. In
another race, the second frosh whipped
the Santa Clara frosh at Santa Clara by
three lengths.
