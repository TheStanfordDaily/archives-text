# USC Wins Golf Title
## 
### FRED MANN 
The U.S. Collegiate Invitational
Golf Championships are two years
old. Last year it was Stanford the
big winner. This time around,
Stanford was the host attempting
to retain their prize at the expense
of its guests. They did not make
it.
As in all other sports, it was
the University of Southern
California that spoiled the
Stanford fun, as the Trojans
captured both the team and
individual championships in the
event that they did not even enter
last year.
Defending champ, Indian
Sandy Adelman was nowhere to
be seen at the finish. Instead it
was Greg Pitzer of the Tribe
battling the Torjan's Gary Sanders
for the top marks. Sanders fired a
closing round 71 while Pitzer
limped in with a four over-par 75,
and the individual title went to
Los Angeles. Winner Sanders
ended with a 73,75,71—219
against Pitzer's 73,73,75 —221.
Number one Stanford man,
sophomore Tom Watson held the
36 hole lead, but blew sky high on
Saturday with an 81. Watson
finished fifth at 224 behind
Forrest Fezler of San Jose City
College and Greg McHatton of
USC, both with 223.
In the team scoring, Southern
Cal carded a 896 for the 54 holes
while Coach Bud Finger's Indians
followed in 902. San Jose State
finished a distant third with 933,
followed by Seattle University
(937), Oregon (949), and Santa
Clara (952). The Stanford Frosh
finished last in 959.
In team scoring, the top four
scores from each school are
counted.
It was a tough loss for both
Watson and Pitzer. The only other
Card golfer to finish in the top ten
was junior Jeff Blankenberg who
fired rounds of 77-75-76 for 228.
The next outing for the
Stanford golfers will be Friday
when they take on the San Jose
State Spartans at 1:00 p.m. on the
rough Stanford course. Saturday
they match skills with UCLA.
