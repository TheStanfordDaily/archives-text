## 
### 
As an additional service in this
time of great campus concern,
KZSU will include a special t "crisis
reports" in its evening news
coverage at 10:00 p.m. Prepared
from the latest Stanford news
service releases, taped interviews
with the leaders of the April 3
movement, and administration
officials, the KZSU news
department will attempt to place
the many events in perspective.
With reporters in touch with the
actions of the Academic Council,
the Academic Senate, and their

various committees, the 5-10
minute features will include all
important events and comments
on issues occuring up until air
time at 10 p.m.
Because of the great response
to the recent live coverage of the
AEL sit-in, these special "ciisis
reports" have been initiated.
Throughout the boardcast day,
KZSU will also be standing by for
live reports from its remote unit
when news breaks. KZSU
broadcasts at 90.1 FM, 880 AM
(in dorms).
