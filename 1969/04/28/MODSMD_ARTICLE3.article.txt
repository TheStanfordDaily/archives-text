# International Assoc. Sets Spring Election
## 
### 
Nominations for president, two
vice-presidents, and 10 Policy Board
members of the International
Association (IA) will open today.
Nominees must turn in a nomination
signed by two other Association
members between now and Friday
afternoon to the desk at the I-Center.
The nominees must be International
Association members and must have
their nominations signed by two other
IA members. The nominee's name,
major, class, country of origin, and a
statement of intent less than 50 words
long must appear on the nomination.
They will be posted at the I-Center.
One-half of the Policy Board, which
decide IA activities, is elected in the
spring, the other half in the fall. There
are currently six openings for American
students and four for foreign students.
Voting will take place on Tuesday,
May 6, at the I-Center and on
Engineering Corner. A referendum will

also appear on the ballot asking "should
the IA issue political statements?" The
second asks, "should a majority or
two-thirds of the Policy Board decide
on statements?"
The IA is a one-year old ASSU
organization made up of the former
International Club and the Institute of
International Relations (IIR). The
IClub was mainly social and the lIR
was mainly political and educational.
The IA serves both functions now.
The IA offers programs featuring
different countries. The Evenings
Abroad provide an introduction into the
culture of another nationality with
dinner, music and dancing.
Speakers such as Klaus Meschkat and
Karl Dietrich Wolf (East German SDS
leaders) and Belleunde (former
President of Peru) are sponsored by the
IA although they are often held in the
ICenter.
