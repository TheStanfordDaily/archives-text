# Research Committee Head
## Prof Finds Moral Role Immoral 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
"1 will not be the moral policeman
for this university," declares law
professor William F. Baxter, chairman
of Stanford's controversial Committee
on Research Policy. "It is absolutely
immoral to pass a collective judgment,
forbidding an individual investigator to
pursue research."
At 39, Baxter, tall, lean, and
energetic, is recognized as one of
Stanford's most brilliant legal scholars.
His colleagues describe him as
"unusually able, original, analytical,
imaginative, and persuasive."

When asked to use three adjectives
which best describe himself, he replied,
"I'm the kind of person who would not
think up three adjectives to describe
myself."
A Stanford graduate, Phi Beta
Kappa, Baxter most recently served as
director of the Federal Aviation
Agency's study on the legal aspects of
aircraft noise and sonic booms. He
teaches advanced courses in the Law
School, and last year chaired the
Faculty Presidential Selection
Committee.
Despite the respect in which his
university peers hold him, Baxter, in
recent months, has been attacked from
all sides. The Baxter Committee has
been severely criticized in personal
position papers written by individual
AEL research associates. One member
of the committee has also resigned. And
in addition the April 3rd Movement
issued a report entitled "The Goods on
AEL" in which they soundly chastized
the Baxter Committee for alleged
distortions of numerous contract titles.
What are the so-called "Goods" on
the Baxter Committee?
The committee was formed in June
of 1966, in response to the demands of
a concerned faculty group. This group,
led by Bruce Franklin, F. E. Yates, and
H. P. Noyes, suggested that the
university terminate all classified
research. The Academic Council
selected 13 members to study the
question of research activity on
Stanford's campus. Yates and Noyes
were too such members. They were also
included in the group's subcommittee,
which performed most of the inquiries.
(Three students joined the committee in
February of this year.)
In September of 1967 the Baxter
Committee presented its findings and
recommendations on classified research

to the Academic Senate. These were
approved by the Senate and
subsequently have been explained in
detail in the Campus Report, "Research
At Stanford." This report was reprinted
in The Daily.
In addition to the paper, the
Research Committee issued three other
related documents to the community in
November of last year. These were: (1)
A report containing summary
information on the approximately
1,600 research projects operative during
1967-68, (2) An "Annual Financial
Report," and (3) a descriptive list of
classified research projects.
It is the accuracy of "the descriptive
list" compiled by the Baxter Committee
which has become a subject of
contention. A portion of the Stanford
community believes that Baxter who
wrote the descriptions, systematically
distorted the nature of the classified
contracts. To date, no one has presented
any evidence that this is true.
Baxter, working from the notes of
the principle investigators, drew up
descriptions of the contracts. These
contracts are referred to only by
number by everyone except the security
officer who classifies them. The officer,
on the basis of his own interpretation,
assigns the contract a title. These
assigned titles were those which did nto
match the Baxter Committee readings.
This descrepancy surprised neither
Baxter nor the committee, which saw
and approved all of the headings before
they were published. What did surprise
them was "the fluke" by which two of
their own titles mirrored the original
ones assigned by security officer.
Critics believe that the only valid
charge which can be leveled at the
published descriptions of the contracts

is that they are ambiguous. H. P. Noyes
maintains that th"> credibility of the
Baxter Committee can not be
questioned on the grounds of its
sincerity and integrity. It may be
criticized for failing to inform the
community effectively about its work.
The latest proposal which the Baxter
Committee submitted to the Academic
Senate on Thursday differs from the
original. Whereas the first proposal
(Sept. 1967) permitted but discouraged
classified research, the newest (April 24,
1969) recommends that the university
accept no classified research on its
campus with one exception. That
exception is that security clearances for
some members of a research project are
permitted as long as the classified
information involved is "peripheral" to
the research.
Classified research is defined as a
project which requires security
clearance from the federal government
for at least one researcher. The Senate
passed this proposal.
This newest Baxter proposal may be
seen as a continuum of the trend to
tighten the university's control on
research, but it also attempts to
delineate a balanced position between
the freedom of access to information
and the freedom to publish resultant
findings.
The balance posture is a precarious
one. It shifts with time. In 1967
classified research was regarded by the
general university community as
permissable. Today it is regarded as
objectionable.
Whatever the judgment, the Baxter
Committee proposal is formulated "to
get the university community where it
wants to go .. . personally," Baxter
adds, "I don't think it's quite as
optimum as the position that we took in
September 1967, but it's sound."
