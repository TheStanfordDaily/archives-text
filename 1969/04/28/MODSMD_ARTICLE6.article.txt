Michael Kuhl was elected President
of the California College Republicans
yesterday at their Convention in San
Diego.
Kuhl, Associate Editor of The Daily
and past President of the Stanford Area
Young Republicans, defeated Merritt
Hemenway of California State College
at Los Angeles and Mike Sholer of the
University of California at Irvine.
Delegates from over a hundred
Young Republicans chapters at different
colleges and universities in California
attended the Convention, which was

held at the Hilton Inn in San Diego this
past week-end.
The Convention saw the merger of
two campus organizations—the
California Young Republican College
Federation (CYRCF) and the California
College Republicans (CCR). The new
organization adopted the name of the
California College Republicans.
United Support
Peter Chase, outgoing President of
CYRCF, said of Kuhl; "He'll have the
united support of the new
organization."
Hemenway led the race through the
first ballot. Sholer, was was trailing,
then withdrew and threw his support to
Kuhl, giving him a margin of 168-132
over Hemenway at the close of voting.
Many attributed Kuhl's election to
his reputation as a campus activist at
Stanford and his experience in the
Young Republicans. He is a junior in
economics and sociology, Associate
Editor of The Daily, a member of the
Student Education Council, and
Chairman of the San Mateo County
Young Republicans.
Political Experience
Last year Michael Kuhl was the
director of the Young Republicans
chapters in Area XI, which extends over
four counties. He was President of the
Stanford Area Young Republicans last
fall.
Hemenway, the outgoing Executive
Vice-President of CYRCF said, "I hope
Michael doesn't have too many
commitments already. It's a full-time
job. To get everyone behind him, he'll
have to perform."
Bill Boyd, President of the Stanford
YRs and campaign manager for Kuhl at
the Convention, was optomistic: "When
Michael was president of the Stanford
chapter, he greatly helped to enhance
the credibility of the YRs in the
community at large. I am sure he will be
able to do the same thing on a
state-wide level."
State-Wide Move
In a letter circulated among the
delegates, Kuhl wrote, "The time is
right to establish a state-wide college
political organization through which to
challenge the positions of the radical
left and mobilize a 'constructive
majority.' " Throughout the campaign,
Kuhl urged the state organization to
"involve its members in student
government and the process of
educational reform on the various
campuses."
The Stanford Area Young
Republicans, the largest YR chapter
west of the Mississippi, sent 28 delegates
to the Convention and was the largest
delegation. Roman Buhler, programs
vice-president of the Stanford YRs, was
unanimously elected director of Area
XI.

right to establish a state-wide college
political organization through which to
challenge the positions of the radical
left and mobilize a 'constructive
majority.' " Throughout the campaign,
Kuhl urged the state organization to
"involve its members in student
government and the process of
educational reform on the various
campuses."
The Stanford Area Young
Republicans, the largest YR chapter
west of the Mississippi, sent 28 delegates
to the Convention and was the largest

Michael Kuhl was elected President
of the California College Republicans
yesterday at their Convention in San
Diego.
Kuhl, Associate Editor of The Daily
and past President of the Stanford Area
Young Republicans, defeated Merritt
Hemenway of California State College
at Los Angeles and Mike Sholer of the
University of California at Irvine.
Delegates from over a hundred
Young Republicans chapters at different
colleges and universities in California
attended the Convention, which was

held at the Hilton Inn in San Diego this
past week-end.
The Convention saw the merger of
two campus organizations—the
California Young Republican College
Federation (CYRCF) and the California
College Republicans (CCR). The new
organization adopted the name of the
California College Republicans.
United Support
Peter Chase, outgoing President of
CYRCF, said of Kuhl; "He'll have the
united support of the new
organization."
Hemenway led the race through the
first ballot. Sholer, was was trailing,
then withdrew and threw his support to
Kuhl, giving him a margin of 168-132
over Hemenway at the close of voting.
Many attributed Kuhl's election to
his reputation as a campus activist at
Stanford and his experience in the
Young Republicans. He is a junior in
economics and sociology, Associate
Editor of The Daily, a member of the
Student Education Council, and
Chairman of the San Mateo County
Young Republicans.
Political Experience
Last year Michael Kuhl was the
director of the Young Republicans
chapters in Area XI, which extends over
four counties. He was President of the
Stanford Area Young Republicans last
fall.
Hemenway, the outgoing Executive
Vice-President of CYRCF said, "I hope
Michael doesn't have too many
commitments already. It's a full-time
job. To get everyone behind him, he'll
have to perform."
Bill Boyd, President of the Stanford
YRs and campaign manager for Kuhl at
the Convention, was optomistic: "When
Michael was president of the Stanford
chapter, he greatly helped to enhance
the credibility of the YRs in the
community at large. I am sure he will be
able to do the same thing on a
state-wide level."
State-Wide Move
In a letter circulated among the
delegates, Kuhl wrote, "The time is
right to establish a state-wide college
political organization through which to
challenge the positions of the radical
left and mobilize a 'constructive
majority.' " Throughout the campaign,
Kuhl urged the state organization to
