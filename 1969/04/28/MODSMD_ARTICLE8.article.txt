# The 						SRI Hearing
## 
### 
The fourth week in April begins witli
Stanford's future unsettled at best.
Confrontation by mid-week seems almost
inevitable. Massive crisis for the University
by the weekend is possible. Every member
of this community should be cognizant of
the realities. Reasonable discussion, not
blind action, is urgent. Unfortunately,
reason is rapidly taking a second priority
position to tactics and strategy among both
trustees and student antagonists.
The SRI issue remains the central
dispute, but the immediate issue this week
is the Trustee hearing on SRI, now
precariously scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon. It is important that everyone at
Stanford understand the background and
implications of this hearing.
For the past month, the Trustees have
advanced the idea of a public hearing on
SRI to prove their desire for
"communication." The public hearing idea
first appeared during a meeting of the
University Advisory Committee (UAC) on
March 31. Faculty and student members of
the UAC urged that the entire Board be
present. Trustee members would agree only
to a "committee of the Board," with the
vague understanding that the committee
would include most of the 23 trustees.
On April 10, in the midst of the AEL
sit-in, the Academic Senate asked that the
public hearing definitely take place before
the end of the month, and that "as many
Trustees as possible attend the open
hearings."
On April 13, Board president W. Parmer
Fuller 111 said that he would try to sot a
date for the hearing on April 16 and
announce the trustees who would attend
by April 1 8.
But Fuller was evidently unsuccessful.
For 10 days, we heard nothing more about
the hearing. Finally the Daily ran an
editorial April 24 urging that the hearing
date be announced as soon as possible.
Later that day, Pitzer issued a statement
announcing that five trustees would hear
testimony from pre-selected persons in an

undisclosed location, all to be broadcast on
KZSU.
ASSU President Denis Hayes was called
Thursday night and told the news. "Let me
guess who the five Trustees are," he said
playfully. He named them all
correctly-Morris Doyle, Mrs. Allan
Charles, Richard Cuggenhime, Robert M.
Brown, and Ben C. Duniway. Astounded,
his caller asked him how he could guess so
accurately. "It's easy," Hayes replied
wearily, "those are the only trustees who
live in this area and don't have any ties to
defense industries."
Hayes's insight reveals critical failures in
the hearing plans. Unless numerous
powerful Board members are present—there
is no indication that William Hewlett and
others will attend—the hearing can hardly
be informative to most Trustees in
absentia, let alone allow a dialogue between
Trustees and the community. The Trustees
promised communication; their plans foster
misunderstanding and resentment.
Another trustee, John Gardner, is
visiting campus today and tomorrow to
discuss reorganization of the Board with all
segments of campus opinion. While it is
reasonable that the April 3rd Movement
would want to meet with Gardner, it would
be unreasonable and dangerous for them to
disrupt any of Gardner's other meetings
and alienate perhaps the most intelligent,
progressive trustee.
The trustees have the final power and
responsibility to act on SRI. We, as a
community, are fervently interested in
meeting the trustees and giving them our
views and hearing theirs. An open meeting
of the entire board is clearly essential. We
ask Messrs. Pitzer and Fuller to work to
bring such a meeting about as soon as
possible. And we ask all members of the
community to allow such a meeting to take
place with no disruptions or
demonstrations of any kind.
We believe, even at this late hour, that
we can sit down and talk with one another.

Charles, Richard Cuggenhime, Robert M.
Brown, and Ben C. Duniway. Astounded,
his caller asked him how he could guess so
accurately. "It's easy," Hayes replied
wearily, "those are the only trustees who
live in this area and don't have any ties to
defense industries."
Hayes's insight reveals critical failures in
the hearing plans. Unless numerous
powerful Board members are present—there
is no indication that William Hewlett and
others will attend—the hearing can hardly
be informative to most Trustees in
absentia, let alone allow a dialogue between
Trustees and the community. The Trustees
promised communication; their plans foster
misunderstanding and resentment.
Another trustee, John Gardner, is
visiting campus today and tomorrow to
discuss reorganization of the Board with all
segments of campus opinion. While it is
reasonable that the April 3rd Movement
would want to meet with Gardner, it would
be unreasonable and dangerous for them to
disrupt any of Gardner's other meetings
and alienate perhaps the most intelligent,
progressive trustee.
The trustees have the final power and
responsibility to act on SRI. We, as a
community, are fervently interested in
meeting the trustees and giving them our
views and hearing theirs. An open meeting
of the entire board is clearly essential. We
ask Messrs. Pitzer and Fuller to work to
bring such a meeting about as soon as
possible. And we ask all members of the
community to allow such a meeting to take
place with no disruptions or
demonstrations of any kind.
We believe, even at this late hour, that
we can sit down and talk with one another.
The fourth week in April begins witli
Stanford's future unsettled at best.
Confrontation by mid-week seems almost
inevitable. Massive crisis for the University
by the weekend is possible. Every member
of this community should be cognizant of
the realities. Reasonable discussion, not
blind action, is urgent. Unfortunately,
reason is rapidly taking a second priority
position to tactics and strategy among both
trustees and student antagonists.
The SRI issue remains the central
dispute, but the immediate issue this week
is the Trustee hearing on SRI, now
precariously scheduled for Wednesday
afternoon. It is important that everyone at
Stanford understand the background and
implications of this hearing.
For the past month, the Trustees have
advanced the idea of a public hearing on
SRI to prove their desire for
"communication." The public hearing idea
first appeared during a meeting of the
University Advisory Committee (UAC) on
March 31. Faculty and student members of
the UAC urged that the entire Board be
present. Trustee members would agree only
to a "committee of the Board," with the
vague understanding that the committee
would include most of the 23 trustees.
On April 10, in the midst of the AEL
sit-in, the Academic Senate asked that the
public hearing definitely take place before
the end of the month, and that "as many
Trustees as possible attend the open
hearings."
On April 13, Board president W. Parmer
Fuller 111 said that he would try to sot a
date for the hearing on April 16 and
announce the trustees who would attend
by April 1 8.
But Fuller was evidently unsuccessful.
For 10 days, we heard nothing more about
the hearing. Finally the Daily ran an
editorial April 24 urging that the hearing
date be announced as soon as possible.
Later that day, Pitzer issued a statement
announcing that five trustees would hear
testimony from pre-selected persons in an

undisclosed location, all to be broadcast on
KZSU.
ASSU President Denis Hayes was called
Thursday night and told the news. "Let me
guess who the five Trustees are," he said
playfully. He named them all
correctly-Morris Doyle, Mrs. Allan
Charles, Richard Cuggenhime, Robert M.
Brown, and Ben C. Duniway. Astounded,
his caller asked him how he could guess so
accurately. "It's easy," Hayes replied
wearily, "those are the only trustees who
live in this area and don't have any ties to
defense industries."
