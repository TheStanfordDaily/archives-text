# The 						Fourth Virtue
## Eat-In Raises Issues 
### Felicity Barringer 
It has been very heartening in
the past week to see that the
shifting focus of moral concern
has alighted upon what is possibly
one of the most pressing and
pertinent issues facing today's
society.
Last Wednesday's Daily,
reporting the panel discussions
which were held during the
Tuesday 'Day of Concern,'
spotlighted the new issue on the
front page, along with such widely
disputed topics as "Secrecy,"
"SRI and Stanford," "CI
Warfare" and "Morality."
Lunchtime has, after all, been a
much-neglected issue in the past.
But all that has changed. A
mushrooming controversy has
centered itself around this very
point. It is no longer possible for
the Stanford Community to
disregard the far-reaching
implications of the subject.
Members of the SDS (Students
for Democratic Stomachs) have
been working relentlessly to bring
the more unpleasant ramifications
of the issue into the public eye.
Their celebrated break-up of the
Trustees' luncheon last January
was only one step in their
long-range plans.
Start Eating
"We've got to stop thinking
and start eating," SDS member
Dave Pugh announced at a rally
held last Thursday at (when else?)
lunchtime in White Plaza. Cries of
"Eat on!" greeted his declaration.
Buttons reading "Power to the
Digestive Juices" were passed out
among the crowd, whose number
exceeded 200.
The group was divided,
however, when the question of
tactics arose. Suggested locations
for an "Eat-In" were at the center
of the debate. Some students
favored an occupation of
Tresidder Union's kitchens,
arguing that the takeover of such
an overt tool of the Establishment
would quickly mobilize
community support for the aims
of the eat-in.
More moderate students
expressed the opinion that they
would not go to the militant
extremes of eating Tresidder's
food until all other methods of
eating within the existing
framework were exhausted. The
meeting broke up in confusion. A
few of the group volunteered to
leaflet at Stickney's, The Round
Table, the Beef n' Barrel, and

other local restaurants, to
publicize the cause. There was no
discussion on the suggestion of
organizing tours of the
gastronomical-industrial complex.
Bring Pepto-Bismol
A complicity statement was
drawn up after the rally, in the
event that the eat-in might take
place. It read simply "I am eating
a pork chop in Tresidder Union.
Bring Pepto-Bismol."
University President Kenneth
S. Pitzer, when contacted after
the rally, said that he had referred
all matters of food to the
University Committee on Food
Services. He reminded all
concerned students that this
committee is chaired by a student.
He stated further that he could
make no decision on the issue
without first reading the
committee's report.
A self-appointed group
researching the Food Services
Committee issued a statement
questioning its legitimacy soon
after P itzer's statement was
released. They cited a case of
menu-title changing to support
their charge. The Wilbur Food
Service allegedly crossed out the
heading "Mystery Meat" from the
menu, and inserted instead the
heading "Swiss Steak" last week.
"We will not allow such
flagrant misrepresentations to go
unchallenged," a spokesman for
the group announced. "We
seriously question the legitimacy
of a committee who would let an
occurrence like this go
unnoticed."
Harvey H. Hukari, Editor of
The Arena and President of the
Stanford chapter of the Young
Americans for Freedom, remarked
after Thursday's rally that he
believed in the right of the
individual to eat as he wished.
"We must not let ourselves be
coerced out of food freedom by a
vocal minority," he said. He
added a warning to SDS: "We
cannot guarantee that if violence
or coercion are used by those
wishing to destroy our freedoms,
we will not take counter
measures. We will not stand for a
sit-in."
Speaking at a luncheon of the
Pasadena Women's Club, William
Hewlett, a member of Stanford's
Board of Trustees, expressed
confidence in both lunch and
food. "Lunch is a service
performed for America. I hardly

think it is political to support it,"
he stated.
bating And Thinking
Student body president Patrick
Shea, speaking for the
new 1 y - elected Council of
Presidents, expressed hope that
there would be further rational
dialogue between all parties
concerned before any took action.
He added that the searching
discussion of the issue is " . . .a
step forward. People eat without
thinking. It is time we woke up."
Contacted after the rally and
questioned as to the possibility of
an Academic Senate meeting
being called soon to discuss the
new issue, Senate chairman
Leonard Schiff responded, "As
long as the students continue to
eat, the senate cannot meet."
A special meeting of the
Academic Senate was called for
Friday morning over Schiff's
protests. Three hours after the
closed-door session began, Schiff
emerged out onto the steps of
Dinkelspiel Auditorium to
announce that the faculty had
passed a unanimous resolution
expressing concern over the issue.
He discussed briefly the question
of 'gastrodemic freedom' and the
subtleties it entails in a University
context.
Schiff further announced that
all other motions had been tabled.
So be it.
