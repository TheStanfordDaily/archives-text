# Atoms For Peace Award Given Prof
## 
### 
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, a pioneer in
radiobiology and the application of
supervoltage and electron beam therapy
in cancer, was named today a recipient
of the Atoms for Peace Award.
He is one of seven scientists from
four countries selected to receive Atoms
for Peace Awards for pioneering work in
peaceful uses of atomic energy in the
last decade.
These awards, and the previously
announced award to the late Dwight D.
Eisenhower, will be presented May 14 in
Washington, D.C. They will conclude a
program begun 14 years ago to
recognize distinguished contributors to
the peaceful uses of the atom.
Leukemia Study
Dr. Kaplan was cited for research
which has contributed to understanding
how radiation induces leukemia in mice,
and for the development of the "cancer
gun" at Stanford University Medical
Center. He was also cited for his
introduction of radiation biology into
clinical radiation therapy training
programs.
When Dr. Kaplan organized the
Department of Radiology at Stanford
20 years ago, he felt that early work in
radiology had been done by physicians
whose prime orientation was toward
pathological anatomy, perpetuating an
emphasis on static images. "It was clear
to me that the stature of the field
depended upon research," he told an
interviewer recently.
He founded the department with two
points of research emphasis. The first
was encouragement of the study of
motion—blood flow and valve action—in
diagnostic radiology, which represented
a movement into applied physiology.
The other point, in radiation therapy,
was an effort to understand radiation
biology.
Education
After graduating from Rush Medical
School in 1940, Dr. Kaplan served his
internship and residency at Michael

Reese Hospital. He then went on to the
University of Minnesota, Yale, and the
Public Health Service before coming to
Stanford in 1948.
Three years later he asked the
Stanford physics department to
investigate the possibility of adapting a
new high-energy physics device, the
linear accelerator, for medical
application. After helping design the
necessary apparatus, he set standards for
its use.
"It was like getting a new
high-powered rifle," Dr. Kaplan recalls.
"You couldn't go out and use it like an
old shotgun."
The linear accelerator technically
liberated Dr. Kaplan and his associates
for further work on Hodgkin's disease
and other malignant cancers.
With the megavoltage beam, he was
able to irradiate a larger area and
consequently developed "the mantle
technique," which allowed irradiation
of all the lymph nodes of the neck and
thorax at one time. As a result, he
records an 80 to 90 per cent cure rate
for early stages of Hodgkin's disease,
and more recently has succeeded in
obtaining five-year survivals in advanced
cases as well.
Dr. Kaplan has also dispelled the
theory that, in leukemia, x-rays and
chemical agents mutate the cells so they
behave as cancer. In his work with mice,
he has shown an indirect induction
mechanism whereby irradiation or a
chemical trigger a latent virus.
Dr. Kaplan also has shed much light
on the fundamental biologic effects of
radiation. He and others have gathered
overwhelming evidence that DNA (the
cell's hereditary material), is the target
molecule in the cell for radiation
effects. With this information, Dr.
Kaplan has been developing drugs which
are picked up by the DNA and increase
radiation sensitivity. He has now moved
some of these studies to the clinical
stage.

He founded the department with two
points of research emphasis. The first
was encouragement of the study of
motion—blood flow and valve action—in
diagnostic radiology, which represented
a movement into applied physiology.
The other point, in radiation therapy,
was an effort to understand radiation
biology.
Education
After graduating from Rush Medical
School in 1940, Dr. Kaplan served his
internship and residency at Michael

Reese Hospital. He then went on to the
University of Minnesota, Yale, and the
Public Health Service before coming to
Stanford in 1948.
Three years later he asked the
Stanford physics department to
investigate the possibility of adapting a
new high-energy physics device, the
linear accelerator, for medical
application. After helping design the
necessary apparatus, he set standards for
its use.
"It was like getting a new
high-powered rifle," Dr. Kaplan recalls.
"You couldn't go out and use it like an
old shotgun."
The linear accelerator technically
liberated Dr. Kaplan and his associates
for further work on Hodgkin's disease
and other malignant cancers.
With the megavoltage beam, he was
able to irradiate a larger area and
consequently developed "the mantle
technique," which allowed irradiation
of all the lymph nodes of the neck and
thorax at one time. As a result, he
records an 80 to 90 per cent cure rate
for early stages of Hodgkin's disease,
and more recently has succeeded in
obtaining five-year survivals in advanced
cases as well.
Dr. Kaplan has also dispelled the
theory that, in leukemia, x-rays and
chemical agents mutate the cells so they
behave as cancer. In his work with mice,
he has shown an indirect induction
mechanism whereby irradiation or a
chemical trigger a latent virus.
Dr. Kaplan also has shed much light
on the fundamental biologic effects of
radiation. He and others have gathered
overwhelming evidence that DNA (the
cell's hereditary material), is the target
molecule in the cell for radiation
effects. With this information, Dr.
Kaplan has been developing drugs which
are picked up by the DNA and increase
radiation sensitivity. He has now moved
some of these studies to the clinical
stage.
Dr. Henry S. Kaplan, a pioneer in
radiobiology and the application of
supervoltage and electron beam therapy
in cancer, was named today a recipient
of the Atoms for Peace Award.
He is one of seven scientists from
four countries selected to receive Atoms
for Peace Awards for pioneering work in
peaceful uses of atomic energy in the
last decade.
These awards, and the previously
announced award to the late Dwight D.
Eisenhower, will be presented May 14 in
Washington, D.C. They will conclude a
program begun 14 years ago to
recognize distinguished contributors to
the peaceful uses of the atom.
Leukemia Study
Dr. Kaplan was cited for research
which has contributed to understanding
how radiation induces leukemia in mice,
and for the development of the "cancer
gun" at Stanford University Medical
Center. He was also cited for his
introduction of radiation biology into
clinical radiation therapy training
programs.
When Dr. Kaplan organized the
Department of Radiology at Stanford
20 years ago, he felt that early work in
radiology had been done by physicians
whose prime orientation was toward
pathological anatomy, perpetuating an
emphasis on static images. "It was clear
to me that the stature of the field
depended upon research," he told an
interviewer recently.
