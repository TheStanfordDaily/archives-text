## Forgotten Goals 
### 
Stanford University has lost its way in the wilderness of politics,
confrontations, industrial parks, and research institutes.
In the midst of crisis it is difficult but essential to continue asking
questions and looking beyond the next day's events. Why did we
come here? What did we expect from Stanford? Indeed, what is the
university?
Tension, deadlines, and demands create excitement and action.
Industrial parks produce income and employment, and applied
research centers develop immediately operable results. But are these
the chosen, desirable goals of a university?
Conservatives argue, to quote William Shannon, an editorial writer
of the N.Y. Times, "The nation's universities and their ideals are now
under siege. The attack comes from some youngsters who are
ignorant of those ideals, from others who are emotionally disturbed
and prone to violence, and from still others who have willfully
chosen to be political totalitarians."
Obviously, to Shannon, radicals can do no right. The other side
argues that radicals are acting to rid the university of its ill-fitting,
dangerous, and immoral activities. The ideals, it is said, are surely
under siege, not by radicals, but by the military-industrial-govern
mental complex. SRI and AEL are specific examples.
Both arguments are familiar, and far too concrete at Stanford. It
is hardly news that The Daily does not endorse William Shannon.
Vet sympathy, even involvement with the radical cause does not
preclude some cautious exploration of the dilemma now facing
Stanford. The University has been slowly placed at the mercy of the
left and the right. In the end, some of the simpler ideals of the
university may be forgotten or destroyed. Perhaps they have already
ceased to exist.
Deep and intense concentration is a wistful goal in the swirl of the
modern university. Today we solve the problem of a better nerve gas
or a better sit-in tactic rather than the finer, tougher questions of
intellectual dispute, historical theory, or mathematical equation.
The classroom, despite its many handicaps for relevance or
involvement, offers mental stimulation and diversity of opinion.
It may be too late to change, it may even be wrong to try, but the
values of openness, and humane research are still within our grasp,
and even within our tactic.
Stanford has been co-opted by society and is now being
bludgeoned by demonstrations to free it. It must be freed, but the
fight must not demolish or obscure the broader concerns and the
rapidly vanishing goals.
