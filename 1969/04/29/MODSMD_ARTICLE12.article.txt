# Gardner Finishing Two-Day Visit Here
## 
### 
Trustee John Gardner, head of
the Urban Coalition and former
Secretary of Health, Education,
and Welfare, will conclude a
two-day visit to campus today by
continuing a series of conferences
with student leaders, faculty, and
administration.
At present, Gardner does not
plan to stay at Stanford for the
Trustee hearing on SRI
Wednesday afternoon, "I have too
many bills before Congress" to
spend another day here, he said
yesterday.
Gardner's original purpose in
coming to Stanford was to gather
student and faculty opinion on
what changes should be made in
the Board of Trustees, although
the SRI issue has also been
brought up in his talks.
Committee Chairman
He is chairman of a five-man
Board committee studying that
question. Groups with which
Gardner conferred yesterday
included the deans of the various
schools, the incoming and
outgoing ASSU presidents, the
University Advisory Committee,
editors of The Daily, and faculty
imembers. Similar discussions will
continue today.
Members of the April 3
Movement (A3M) asked Gardner

several times yesterday to
participate in a mass meeting with
students on the SRI question,
either in White Plaza or Memorial
Auditorium.
Before his first scheduled
meeting, Steve Smith of SDS
approached Gardner and made
this request. Later, Mary Hansen
also asked him to appear at a mass
meeting, after presenting the
trustee with some literature on
the issue.
Requests Declined
Gardner turned down the
requests to appear, saying he
would be glad to meet with
Movement members in small
groups "where discussion is
possible," but felt that a mass
meeting would only lead to
"theatrics."
Gardner, who has been on the
Board only since October,
commented that he had "learned
a lot" during his first day of talks.
Despite several rumors that he
was going to appear at the new
Movement headquarters, Gardner
did not go to the Clubhouse at
any time during the day.
An A3M spokesman last night
said his group would meet at
12:30 today for lunch and try to
arrange a meeting with Gardner
for this afternoon.
