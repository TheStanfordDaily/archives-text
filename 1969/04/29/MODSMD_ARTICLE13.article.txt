## Perspective On Campus Concerns 
### Scott Cummins 
The English building is one
thousand and forty-eight steps
from my dorm. If you multiply
that by 2, you get two thousand
and ninety-six. If you walfc you
can go by sidewalk and you are
bound to meet someone. I did
both. I heard voices coming at me.
One voice was L low and the other
was high, an 4 they bounced back
and forth like a summer tennis
ball.
"One thing about it, is that if
the trustees don't give in, I'm
afraid there is going to be
trouble."
"Of course there will be
trouble. There is always trouble.
We've got to liberate people."
I was free to keep moving.
Click, click of her bright heels and
the sidewalk and the stars and
then she was gone. So was he, so

was the tennis game. But more
voices now.
"Of course you've got to join a
fraternity. How else can you have
a social life?"
"Yeah, Eddie it's great. You're
never alone when you have the
brothers. Do you know the secret
handshake?"
"Oh you mean the grip. Yeah,
Ron taught it to me."
"God, I'd sure hate to be left
out of a fraternity."
I passed them. I saw them in
the light, and then their shadows.
They were like sitting ducks. Only
you had to buy a license before
you could shoot in my state. A
girl's voice teetered ahead.
"Oh Rick, what will mother
say when she hears of it?"
"I'm tired of hearing about

your mother. I don't give a damn.
If you want out . . .?"
"Oh Rick!"
Oh Rick, oh Rick in the
streetlight where I could see his
bulging belly and down below it
hung his pants, past the point of
no return. You see workmen
wearing pants like that. Rick, I
thought, your stomach is past the
point of no return too.
1 went into the building and sat
down. It was light and I could
smell flowers. I could smell my
home in those flowers. Then there
were footsteps, heavier footsteps
than mine. The door squeaked
open.
"Well lookee here!"
"It's the nuts."
"Bad, huh."
"Yep, it's always that way.

Restless, seems like I'm always
restless."
"But the stars are out."
"Yes, thank God."
"You'll get back, just be
patient. Lord, you got to be
patient or you're gonna foul your
insides."
"Oh Ise, what's it now, April?
They'll be planting cotton now
won't they, then grain and the
peach trees will be in bloom."
"Yep," he shook a dirty
fingernail, "pale pale pink and a
washed out blue sky. I remember
in Arkansas 'bout now we'd be
laying de grain. But cotton too,
'ceptin we don't plant cotton.
Too expensive. Why a bottle of
poison cost 50 dollar. Bollweevil
don't cost nothin'."
"Yeah, and always the land."
"Don't worry yourself. The
land is always gonna be there.
And you'll get back. Just the land
boy, just the land."
"Thanks, Ise."
"Jest be patient."
"Sure."
"Don't worry now. Worry is
like a woman. She don't do
nuthin' for ya so just leave her."
His dirty fingernails on the
door disappeared. I went over and
flicked off the light and left. I was
tired of studying. I could hear
voices coming again. "Come on
we've got to hurry. The meeting is
tonight and everything will be
decided." Everything? I looked up
at the stars. They seemed ever so
clear. I though of Nehemiah on
the wall. Tonight was the meeting,
but back home they would be
asleep, because tomorrow,
tomorrow they would be planting
cotton.
Scott Cummins is a freshman
who says, surprisingly, that
sometimes he'd rather pick cotton
in Arkansas than polish apples at
Stanford â€” Ed.)
