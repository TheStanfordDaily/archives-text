# Will You Join Me?
## Draft Card Turn-In 
### Diarmuid McGuire 
I am going to get rid of my
draft card on May Day, which is
Thursday. I would like to say a
few things about the reasoning
that led to this decision, in the
hope that some people may join
me in resistance.
The process that brought me to
this point started with loneliness
and the feeling that I was unable
to affect the course of my life.
Considering the fact that I am
often lonely, I discovered a
recurring pattern of thought.
Later I decided to call it a myth.
"If you are lonely," says the
myth, "There must be something
wrong with you. Maybe you are
ugly or neurotic. Go have a nose
job or see a psychiatrist.
"Above all, do not admit that
you are lonely. That is called
self-pity, and it means you are
weak. If people know you are
weak, they will despise you.
"Then you will be more lonely
than you are now, impossible as
that may seem."
This kind of thinking looked
circular to me. It also seemed to
require individuals to blame
themselves for social problems.
While I was thinking about this
kind of stuff, I was also trying to
figure out why I could not seem
to make any decisions for myself.
At each major turning point in my
life, choices I made (college, Peace
Corps, high school teaching,
graduate school) seemed to be
determined by forces that were
beyond my control. Like my
parents and the Selective Service
System.
Oddly enough the Selective
Service System seemed to be
involved in many of my parents'

arguments about why I should go
to college, join the Peace Corps
and so forth.
In thinking about the draft, I
came upon another interesting
line of reasoning. In my fantasy, it
is explained to me by an
impressive, reasonable, carefully
groomed man who always wears a
grey suit and a good tan.
"You say you find killing
distasteful," he says. "Your
humanitarianism is to be
applauded, of course. But you
must be aware of certain realities.
It may be necessary for you to kill
some people, or help kill them, in
order to preserve your freedom.
"Now, if you have not thought
about the matter with sufficient
vigor, this might seem to be a
contradiction. But we must ask
you to give up your human, and
even Constitutional, rights in
order to preserve your freedom.
You must be prepared to serve in
the Armed Forces whether you
like it or not.
"Do not think of this as
oppression. That word is just
rhetoric. Rhetoric is like
propaganda. Only fanatics and
other misfits use it. If people hear
you talk about oppression, they
will despise you."
The logic of loneliness and the
logic of oppression began to form
a pattern in my mind. Both
seemed designed to prevent open
questioning of the problem. I
came to believe that loneliness
might be functional in an
oppressive system. Fragmented,
rootless individuals, I thought

would be useful to massive,
impersonal economic and political
systems. Like the corporations
and the government that almmost
everyone seems bound to serve.
I still do not know exactly how
to be free. But I would like to give
it a try. And the April 3
Movement has indicated an
interesting strategy.
Some people decided that
certain kinds of research were
oppressive both to those
struggling for freedom in the
Third World and to those who
were struggling for a relevant
education is a distorted university.
They went to the building where
the research was being done and
stopped it, using the force of their
collective, non-violent action.
One of the things that people
said during the sit-in was that they
were getting to know each other.
It seemed that loneliness as well as
militaristic research was in danger
at AEL.
I want to get together with
some people on Thursday and try
something like that. I want to
disprove the myths I have learned.
I want to be part of a movement
that will confront, openly and
without fear, the system that
oppresses me.
Will you join me?
(EDITOR'S NOTE: There will
be a meeting ot those interested in
non-cooperation with the draft in
the Clubhouse this afternoon at
4:00.
