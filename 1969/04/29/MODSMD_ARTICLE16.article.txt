# From The Ivory Tower
## Sit-In Provides No Answers 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The weekly deadline for this
article has arrived, but it is not a
propitious time for the scholarly
overview of some new point of
scientific discovery or technique.
For over a week a group of
Stanford undergraduates have
''occupied" the Applied
Electronics Laboratories with the
aim of expressing their
exasperation over the pace (rather
brisk by usual standards) of the
university's response to a number
of demands.
These issues are not simple
ones: they go to the roots of the
nature of democratic society. The
same students who cry the loudest
for individual freedom are the
most vehement in demanding the
most stringent control of the
work of others in what they
regard as reprehensible research.
At the present moment this is
defined as military technology. It
is perfectly obvious that this is a
matter of infinite regress; other
lines of work are already attacked
as insufficiently "relevant." As
often happens, the main thrust of
these ideas is shared by the
authoritarian right and left.
A system of judicial review has
been established since last year's
disturbances, and there is little
thought of amnesty for clear
violations of the community's
rules of behavior. There is, or
ought to be, a general perception
that such violations cannot be
made with inpunity, and that the
campus will become a shambles if
the sit-in becomes the normal
mode of expressing and
attempting to resolve differences
of policy. I hope there is also the
sense that any sanctions are
imposed with the aim of
deterrence, not vindictiveness
about a demonstration whose
outcome, has, so far, been far less
destructive than anyone could
rationally have expected.
Might lie Reluctant
Those who demand the early
use of main force to clear a
campus building might be more
reluctant to do this if their own
children were immediately
involved. They are also playing
right into the hands of the
militant core, the haters, those
whose open aim is the destruction

of contemporary society and who
find the university the most
available target.
No one has yet discovered how
to apply such police force without
injuring more naive or innocent
bystanders than core activists. The
life commitment of their
peripheral group is the main value
at stake. The provocation of a
brutal response is the
main weapon in this struggle.
The Stanford situation was
especially precarious because the
building contained security files
with classified information. How
easily the militants could have
permanently incriminated the
other students by an escalation of
their group anger to the point that
any one of them began to
penetrate the files!
If classified material of this
sensitivity is to be maintained on
a university campus at all, it must
be guarded well enough in the
first instance to minimize its
tempting role as target. This kind
of incursion of non-academic
commitments into university life
is one of the most legitimate
complaints that the students
might make. Such files are, after
all, an equally tempting target for
violent intrusions by espionage
agents.
Unrealistic Answers
The students are equally
exercised about many other issues
that they are not the first to
discover, and whose proposed
answers are undoubtedly

oversimplified in an unrealistic
and unworkable way.
Why do our national priorities
remain so tragically confused?
How can we, for example, retain a
commitment to secret work in
biological warfare research, whose
secrecy iteself feeds unrealistic
fantasies, whose persistence
encourages the proliferation of
comparable efforts in other
countries to the detriment of the
whole world's security, and whose
strategic advantages are so futile
next to the nuclear deterrent?
I believe that our students
could better lend their intelligence
than their mass of their emotions

and bodies in pursuing the
answers to these problems. I
deplore that even a small minority
plays games with the use of force
in the vanishing expectation that
parental reactions will be
restrained. But why should they
not be angry at the shape of their
inheritance?
