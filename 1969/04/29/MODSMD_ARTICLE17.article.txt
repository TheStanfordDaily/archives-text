# Campus Films To Portray Different Aspects Of War
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Five of this week's pictures
deal with various aspects of war,
two being documentaries and
three taking a comic or satiric
approach.
The Western Civ film on
Tuesday and Wednesday at 4:15
and 7:30 in Cubberley is a
Swedish documentary, Mein
Kampf. The Naxis having
recorded most of their activities
on celluloid, this film includes
sequences of the Warsaw ghetto,
concentration camps and behind
the scenes looks at the war from
the German point of view, as well
as historical footage on Hitler and
the Nazi party.
Key Largo is a top-flight
forties' gangster film, with Bogart,
Bacall, Edward G. Robinson and
Lionel Barrymore creating the
expected mysterious mayhem in
Key West Florida. John Huston
directed and Claire Trevor won an
Academy Award in this most
entertaining picture, being shown
in Geology 320 on Tuesday night.
The I-Center film this week is
an Austrian comedy made in

1961. The Good Soldier Schweik
tells the story of a stray dog
dealer who, upon the outbreak of
WWI, makes the mistake of saying
what he thinks. The Army then
puts him through a series of
hilarious psychiatric tests which
provoke both audience laughter
and contemplation. In Physics
Tank on Thursday at 8:15.
To Die in Madrid is a
semi-documentary which pays
tribute to the defeated Loyalists
of the Spanish Civil War.
Acclaimed by many as a brilliant
mixture of newsreel and
modern-day footage, the film will
be shown in Cubberley at 7:30 on
Thursday.
King of Hearts is, to my mind,
one of the great-but-forgotten
films of the sixties. Directed by
Phillipe de Broca (That Man From
Rio), this sympathetic farce
details the take-over of a deserted
French town by the inmates of a
local insane asylum. Alan Bates is
marvellous in this low-keyed
satire, which, in addition to
having beautiful color
photography and a fine musical
score by Georges Delerue, is
sensitive, romantic and mocking

in delicious combination. With
Genevieve Bujold and Jean-Claude
Brialy. At Cubberley on Friday
night.
Also on Friday night (at
Tresidder) is one of Luis Bunuel's
very best films, Exterminating
Angel. It is a controversial film on
a decaying society. A 1932 short
by Bunuel, titled "Las Hurdes"
will also be shown.
Notorious, on Saturday night
at Tresidder, is Truffaut's favorite
Hitchcock film and was one of the
master's greatest popular
successes. This spy intrigue, set in
Rio, stars Ingrid Bergman, Cary
Grant, Claude Rains and Louis
Calhern.
Richard Lester, just before the
release of How I Won the War,
said that if he were struck by a car
and killed tomorrow, he would
stake his directorial reputation on
this film. I personally am glad he
lived to make Petulia, for 1 found
War utterly without social or
political editorial value, and even
less successful as entertainment.
There are those who disagree,
however, and you can decide for
yourself on Sunday at the flicks.

release of How I Won the War,
said that if he were struck by a car
and killed tomorrow, he would
stake his directorial reputation on
this film. I personally am glad he
lived to make Petulia, for 1 found
War utterly without social or
political editorial value, and even
less successful as entertainment.
There are those who disagree,
however, and you can decide for
yourself on Sunday at the flicks.
Five of this week's pictures
deal with various aspects of war,
two being documentaries and
three taking a comic or satiric
approach.
The Western Civ film on
Tuesday and Wednesday at 4:15
and 7:30 in Cubberley is a
Swedish documentary, Mein
Kampf. The Naxis having
recorded most of their activities
on celluloid, this film includes
sequences of the Warsaw ghetto,
concentration camps and behind
the scenes looks at the war from
the German point of view, as well
as historical footage on Hitler and
the Nazi party.
Key Largo is a top-flight
forties' gangster film, with Bogart,
Bacall, Edward G. Robinson and
Lionel Barrymore creating the
expected mysterious mayhem in
Key West Florida. John Huston
directed and Claire Trevor won an
Academy Award in this most
entertaining picture, being shown
in Geology 320 on Tuesday night.
The I-Center film this week is
an Austrian comedy made in

1961. The Good Soldier Schweik
tells the story of a stray dog
dealer who, upon the outbreak of
WWI, makes the mistake of saying
what he thinks. The Army then
puts him through a series of
hilarious psychiatric tests which
provoke both audience laughter
and contemplation. In Physics
Tank on Thursday at 8:15.
To Die in Madrid is a
semi-documentary which pays
tribute to the defeated Loyalists
of the Spanish Civil War.
Acclaimed by many as a brilliant
mixture of newsreel and
modern-day footage, the film will
be shown in Cubberley at 7:30 on
Thursday.
King of Hearts is, to my mind,
one of the great-but-forgotten
films of the sixties. Directed by
Phillipe de Broca (That Man From
Rio), this sympathetic farce
details the take-over of a deserted
French town by the inmates of a
local insane asylum. Alan Bates is
marvellous in this low-keyed
satire, which, in addition to
having beautiful color
photography and a fine musical
score by Georges Delerue, is
sensitive, romantic and mocking

in delicious combination. With
Genevieve Bujold and Jean-Claude
Brialy. At Cubberley on Friday
night.
Also on Friday night (at
Tresidder) is one of Luis Bunuel's
very best films, Exterminating
Angel. It is a controversial film on
a decaying society. A 1932 short
by Bunuel, titled "Las Hurdes"
will also be shown.
Notorious, on Saturday night
at Tresidder, is Truffaut's favorite
Hitchcock film and was one of the
master's greatest popular
successes. This spy intrigue, set in
Rio, stars Ingrid Bergman, Cary
Grant, Claude Rains and Louis
Calhern.
Richard Lester, just before the
release of How I Won the War,
said that if he were struck by a car
and killed tomorrow, he would
stake his directorial reputation on
this film. I personally am glad he
lived to make Petulia, for 1 found
