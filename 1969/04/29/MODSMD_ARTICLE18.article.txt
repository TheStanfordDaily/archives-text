# Black Student Union Converts House Into Cultural Arts Center
## 
### 
The Black Student Union's
demand for the use of a university
building to be used as a black
cultural arts center has been
granted by the University
ad ministration.
During Spring recess, the
administration provided
Stanford's BSU with the small
wooden building adjacent to
Bowman Alumni House to be
used as a meeting place and
cultural center for Blacks. This
follows similar administrative
action at universities such as Yale,
Cornell, and the University of
Wisconsin.
According to BSU Artistic
Director Johnie Scott, "Black
House" is sponsoring classes and
rehearsals in Black drama as
preparation for a series of plays to
be presented later this quarter.
Meetings of the East Palo Alto
tutorial program and regular
sections of English 175,
"Literature of Black America,"
are also held there.
In addition, Black House is the
headquarters for the BSU's

newspaper, The Colonist,
lea Luring, "local as well as
international political, cultural,
and economic concerns of
Blacks," according to Scott. Black
House will also sponsor
breakfasts, lunches, and teas for
Black students after it is
decorated and furnished with
various items including a
refrigerator and a stove.
With the acquisition of the
house, former publishing
headquarters of A ni erican

Anthropologist magazine, the
BSU is presently the only student
organization in the Tresidder
Loft. When asked if the Tresidder
BSU office was still being used,
Scott replied, "We acquired Black
House as an answer to a demand,
meaning that we are not giving up
anything in return."
Scott explained that Black
House is, "operated for the use
and benefit of Black people, and
as a gathering place for Black
thought." It is "open to all Blacks

and to white people with
business." He felt that, "White
people have a tendency to get in
the way" in any large group of
Blacks, and that no one in the
house has time for, "self
appointed liberal Whites" who
wish to patronize them.
