# Speaker Criticizes U.S. Interventions
## 
### 
Speaking to a meeting
sponsored by The Concerned
Faculty on April 23, Richard
Bar net, Co-Director of the
Institute for Policy Studies in
Washington, D.C., attacked
post-war American foreign policy
for its systematic intervention
against revolutionary movements.
Besides being a former official
of the Department of State and
Deputy Director of the Office of
Political Research in the Arms
Control and Disarmament Agency
during the Kennedy
Administration, Larnet is a former
Fellow of the Russian Research
Center at Harvard and the Center
for International Studies at
Princeton.
Most of Barnet's remarks arose
from discussion of his most recent
book, Intervention and
Revolution: The United States in
the Third World. Stating that the
U.S. has intervened against
revolutions or nationalistic
movements once every 18 months
in the post-war period, he cited
Vietnam, the Dominican
Republic, Iran, Guatamala, and
British Guiana as major examples.
Barnet added, however, that of
more significant than these
better-known instances is the
continuing U.S. effort to prevent
the rise of insurgent forces by
means of aid programs, the CIA,
and whole series of economic and
military devices.
Between $40 and $50 billion
of the Department of Defense
budget goes for counter-insur
gency, claimed Barnet. In the
present budget he noted plans for
a CAS plane and fast-deployment
logistics ships to be used in future
Vietnam-like situations.
Asserting that the U.S. is
following a traditionally
imperialist policy, Barnet said that
American companies are
increasingly gaining control of the
resources of underdeveloped
countries. To underscore his
statement, he noted that some
Latin American countries have
smaller GNP's than U.S.
corporations there.
"Those national security
institutions which we support
with about $.80 of our tax dollar
must be changed," remarked Mr.
Barnet. He said that he could see

no other means of altering our
foreign policy.
He th n added that we must
''develop a strategy for
dismantling these institutions.
There is no force in the world
today, I contend, which can
contain the United States. If the
U.S. is to be contained, we must
do it."
A panel discussion with
Professor Bernstein of the History
Department and Steve Weissman
followed Mr. Barnet's speech.

Vietnam, the Dominican
Republic, Iran, Guatamala, and
British Guiana as major examples.
Barnet added, however, that of
more significant than these
better-known instances is the
continuing U.S. effort to prevent
the rise of insurgent forces by
means of aid programs, the CIA,
and whole series of economic and
military devices.
Between $40 and $50 billion
of the Department of Defense
budget goes for counter-insur
gency, claimed Barnet. In the
present budget he noted plans for
a CAS plane and fast-deployment
logistics ships to be used in future
Vietnam-like situations.
Asserting that the U.S. is
following a traditionally
imperialist policy, Barnet said that
American companies are
increasingly gaining control of the
resources of underdeveloped
countries. To underscore his
statement, he noted that some
Latin American countries have
smaller GNP's than U.S.
corporations there.
"Those national security
institutions which we support
with about $.80 of our tax dollar
must be changed," remarked Mr.
Barnet. He said that he could see

no other means of altering our
foreign policy.
He th n added that we must
''develop a strategy for
dismantling these institutions.
There is no force in the world
today, I contend, which can
contain the United States. If the
U.S. is to be contained, we must
do it."
A panel discussion with
Professor Bernstein of the History
Department and Steve Weissman
followed Mr. Barnet's speech.
