# Stanford SDS Meets To Consider A3M Role
## 
### 
At a meeting attended by over one
hundred people the Stanford Students
for a Democratic Society (SDS) last
night discussed how their organization
would and should relate to the April
Third Movement (A3M).
Although a concensus had not been
reached on SDS's relation to the A3M
when The Daily went to press, some
proposals had reached a state of general
agreement. It was agreed that SDS
would continue to maintain its identity
as an organization within the coalition
of groups in the April Third Movement.
This identity, it was felt, could best
be seen in light of the SDS analysis of
U.S. imperialism. Although it was
generally agreed that SDS would not
seek to push its analysis on A3M, the
meeting affirmed its intent to continue
to seek to educate people toward their
views.
It was pointed out that there is little
or no leadership in the April Third
Movement. Lincoln Malik a graduate
student in engineering, from Iraq,

proposed that SDS assume leadership to
insure the continuation of the
movement until A3M developed its own
leaders.
This proposal met with considerable
opposition. David Pugh, an
undergraduate in political science
suggested that "old SDS'ers" step down
to let new leadership and interest
develop.
As the meeting moved out of
Tresidder Union to accomodate the
union's closing hour a compromise
seemed to be forming. It was apparent
that SDS would not attempt to
influence the April Third Movement in
any way other than proposing
suggestions to the coalition.
As to whether or not these
suggestions would be presented by SDS
as a caucus or by individuals as
individuals and members of A3M, the
meeting was undecided. It appeared,
however, that the caucus idea would not
be acceptable.
