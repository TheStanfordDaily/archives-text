# UGLY Meeting Place For Hearing On SRI
## 
### 
A five-man Board of Trustees
committee will hold hearings on
relations between the University and
Stanford Research Institute at 2 p.m.
tomorrow in the Forum Room of Meyer
Library, University Relations Director
Lyle M. Nelson reported yesterday.
The proceedings will be broadcast on
closed circuit TV to Memorial
Auditorium and on campus radio
station KZSU. As many as three trustees
besides those on the committee may
attend the hearings.
Under arrangements previously
announced, the hearings will oepn with
an hour's testimony from SRI officers
and staff members, followed by an hour
and a half of student testimony, which
will be coordinated by the Dean of
Students Office in consultation with the
Associated Students Committee on
Nominations.
Arrangements for an hour's
testimony by about a half dozen faculty
members are being made by the
Academic Secretary in consultation
with the Steering Committee of the
Senate of the Academic Council.
In a letter to the April Third
Movement (A3M), Friday, President
Pitzer indicated the hearing might be
cancelled unless this group provided
assurances by 2 p.m. Tuesday that they
would refrain from interfering with its
order and decorum. The ASM
Coordinating Committee, in response,

reiterated its demand for a meeting of
the entire board Wednesday in a
"suitably large auditorium."
The hearing stems from a March 31
recommendation of students, faculty,
and trustees on the University Advisory
Committee that ''selected
representatives of divergent positions
should be invited to present their views
to the board or to a committee of the
board."
The Senate of the Academic Council
will hold a special meeting at 7:30 p.m.
this evening to consider University-SRI
relations. This is the second meeting
called on this topic.
