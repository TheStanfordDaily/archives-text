# Hits Sit-In Too
## AEL Director Critical Of Senate 
### SUSAN SWARD 
William Rambo is the tall, thin,
red-headed man who directs the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Because of Rambo's position within
the university, his name was often
mentioned by speakers at the recent
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory. Rambo himself went over
to the sit-in several times to talk
informally with members of the April
Third Movement and once to survey the
condition of his occupied office.
A native of the Santa Clara Valley,
Rambo received his undergraduate and
graduate degrees in electronics from
Stanford. During World War 11, he
joined the Harvard staff and wori:cd in a
lab that focused on electronic warfare
research.
After employment with a private
company in New York that worked
with the problems of air traffic control,

Rambo returned to Stanford in 1951.
Today he holds two positions besides
his post as Director of Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Dean and Prof
He is an associate dean for research
in the School of Engineering, and he is a
professor in the department of electrical
engineering.
As an associate dean, Rambo feels
that many individuals have an incorrect
conceptualization of the way the
department of engineering gets its
research contracts. While th? Director of
SEL admit}-' that a "military-industrial
complex" does exist in (he United
States, he resents the phrase
"military-industrial-university < omplex"
because he feels the phrase to be an
inaccurate description of the situation.
According to Rambo, the idea is
simply false that a man who sits on the
Board of Trustees and on the Board of
Directors of Lockheed could pressure
the university into doing the kind of
research he desires.
University Defines
"It is the university that defines the
kind of research it does. The research is
then funded by people in the outside
community who are ■ 'illing to operate
within the university's definition of
research," Rambo said.
Rambo professes to be "quite
disappointed" with the Academic
Senate's decision handed down last
week to cut back on classified research
going on at Stanford.
Of all the member labs within SEL,
the Systems Techniques Laboratory
(STL) was the most profoundly affected
by the Senate's action, Rambo
maintains. While STL's unclassified
programs will still be able to operate, a
large measure of the financial support

for the classified segment of STL's
research will be cut back.
Senate Action
"The Senate action really removed
some features of the STL program that I
felt were quite attractive aspects of
research and most effective additions to
the education opportunities offered our
students," Rambo noted. "Obviously, I
felt they were attractive or they
wouldn't have been in operation for the
last 20 years or so."
Up until the present time, the STL
program has been a focal point of
interest for critical elements within the
community because it focuses more on
applied than basic research, Rambo
observes. Because STL's research is in
electronics techniques, it supports the
development of a technological base
that is of important to "a whole host of
ir i. rsots in the outside community."
Opo : T i .itererf, d agents is clearly
ti;-> Defe lse Department. Rambo states
that as fir as he knows, the Defense
Department is "the largest user in the
country of sophisticated science and
technology."
The Director of SEL has not made
up his mind as to whether or not the
J.-°nate's action is a step toward
.vediocrity in the university. It cannot
l e argued, Rambo feels, that a good
university comes from having no
classified research. Neither can it be
argued that classified research is needed
to make a good university.
Though Rambo is the first to admit
that he is personally biased, he was
opposed to the idea of the sit-in in the
Applied Electronics Building. While the
Dea'i feels that the questions raised by
t!i<> sit-in are completely legitimate and
dcrr.and argument, he questions the
sit-i>. tactic as a method for gaining that
argument.

The Director of SEL points out that
the sit-in was not a cost-free venture in
that it cost the university more than
$100,000. A student could calculate
this loss in terms of loss of fellowship
money, and a faculty member could
calculate the loss in terms of his
contributions to the Martin Luther King
Fund.
Rambo also questions the "selective
disclosure" of documents taken from
nis desk during the sit-in.
"I don't like to sound defensive, but
there was one letter taken from my desk
that received no mention. It was a letter
from a House of Representatives
Congressman, Jeffrey Cohelan, thanking
me for expressing my opinion to him
against the ABM missile system and for
my support of a moratorium on arms
escalation," Rambo said.
The Dean's criticism of the sit-in is
part and parcel of his iiroader focus on
the role of Stanford in the society at
large. Rambo objects to tiie sit-in as the
manifestation of a force attempting to
bring the university to a consensus
position.
The university's ability to harbor
diversities is an essential ability, Rambo
contends. The university is not a
politically neutral institution because it
does harbor this diversity, but
historically institution itself has
taken a neutral political position as
offering the be--t base of operation.
When queslioned about whether or
not student anti faculty criticism of the
SEL's activities have affected him,
Ram bo's freckled Tace took on a
bemused grin.
"Sure," he said. He recalled an
altered picture which the Peninsula
Observer ran that portrayed him
directing Vietnam bombing raids. "You
can't be unaffected by that," he said.

Though Rambo is the first to admit
that he is personally biased, he was
opposed to the idea of the sit-in in the
Applied Electronics Building. While the
Dea'i feels that the questions raised by
t!i<> sit-in are completely legitimate and
dcrr.and argument, he questions the
sit-i>. tactic as a method for gaining that
argument.

The Director of SEL points out that
the sit-in was not a cost-free venture in
that it cost the university more than
$100,000. A student could calculate
this loss in terms of loss of fellowship
money, and a faculty member could
calculate the loss in terms of his
contributions to the Martin Luther King
Fund.
Rambo also questions the "selective
disclosure" of documents taken from
nis desk during the sit-in.
"I don't like to sound defensive, but
there was one letter taken from my desk
that received no mention. It was a letter
from a House of Representatives
Congressman, Jeffrey Cohelan, thanking
me for expressing my opinion to him
against the ABM missile system and for
my support of a moratorium on arms
escalation," Rambo said.
The Dean's criticism of the sit-in is
part and parcel of his iiroader focus on
the role of Stanford in the society at
large. Rambo objects to tiie sit-in as the
manifestation of a force attempting to
bring the university to a consensus
position.
The university's ability to harbor
diversities is an essential ability, Rambo
contends. The university is not a
politically neutral institution because it
does harbor this diversity, but
historically institution itself has
taken a neutral political position as
offering the be--t base of operation.
When queslioned about whether or

Ram bo's freckled Tace took on a

"Sure," he said. He recalled an

Observer ran that portrayed him
directing Vietnam bombing raids. "You
can't be unaffected by that," he said.
William Rambo is the tall, thin,
red-headed man who directs the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Because of Rambo's position within
the university, his name was often
mentioned by speakers at the recent
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory. Rambo himself went over
to the sit-in several times to talk
informally with members of the April
Third Movement and once to survey the
condition of his occupied office.
A native of the Santa Clara Valley,
Rambo received his undergraduate and
graduate degrees in electronics from
Stanford. During World War 11, he
joined the Harvard staff and wori:cd in a
lab that focused on electronic warfare
research.
After employment with a private
company in New York that worked
with the problems of air traffic control,

Rambo returned to Stanford in 1951.
Today he holds two positions besides
his post as Director of Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Dean and Prof
He is an associate dean for research
in the School of Engineering, and he is a
professor in the department of electrical
engineering.
As an associate dean, Rambo feels
that many individuals have an incorrect
conceptualization of the way the
department of engineering gets its
research contracts. While th? Director of
SEL admit}-' that a "military-industrial
complex" does exist in (he United
States, he resents the phrase
"military-industrial-university < omplex"
because he feels the phrase to be an
inaccurate description of the situation.
According to Rambo, the idea is
simply false that a man who sits on the
Board of Trustees and on the Board of
Directors of Lockheed could pressure
the university into doing the kind of
research he desires.
University Defines
"It is the university that defines the
kind of research it does. The research is
then funded by people in the outside
community who are ■ 'illing to operate
within the university's definition of
research," Rambo said.
Rambo professes to be "quite
disappointed" with the Academic
Senate's decision handed down last
week to cut back on classified research
going on at Stanford.
Of all the member labs within SEL,
the Systems Techniques Laboratory
(STL) was the most profoundly affected
by the Senate's action, Rambo
maintains. While STL's unclassified
programs will still be able to operate, a
large measure of the financial support

for the classified segment of STL's
research will be cut back.
Senate Action
"The Senate action really removed
some features of the STL program that I
felt were quite attractive aspects of
research and most effective additions to
the education opportunities offered our
students," Rambo noted. "Obviously, I
felt they were attractive or they
wouldn't have been in operation for the
last 20 years or so."
Up until the present time, the STL
program has been a focal point of
interest for critical elements within the
community because it focuses more on
applied than basic research, Rambo
observes. Because STL's research is in
electronics techniques, it supports the
development of a technological base
that is of important to "a whole host of
ir i. rsots in the outside community."

inaccurate description of the situation.
According to Rambo, the idea is
simply false that a man who sits on the
Board of Trustees and on the Board of
Directors of Lockheed could pressure
the university into doing the kind of
research he desires.
University Defines
"It is the university that defines the
kind of research it does. The research is
then funded by people in the outside
community who are ■ 'illing to operate
within the university's definition of
research," Rambo said.
Rambo professes to be "quite
disappointed" with the Academic
Senate's decision handed down last
week to cut back on classified research
going on at Stanford.
Of all the member labs within SEL,
the Systems Techniques Laboratory
(STL) was the most profoundly affected
by the Senate's action, Rambo
maintains. While STL's unclassified
programs will still be able to operate, a
large measure of the financial support

for the classified segment of STL's
research will be cut back.
Senate Action
"The Senate action really removed
some features of the STL program that I
felt were quite attractive aspects of
research and most effective additions to
the education opportunities offered our
students," Rambo noted. "Obviously, I
felt they were attractive or they
wouldn't have been in operation for the
last 20 years or so."
Up until the present time, the STL
program has been a focal point of
interest for critical elements within the
community because it focuses more on
applied than basic research, Rambo
observes. Because STL's research is in
electronics techniques, it supports the
development of a technological base
that is of important to "a whole host of
ir i. rsots in the outside community."
Opo : T i .itererf, d agents is clearly
ti;-> Defe lse Department. Rambo states
that as fir as he knows, the Defense
Department is "the largest user in the
country of sophisticated science and
technology."
The Director of SEL has not made
up his mind as to whether or not the
J.-°nate's action is a step toward
.vediocrity in the university. It cannot
l e argued, Rambo feels, that a good
university comes from having no
classified research. Neither can it be
argued that classified research is needed
to make a good university.
Though Rambo is the first to admit
that he is personally biased, he was
opposed to the idea of the sit-in in the
Applied Electronics Building. While the
Dea'i feels that the questions raised by
t!i<> sit-in are completely legitimate and
dcrr.and argument, he questions the
sit-i>. tactic as a method for gaining that
argument.

The Director of SEL points out that
the sit-in was not a cost-free venture in
that it cost the university more than
$100,000. A student could calculate
this loss in terms of loss of fellowship
money, and a faculty member could
calculate the loss in terms of his
contributions to the Martin Luther King
Fund.
Rambo also questions the "selective
disclosure" of documents taken from
nis desk during the sit-in.
"I don't like to sound defensive, but
there was one letter taken from my desk
that received no mention. It was a letter
from a House of Representatives
Congressman, Jeffrey Cohelan, thanking
me for expressing my opinion to him
against the ABM missile system and for
my support of a moratorium on arms
escalation," Rambo said.
The Dean's criticism of the sit-in is
part and parcel of his iiroader focus on
the role of Stanford in the society at
large. Rambo objects to tiie sit-in as the
manifestation of a force attempting to
bring the university to a consensus
position.
The university's ability to harbor
diversities is an essential ability, Rambo
contends. The university is not a
politically neutral institution because it
does harbor this diversity, but
historically institution itself has
taken a neutral political position as
offering the be--t base of operation.
When queslioned about whether or
not student anti faculty criticism of the
SEL's activities have affected him,
Ram bo's freckled Tace took on a
bemused grin.
"Sure," he said. He recalled an
altered picture which the Peninsula
Observer ran that portrayed him
directing Vietnam bombing raids. "You
can't be unaffected by that," he said.
William Rambo is the tall, thin,
red-headed man who directs the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Because of Rambo's position within
the university, his name was often
mentioned by speakers at the recent
sit-in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory. Rambo himself went over
to the sit-in several times to talk
informally with members of the April
Third Movement and once to survey the
condition of his occupied office.
A native of the Santa Clara Valley,
Rambo received his undergraduate and
graduate degrees in electronics from
Stanford. During World War 11, he
joined the Harvard staff and wori:cd in a
lab that focused on electronic warfare
research.
After employment with a private
company in New York that worked
with the problems of air traffic control,

Rambo returned to Stanford in 1951.
Today he holds two positions besides
his post as Director of Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL).
Dean and Prof
He is an associate dean for research
in the School of Engineering, and he is a
professor in the department of electrical
engineering.
As an associate dean, Rambo feels
that many individuals have an incorrect
conceptualization of the way the
department of engineering gets its
research contracts. While th? Director of
SEL admit}-' that a "military-industrial
complex" does exist in (he United
States, he resents the phrase
"military-industrial-university < omplex"
because he feels the phrase to be an
inaccurate description of the situation.
