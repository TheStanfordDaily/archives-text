# Stern Suicide
## 
### 
Carl Woosloy Jr., a 21 year old junior
in psychology, died in Cowell Health
Center yesterday afternoon, an apparent
suicide, minutes after his arrival.
Students found Woosley in his room
in Serra House, Stern Hall, shortly after
lunch. He was surrounded by empty
medicine bottles which held cold tablets
and tranquilizers.
A note which contained a reference
to the "pain of existence" was found
near Woosley and has been taken to the
Santa Clara County Coroner's office.
Woosley, a new student in Stern this
quarter, was chairman of his house's
social committee. He was the son of Mr.
and Mrs. Carl Woosley of Pine Bluff,
Arkansas.
