# Faculty, Students Split On SRI
## 
### 
Two-thirds of the student body (68.2
per cent) and one-third of the faculty
(35.6 per cent) fjvor bringing Stanford
Research Institute under closer
University control, with a community
committee redirecting its research
activities, according to a poll of faculty
and students released yesterday.
But more than half the faculty ( >3.3
per cent) favor sale of SRI under certain
conditionsâ€”a position held by les 1 ; than
one-fifth of the students per
cent). Only nine per cent of the faculty
(and twelve per cent of the students)
favor continuation of the present
SRI-University relationship.
More than 78 per cent of the
students (and 61 per cent of the
faculty) picked first choice options that
included placing some restraints on
SRl's research.
A clear majority of students oppose
counter-insurgency studies and research
related to the war in Southeast Asia at
SRI, and faculty opposition to these
kinds of research also is very
widespread.
These findings highlight separate mail
polls covering Stanford students and
faculty, conducted and released by a
student-faculty committee headed by
communications professor, Nathan
Maccoby. Respondents included 5,671
of the 12,775 students enrolled at
Stanford during the past three quarters
(44% response) and 671 of the 1,22-4
faculty members receiving
questionnaires (55% response).
The April Third Movement, v/hicr
conducted a nine-day sit-in at the
Applied Electronics Laboratory, has
strongly backed closer integration of
SRI into the University.
Committee Report
Nine members of a 12-man
s t u d en t-facul ty committee on
University-SRI relations recommended
its sale, with seven saying this should be
done with covenant restrictions on
certain kinds of hers. The
overwhelming of SRl's

1,500-man professional staff would
walk out rather thin submit to controls
imposed on tiieir research by an outside
committee, accordhvj to SRI President
Charles A. Andorso 1.
The campus poll was suggested by a
student-faculty-trustee committee to
help provide a broad cross-section of
opinion before the board decides what
changes, if any, to make in the present
relationship.
Almost half the faculty said they
would favor restricting
counter- insurgency studies, research
related to the war in Southeast Asia and
classified work if SRI were more closely
integrated with the University. If SRI
were sold, the faculty respondents
indicated by a narrow margin that they
would not favor these kinds of
restraints.
SRI has two i< -(classified CBW
contracts, represent' .g a backlog of
about $50,00 C by the
Edgewood Arsenal. At the request of
the Stanford trustees directors and
officers of SRI have imposed a
temporary 'Moratorium on any new
contracts in i i.emical-biological warfare.
CBW .cstrictions Favored
A majority of the '"acuity said they
wouia favor the restriction of
chemical-biological and radiological
warfare research, even if SRI were sold.
When asked to rank the three most
important issues concerning SRI to
them personally, students gave top
priority to redirecting its research
activities, either by restricting certain
kinds of research or by encouraging
others. Integration with the University
ranked third.
Among facuky, separating SRI from
the University Was the most frequent
first choice, wito redirection of research
ranking second and third in importance.
One in 10 acuity felt maximizing
the increase ii University financial
resources was ti e most important issue,
a view held by * lly four percent of the
students.
