## Coffin Empathizes With Youth 
### DAN BERNSTEIN 
If he was a CIA agent, he'd be
picketed; if he was just a Chaplain, he'd
be politely listened to; but former CIA
agent, Chaplain William Sloane Coffin
of Yale, is a sincerely concerned man—a
man who cares about and sympathizes
with the young people of America, and
because of this he joins the elite echelon
of those over thirty who can still draw a
large, youthful audience.
Coffin, who was convicted of a
conspiracy charge with Dr. Benjamin
Spock and three others in the notorious
Boston Five trial, came to Stanford last
weekend, and reflected upon the
tensions which grip universities today.
Today's students, by refusing to
accept seemingly unquestionable
definitions, "act out in public a Socratic
WHY" but do so "in a downright
incompetent way."
Coffin, a man with a vast reservoir of
knowledge quoted Nobel Laureate

George Wald who said, "Student unrest
continues because there's so little adult
unrest."
Coffin, although quick to deplore
what he calls "mindless militancy," was
no less reluctant to chastize the power
structure for being those "bound to
custom and who define reality as the
status-quo." Coffin went on to say that
members of this establishment are
"dedicated to the status quo, and in
such a state righteousness is not

relevant."
As he leaned back on his unmade bed
in the Wilbur guest room and flopped
his stocking feet over the edge, Coffin
turned his attention to "the system."
I'm not sure that occupying a building is
not going through the system. But you
should make it clear to others what
you're trying to accomplish."
"It's bad when you're more loyal to
the system than to the people that the
system was designed to serve," he
continued, "and I look at the
Stanford situation as a chance for
all to rise above their previous
conceptions to attain a new
community."
Coffin concluded in his
uncannily quotable style that "It
is only through the achievement
of this community that you can
have authority with overtones of
legitimacy as opposed to power
with overtones of nakedness."
Sunday's Sermon
In the sermon he delivered last
Sunday at Memorial Church,
Coffin cited the emergence of
individuality over custom's
dictated conformity in referring
to the concept of Black is
beautiful, the white youth's
expression with hair, and even the
new styles of dress that some
women have adopted.
But even as he acknowledged
these new innovations, Coffin
noted that when up against
custom, these movements result in
insurrection. He also pointed out
that a possible companion of
insurrecti on—violence—was
condemned by Christ because
"When you physically threaten
another man you are no longer his
equal."
Conceding that violence would
bring about change, Coffin
emphasized that Christ never
advocated it because "violence
merely changes the world into a
more violent world."
