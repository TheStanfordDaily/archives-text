# SRI Hearing Set; Movement To Meet
## 
### 
The IJoard of Trustees went ahead with plans
fur a restricted hearing on SRI thisafternoon, while
the April 3rd Movement called a community
meeting at noon today in the Old Union courtyard
to decide on a response.
Last night the Academic Senate debated the
SRI issue tor five hours, but took no final action.
(See story below.)
Yesterday afternoon, the Movement delivered
petitions to President Kenneth Pitzer with 3500
signatures demanding that the hearing be trans
formed into an open meeting of the entire board.
(See story below.)
The SRI hearing will begin at 2 p.m. in the
forum room of Meyer Library. Five trustees will sit
as a committee and hear testimony for four hours
from SRI management, live faculty, and 12
selected students.
The proceedings will be broadcast by closed
circuit TV onto a 50-foot screen in Memorial
Auditorium. KZSU Radio will also broadcast the
hearing.
In a flurry of meetings yesterday, Pitzer con
sulted his Committee on Campus Disruptions and
other advisors before deciding to go ahead with the
hearing. Pitzer had warned tne April 3rd Movement
last Friday that he would cancel the hearing if he

did not receive assurances tnat the Movement
would not disrupt its "order and decorum."
In other developments, an angry group of
engineering faculty and staff set up a 24-hour
guard on the new Space Engineering building, to
head off a sit-in. The building has been frequently
mentioned by the Movement as a possible site for a
luture demonstration. (See story below.)
In a three hour meeting last night in Tresidder,
200 members of the Movement debated tactics for
a response to the closed SRI hearing, but decided
to put off a decision at least until the noon
meeting today. The meeting had an atmosphere of
confidence and determination.
The closed hearing tomorrow will be conducted
by five Trustees: Morris Doyle, Richard Guggen
hime, Ben Duniway, Mrs. Allan Charles, and
William Hewlett, who was added late yesterday to
replace Robert M. Brown. Three other trustees, W.
Parmer Fuller, Mrs. Jesse Nichols, and Dean
Watkins, will sit in the audience.

from five SRI executives, headed by SRI President
Charles Anderson. For the next hour and a half, 1 2
students will speak in turn. Five faculty will testify

WHAT NOW?-April 3 Movement discusses plans.
The IJoard of Trustees went ahead with plans
fur a restricted hearing on SRI thisafternoon, while
the April 3rd Movement called a community
meeting at noon today in the Old Union courtyard
to decide on a response.
Last night the Academic Senate debated the
SRI issue tor five hours, but took no final action.
(See story below.)
Yesterday afternoon, the Movement delivered
petitions to President Kenneth Pitzer with 3500
signatures demanding that the hearing be trans
formed into an open meeting of the entire board.
(See story below.)
The SRI hearing will begin at 2 p.m. in the
forum room of Meyer Library. Five trustees will sit
as a committee and hear testimony for four hours
from SRI management, live faculty, and 12
selected students.
The proceedings will be broadcast by closed
circuit TV onto a 50-foot screen in Memorial
Auditorium. KZSU Radio will also broadcast the
hearing.
In a flurry of meetings yesterday, Pitzer con
sulted his Committee on Campus Disruptions and
other advisors before deciding to go ahead with the
hearing. Pitzer had warned tne April 3rd Movement
last Friday that he would cancel the hearing if he

did not receive assurances tnat the Movement
would not disrupt its "order and decorum."
In other developments, an angry group of
engineering faculty and staff set up a 24-hour
guard on the new Space Engineering building, to
head off a sit-in. The building has been frequently
mentioned by the Movement as a possible site for a
luture demonstration. (See story below.)
In a three hour meeting last night in Tresidder,
200 members of the Movement debated tactics for
a response to the closed SRI hearing, but decided
to put off a decision at least until the noon
meeting today. The meeting had an atmosphere of
confidence and determination.
The closed hearing tomorrow will be conducted
by five Trustees: Morris Doyle, Richard Guggen
