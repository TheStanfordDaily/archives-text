## Stanford Waits For The Trustees 
### David Pugh 
It's been almost a month since
the April 3 Movement demanded
that Stanford and SRI cease their
war-related and classified research.
Almost all of that research
continues today.
We haven't heard anything
from the Stanford trustees yet,
which is little short of incredible,
or very understandable, depending
on what you expect from the men
who spend most of their time
running the huge corporations
that dominate the American and
"free world" political economy.
But we do have a fair idea of
the extent of our strength here at
Stanford and at SRI. On top of
the 1300 students and faculty
who signed the AEL Solidarity
Statement, we must weigh the
results of the most recent in this
spring's string of referenda.
Forty-seven percent of the faculty
and 77 percent of the student
respondents found it "acceptable"
to retain and control SRI. Well
over half of the students and just
under 50 percent of the faculty
voted to end counterinsurgency,
Southeast Asian war-related, and
classified publications research.
Approximately 20 percent of the
students and faculty are either
neutral or undecided in these
areas.
Though the results of the

referendum are a bit heady, it
would be a serious mistake to base
the legitimacy of the A3M
demands on a Stanford handcount
instead of on an ethical and
political stance that emphasizes
the right of every people to
self-determination. In the area of
counterinsurgency research, for
example, the legitimate
decision-making communities are
either in the Third World or in our
urban colonies. The referendum
thus indicates that a majority of
the Stanford community has
decided that the research facilities
of Stanford and SRI should not
be used to deny the basic right of
self-determination to effectively
colonized peoples both at home
and abroad.
Staff Not Happy
Though SRI has developed
very sharp, internal political
divisions, it is clear that the vast
majority of the staff is not happy
with any of the proposals laid out
in the Scott Report. Few of them
want to work for Lockheed,
Litton, or some other
conglomerate that might buy SRI.
Fewer still would stay on at SRI if
(he university allowed SRI to
"buy itself from Stanford" at the
rate of $2 million a year. This is
just the amount SRI now has for
exploratory, non-mission oriented

research, just the research we
might want to encourage.
The people who work at SRI
will be the first to tell us that the
university must either let the
Institute go its own way without a
restrictive covenant (a solution
which would make a growing
number of the staff feel uneasy),
or bring an SRI minus war
research closer to the university.
Some of the most creative and
socially concerned researchers at
SRI would accept the latter
alternative, but only if the
university were willing to make a
medium-size short term loan to
the Institute in order to tide it
over the period of transition from
war research to peace research.
Stanford would also have to
devote more of its fund-raising
energy to finding funds for
socially constructive applied
research at both Stanford and
SRI. Still smarting from the Scott
Report, SRI people would
certainly want to participate
heavily in the work of any new
committee set up to work out an
operational plan for bringing
Jtanford and the Institute closer.
President Pitzer is desperately
trying to scapegoat the April 3
Movement by threatening to call
off today's barely-open hearings if
he doesn't get an assurance that

"order and decorum" will be
maintained. If Pitzer were actively
pushing for a meeting of the full
board, open to the whole
Stanford-SRI community, we
might be more ready to believe
that Pitzer's concern with order
and good manners is not just a
diversionary tactic.
But what about the trustees
themselves? After a month of
arrogant silence, five trustees have
finally come to collect selected
"student-faculty-SRI input."
It is important to understand
that the 5-trustee panel is not
even close to being representative
of the full board. None of the five
(corporate lawyers Doyle, Brown,
Guggenheim; lawyer's wife Mrs.
Charles; judge Duniway) derive
their power and wealth directly
from corporations based on war
production or expansion into the
Third World. All but SRI board
chairman Doyle are liberals, as the
Stanford board goes.
Preview
If the creampuff trustees
decide to answer questions from
the floor about SRl's research, as
some of their fellow trustees did
on March 11, we should get a
preview of what we can expect
from the full board this spring.

If all five trustees do not
support ending SRl's CBW,
cou nteri nsurgency, Southeast
Asian war-related, and classified
research and forming a
community research review board
to apply these guidelines; if they
do not support setting up a
community committee charged
with developing an operational
plan for bringing a greatly
weakened SRI into a new,
productive relationship with
Stanford as well as releasing some
of the university's resources to
make this possible, it is
inconceivable that the full board
will.
So here it is, April 30.
Midterms are coming up. The sun
shines hotter and drains us of our
energy. Stanford normally studies
and sunbathes at this time of the
year. But something has happened
this spring.
More than a few of us have the
strong feeling that time is running
out for the Stanford trustees and
for research that stunts and
eliminates human life in the name
of a paranoid anti-Communism
and a very coolly planned
economic empire.

university were willing to make a
medium-size short term loan to
the Institute in order to tide it
over the period of transition from
war research to peace research.
Stanford would also have to
devote more of its fund-raising
energy to finding funds for
socially constructive applied
research at both Stanford and
SRI. Still smarting from the Scott

certainly want to participate

President Pitzer is desperately
trying to scapegoat the April 3
Movement by threatening to call
off today's barely-open hearings if
he doesn't get an assurance that

"order and decorum" will be
maintained. If Pitzer were actively
pushing for a meeting of the full
board, open to the whole
Stanford-SRI community, we
might be more ready to believe
that Pitzer's concern with order
and good manners is not just a
diversionary tactic.
But what about the trustees
themselves? After a month of
arrogant silence, five trustees have
finally come to collect selected
"student-faculty-SRI input."
It is important to understand
that the 5-trustee panel is not
even close to being representative
of the full board. None of the five
(corporate lawyers Doyle, Brown,
Guggenheim; lawyer's wife Mrs.
Charles; judge Duniway) derive
their power and wealth directly
from corporations based on war
production or expansion into the
Third World. All but SRI board
chairman Doyle are liberals, as the
Stanford board goes.
Preview
If the creampuff trustees
decide to answer questions from
the floor about SRl's research, as
some of their fellow trustees did
on March 11, we should get a
preview of what we can expect
from the full board this spring.

If all five trustees do not
support ending SRl's CBW,
cou nteri nsurgency, Southeast
Asian war-related, and classified
research and forming a
community research review board
to apply these guidelines; if they
do not support setting up a
community committee charged
with developing an operational
plan for bringing a greatly
weakened SRI into a new,
productive relationship with
Stanford as well as releasing some
of the university's resources to
make this possible, it is
inconceivable that the full board
will.
So here it is, April 30.
Midterms are coming up. The sun
shines hotter and drains us of our
energy. Stanford normally studies
and sunbathes at this time of the
year. But something has happened
this spring.
More than a few of us have the
strong feeling that time is running
out for the Stanford trustees and
for research that stunts and
eliminates human life in the name
of a paranoid anti-Communism
and a very coolly planned
economic empire.
(David I'ngli is a member of the
SOS and April 3rd
Movement-Ed.)
It's been almost a month since
the April 3 Movement demanded
that Stanford and SRI cease their
war-related and classified research.
Almost all of that research
continues today.
We haven't heard anything
from the Stanford trustees yet,
which is little short of incredible,
or very understandable, depending
on what you expect from the men
who spend most of their time
running the huge corporations
that dominate the American and
"free world" political economy.
But we do have a fair idea of
the extent of our strength here at
Stanford and at SRI. On top of
the 1300 students and faculty
who signed the AEL Solidarity
Statement, we must weigh the
results of the most recent in this
spring's string of referenda.
Forty-seven percent of the faculty
and 77 percent of the student
respondents found it "acceptable"
to retain and control SRI. Well
over half of the students and just
under 50 percent of the faculty
voted to end counterinsurgency,
Southeast Asian war-related, and
classified publications research.
Approximately 20 percent of the
students and faculty are either
neutral or undecided in these
areas.
Though the results of the

referendum are a bit heady, it
would be a serious mistake to base
the legitimacy of the A3M
demands on a Stanford handcount
instead of on an ethical and
political stance that emphasizes
the right of every people to
self-determination. In the area of
counterinsurgency research, for
example, the legitimate
decision-making communities are
either in the Third World or in our
urban colonies. The referendum
thus indicates that a majority of
the Stanford community has
decided that the research facilities
of Stanford and SRI should not
be used to deny the basic right of
self-determination to effectively
colonized peoples both at home
and abroad.
Staff Not Happy
Though SRI has developed
very sharp, internal political
divisions, it is clear that the vast
majority of the staff is not happy
with any of the proposals laid out
in the Scott Report. Few of them
want to work for Lockheed,
Litton, or some other
conglomerate that might buy SRI.
Fewer still would stay on at SRI if
(he university allowed SRI to
"buy itself from Stanford" at the
rate of $2 million a year. This is
just the amount SRI now has for
exploratory, non-mission oriented

research, just the research we
might want to encourage.
The people who work at SRI
will be the first to tell us that the
university must either let the
Institute go its own way without a
restrictive covenant (a solution
which would make a growing
number of the staff feel uneasy),
or bring an SRI minus war
research closer to the university.
Some of the most creative and
socially concerned researchers at
SRI would accept the latter
alternative, but only if the
university were willing to make a
medium-size short term loan to
the Institute in order to tide it
over the period of transition from
war research to peace research.
Stanford would also have to

economic empire.
(David I'ngli is a member of the
SOS and April 3rd
Movement-Ed.)
It's been almost a month since
the April 3 Movement demanded
that Stanford and SRI cease their
war-related and classified research.
Almost all of that research
continues today.
We haven't heard anything
from the Stanford trustees yet,
which is little short of incredible,
or very understandable, depending
on what you expect from the men
who spend most of their time
running the huge corporations
that dominate the American and
"free world" political economy.
But we do have a fair idea of
the extent of our strength here at
Stanford and at SRI. On top of
the 1300 students and faculty
who signed the AEL Solidarity
Statement, we must weigh the
results of the most recent in this
spring's string of referenda.
Forty-seven percent of the faculty
and 77 percent of the student
respondents found it "acceptable"
to retain and control SRI. Well
over half of the students and just
under 50 percent of the faculty
voted to end counterinsurgency,
Southeast Asian war-related, and
classified publications research.
Approximately 20 percent of the
students and faculty are either
neutral or undecided in these
areas.
Though the results of the

referendum are a bit heady, it
would be a serious mistake to base
the legitimacy of the A3M
demands on a Stanford handcount
instead of on an ethical and
political stance that emphasizes
the right of every people to
self-determination. In the area of
counterinsurgency research, for
example, the legitimate
decision-making communities are
either in the Third World or in our
urban colonies. The referendum
thus indicates that a majority of
the Stanford community has
decided that the research facilities
of Stanford and SRI should not
be used to deny the basic right of
self-determination to effectively
colonized peoples both at home
and abroad.
Staff Not Happy
Though SRI has developed
very sharp, internal political
divisions, it is clear that the vast
majority of the staff is not happy
with any of the proposals laid out
in the Scott Report. Few of them
want to work for Lockheed,
Litton, or some other
conglomerate that might buy SRI.
Fewer still would stay on at SRI if
(he university allowed SRI to
"buy itself from Stanford" at the
rate of $2 million a year. This is
just the amount SRI now has for
exploratory, non-mission oriented

research, just the research we
might want to encourage.
The people who work at SRI
will be the first to tell us that the
university must either let the
Institute go its own way without a
restrictive covenant (a solution
which would make a growing
number of the staff feel uneasy),
or bring an SRI minus war
research closer to the university.
Some of the most creative and
socially concerned researchers at
SRI would accept the latter
alternative, but only if the
university were willing to make a
medium-size short term loan to
the Institute in order to tide it
over the period of transition from
war research to peace research.
Stanford would also have to
devote more of its fund-raising
energy to finding funds for
socially constructive applied
research at both Stanford and
SRI. Still smarting from the Scott
Report, SRI people would
certainly want to participate
heavily in the work of any new
committee set up to work out an
operational plan for bringing
Jtanford and the Institute closer.
President Pitzer is desperately
trying to scapegoat the April 3
Movement by threatening to call
off today's barely-open hearings if
he doesn't get an assurance that

"order and decorum" will be
maintained. If Pitzer were actively
pushing for a meeting of the full
board, open to the whole
Stanford-SRI community, we
might be more ready to believe
that Pitzer's concern with order
and good manners is not just a
diversionary tactic.
But what about the trustees
themselves? After a month of
arrogant silence, five trustees have
finally come to collect selected
"student-faculty-SRI input."
It is important to understand
that the 5-trustee panel is not
even close to being representative
of the full board. None of the five
(corporate lawyers Doyle, Brown,
Guggenheim; lawyer's wife Mrs.
Charles; judge Duniway) derive
their power and wealth directly
from corporations based on war
production or expansion into the
Third World. All but SRI board
chairman Doyle are liberals, as the
Stanford board goes.
Preview
If the creampuff trustees
decide to answer questions from
the floor about SRl's research, as
some of their fellow trustees did
on March 11, we should get a
preview of what we can expect
from the full board this spring.

If all five trustees do not
support ending SRl's CBW,
cou nteri nsurgency, Southeast
Asian war-related, and classified
research and forming a
community research review board
to apply these guidelines; if they
do not support setting up a
community committee charged
with developing an operational
plan for bringing a greatly
weakened SRI into a new,
productive relationship with
Stanford as well as releasing some
of the university's resources to
make this possible, it is
inconceivable that the full board
will.
So here it is, April 30.
Midterms are coming up. The sun
shines hotter and drains us of our
energy. Stanford normally studies
and sunbathes at this time of the
year. But something has happened
this spring.
More than a few of us have the
strong feeling that time is running
out for the Stanford trustees and
for research that stunts and
eliminates human life in the name
of a paranoid anti-Communism
and a very coolly planned
economic empire.
