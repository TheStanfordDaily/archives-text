# The 						Music Scene
## 
### PETER THOMPSON 
Yeah, well, life can be okay
sometimes. . .like when you can
listen to Dorothy Marrison and
the Northern California State
Youth Choir singing "Oh Happy
Day"and all those other nice
things on their album. I'm sure
this will remain overplayed and
we'll have to hear a lot of hype
about gospel-rock or some, such
nonsense; but all that can be
easily avoided, and powerful
music, masterfully arranged and
produced, is the reward.
And the music has been just
fine throughout the winter, if you
forgot all the bullshit that is
becoming such f .n integral part of
the rock scene. Janis and Grace
are still written up everywhere,
but Tracy Nelson, the chick with
Mother Earth, shouldn't be
overlooked. She might lack the
balls of Janis or the ethereal
harmonies of Grace, but she has
qualities of both that often prove
far more satisfying. The band
keeps changing personnel, but
they were a dynamic lot when
appearing at the Matrix, a
delightful spot on Fillmore near
Lombard, which has also recently
featured Jorma Kaukonen and
Jack Casady (Unaccompanied)
and Elvin Bishop's band.
Kaukonen and Casady are
absolutely supreme in this sort of
interplay and their forthcoming
album should be incredible.
Bishop's crew has the character of
the Matrix itself: not all that
classy, but fun and quite lovable.
Country Joe and the Fish gave
a nostalgic ''farewell''
performance, full of warmth in
the collective remembrance of
things that were and sadness over
that which will never be. Then Joe
and Barry recently surfaced with a
new group, made up of ex-Big
Brother members Albin and Getz
(on bass and drums) and a tasty
country-oriented keyboard man.
They're back into carefree,
relaxed music, and "There I Go
Again" is one of the nicer songs to
emerge of late.
Two groups from England,
Pentangle and Jethro Tull,
transcended all the garbage.
Pentangle blends the twin acoustic
guitars of Bert Jansch and John
Renbourn with a double bass and
the other wordly vocals of Hacqui
McShee; the results just turn your
head right around. Like many
groups, they cannot be strictly
defined, and draw from folk, jazz,
blues, and classical music. Jansch
and Renbourn are too much.
Jethro Tull is the answer to all
of us who are looking for good
jazz and good rock played
together . . .1 mean like Traffic,
and none of the silly jazz-rock
Columbia promotion stuff. Lan
Anderson plays beautiful
jazz-influenced things on flute and
harmonica, Glenn Cornick lays
down your basic rock bass, and
guitarist Mick Abrahams weaves
back and forth between them.
Anderson is a versatile singer, and
the band really moves you . . .as
well as being a wonderfully
bizarre visual trip.

A zenith of sorts was reached
at Grace Catherdral's
"Sensorium" last January. If you
were there, you know; if not, I
can't begin to tell you. A
thousand or so speakers, full of
cricket sounds, loon calls, Steve
Miller, and the Catherdral
organ . . .a couple thousand
people (as flowers, the moon,
water, love,etc.) moving in
processions of ritual . . .dozens of
light sources filling the building
with slides and colors of beauty
and life and that sort of
thing . . .you get the idea. We
really are all one, you know.
For a comparably moving
experience, something like the
music of Smoke is required.
They're another of those beautiful
entities which refuse to be picked
apart. A review will come later,
but, for now, go listen. At once.
The musicians are totally
sympathetic with each other and
with the direction of the whole.
They are: Kenny Washington on
sax, steel drum, maracas; Fred
Barry on trumpet and various
rhythm instruments; Woody Wedd
on vibes and piano; Chris Christy
on bass; and John Felder on
drums. That's all you really need
to know. Their music, simply, is
just a whole lot better than more
things being done these days.
Other noteworthy
appearances: the Byrds, who I
guess will thankfully always be
the Byrds; Mike Bloomfield and
his friends, free of the
SuperSchlockSession crap, and
back into joyfully mellow things;
Chuck Berry who, even when
backed by incompetents like the
Initial Schock, always reminds us
once again what it's really all
about.
And Bob Dylan's album.
And, of course, the Grateful
Dead, perennial winners of the
Livin' is East award, who need no
further embellishment here. Their
live album, not relased until June,
but currently being previewed on
KSAN, will give you some idea of
what San Francisco has been like.
It is probably the finest American
album ever made.
There have been a few
disappointments amidst all these
goodies, but I'll save the Things
We Should Have Avoided
department until later. Forget
about it and go listen to Smoke.

appearing at the Matrix, a
delightful spot on Fillmore near
Lombard, which has also recently
featured Jorma Kaukonen and
Jack Casady (Unaccompanied)
and Elvin Bishop's band.
Kaukonen and Casady are
absolutely supreme in this sort of
interplay and their forthcoming
album should be incredible.
Bishop's crew has the character of
the Matrix itself: not all that
classy, but fun and quite lovable.
Country Joe and the Fish gave
a nostalgic ''farewell''
performance, full of warmth in
the collective remembrance of
things that were and sadness over
that which will never be. Then Joe
and Barry recently surfaced with a
new group, made up of ex-Big
Brother members Albin and Getz
(on bass and drums) and a tasty
country-oriented keyboard man.
They're back into carefree,
relaxed music, and "There I Go
Again" is one of the nicer songs to
emerge of late.
Two groups from England,
Pentangle and Jethro Tull,
transcended all the garbage.
Pentangle blends the twin acoustic
guitars of Bert Jansch and John
Renbourn with a double bass and
the other wordly vocals of Hacqui
McShee; the results just turn your
head right around. Like many
groups, they cannot be strictly
defined, and draw from folk, jazz,
blues, and classical music. Jansch
and Renbourn are too much.
Jethro Tull is the answer to all
of us who are looking for good
jazz and good rock played
together . . .1 mean like Traffic,
and none of the silly jazz-rock
Columbia promotion stuff. Lan
Anderson plays beautiful
jazz-influenced things on flute and
harmonica, Glenn Cornick lays
down your basic rock bass, and
guitarist Mick Abrahams weaves
back and forth between them.
Anderson is a versatile singer, and
the band really moves you . . .as
well as being a wonderfully
bizarre visual trip.

A zenith of sorts was reached
at Grace Catherdral's
"Sensorium" last January. If you
were there, you know; if not, I
can't begin to tell you. A
thousand or so speakers, full of
cricket sounds, loon calls, Steve
Miller, and the Catherdral
organ . . .a couple thousand
people (as flowers, the moon,
water, love,etc.) moving in
processions of ritual . . .dozens of
light sources filling the building
with slides and colors of beauty
and life and that sort of
thing . . .you get the idea. We
really are all one, you know.
For a comparably moving
experience, something like the
music of Smoke is required.
They're another of those beautiful
entities which refuse to be picked
apart. A review will come later,
but, for now, go listen. At once.
The musicians are totally
sympathetic with each other and
with the direction of the whole.
They are: Kenny Washington on
sax, steel drum, maracas; Fred
Barry on trumpet and various
rhythm instruments; Woody Wedd
on vibes and piano; Chris Christy
on bass; and John Felder on
drums. That's all you really need
to know. Their music, simply, is
just a whole lot better than more
things being done these days.
Other noteworthy
appearances: the Byrds, who I
guess will thankfully always be
the Byrds; Mike Bloomfield and
his friends, free of the
SuperSchlockSession crap, and
back into joyfully mellow things;
Chuck Berry who, even when
backed by incompetents like the
Initial Schock, always reminds us
once again what it's really all
about.
And Bob Dylan's album.
And, of course, the Grateful
Dead, perennial winners of the
Livin' is East award, who need no
further embellishment here. Their
live album, not relased until June,
but currently being previewed on
KSAN, will give you some idea of
what San Francisco has been like.
It is probably the finest American
album ever made.
There have been a few
disappointments amidst all these
goodies, but I'll save the Things
We Should Have Avoided
department until later. Forget
about it and go listen to Smoke.
Yeah, well, life can be okay
sometimes. . .like when you can
listen to Dorothy Marrison and
the Northern California State
Youth Choir singing "Oh Happy
Day"and all those other nice
things on their album. I'm sure
this will remain overplayed and
we'll have to hear a lot of hype
about gospel-rock or some, such
nonsense; but all that can be
easily avoided, and powerful
music, masterfully arranged and
produced, is the reward.
And the music has been just
fine throughout the winter, if you
forgot all the bullshit that is
becoming such f .n integral part of
the rock scene. Janis and Grace
are still written up everywhere,
but Tracy Nelson, the chick with
Mother Earth, shouldn't be
overlooked. She might lack the
balls of Janis or the ethereal
harmonies of Grace, but she has
qualities of both that often prove
far more satisfying. The band

transcended all the garbage.
Pentangle blends the twin acoustic
guitars of Bert Jansch and John
Renbourn with a double bass and
the other wordly vocals of Hacqui
McShee; the results just turn your
head right around. Like many
groups, they cannot be strictly
defined, and draw from folk, jazz,
blues, and classical music. Jansch
and Renbourn are too much.
Jethro Tull is the answer to all
of us who are looking for good
jazz and good rock played
together . . .1 mean like Traffic,
and none of the silly jazz-rock
Columbia promotion stuff. Lan
Anderson plays beautiful
jazz-influenced things on flute and
harmonica, Glenn Cornick lays
down your basic rock bass, and
guitarist Mick Abrahams weaves
back and forth between them.
Anderson is a versatile singer, and
the band really moves you . . .as
well as being a wonderfully
bizarre visual trip.

A zenith of sorts was reached
at Grace Catherdral's
"Sensorium" last January. If you
were there, you know; if not, I
can't begin to tell you. A
thousand or so speakers, full of
cricket sounds, loon calls, Steve
Miller, and the Catherdral
organ . . .a couple thousand
people (as flowers, the moon,
water, love,etc.) moving in
processions of ritual . . .dozens of
light sources filling the building
with slides and colors of beauty
and life and that sort of
thing . . .you get the idea. We
really are all one, you know.
For a comparably moving
experience, something like the
music of Smoke is required.
They're another of those beautiful
entities which refuse to be picked
apart. A review will come later,
but, for now, go listen. At once.
The musicians are totally
sympathetic with each other and
with the direction of the whole.
They are: Kenny Washington on
sax, steel drum, maracas; Fred
Barry on trumpet and various
rhythm instruments; Woody Wedd
on vibes and piano; Chris Christy
on bass; and John Felder on
drums. That's all you really need
to know. Their music, simply, is
just a whole lot better than more
things being done these days.
Other noteworthy
appearances: the Byrds, who I
guess will thankfully always be
the Byrds; Mike Bloomfield and
his friends, free of the
SuperSchlockSession crap, and
back into joyfully mellow things;
Chuck Berry who, even when
backed by incompetents like the
Initial Schock, always reminds us
once again what it's really all
about.
And Bob Dylan's album.
And, of course, the Grateful
Dead, perennial winners of the
Livin' is East award, who need no
further embellishment here. Their
live album, not relased until June,
but currently being previewed on
KSAN, will give you some idea of
what San Francisco has been like.
It is probably the finest American
album ever made.
There have been a few
disappointments amidst all these
goodies, but I'll save the Things
We Should Have Avoided
department until later. Forget
about it and go listen to Smoke.
Yeah, well, life can be okay
sometimes. . .like when you can
listen to Dorothy Marrison and
the Northern California State
Youth Choir singing "Oh Happy
Day"and all those other nice
things on their album. I'm sure
this will remain overplayed and
we'll have to hear a lot of hype
about gospel-rock or some, such
nonsense; but all that can be
easily avoided, and powerful
music, masterfully arranged and
produced, is the reward.
And the music has been just
fine throughout the winter, if you
forgot all the bullshit that is
becoming such f .n integral part of
the rock scene. Janis and Grace
are still written up everywhere,
but Tracy Nelson, the chick with
Mother Earth, shouldn't be
overlooked. She might lack the
balls of Janis or the ethereal
harmonies of Grace, but she has
qualities of both that often prove
far more satisfying. The band
keeps changing personnel, but
they were a dynamic lot when
appearing at the Matrix, a
delightful spot on Fillmore near
Lombard, which has also recently
featured Jorma Kaukonen and
Jack Casady (Unaccompanied)
and Elvin Bishop's band.
Kaukonen and Casady are
absolutely supreme in this sort of
interplay and their forthcoming
album should be incredible.
Bishop's crew has the character of
the Matrix itself: not all that
classy, but fun and quite lovable.
Country Joe and the Fish gave
a nostalgic ''farewell''
performance, full of warmth in
the collective remembrance of
things that were and sadness over
that which will never be. Then Joe
and Barry recently surfaced with a
new group, made up of ex-Big
Brother members Albin and Getz
(on bass and drums) and a tasty
country-oriented keyboard man.
They're back into carefree,
relaxed music, and "There I Go
Again" is one of the nicer songs to
emerge of late.
