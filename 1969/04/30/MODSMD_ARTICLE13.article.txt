# Japanese Students Compare Cultures

"By our standards, the AEL
demonstration was moderate and
calm. To think of a wedding at a
sit-in would be impossible for us
in Japan." These observations
were offered by Nanako Watanabe
and Tetsu Yoshida, two of the
Keio exchange * students. At
Tokyo universities, sit-ins express
desperation as much as here, but
the tactics and modd are
different. Barricades are built to
keep out police as well as
opposing students. In their battles
students wear metal helmets and
wield long wooden planks. Those
familar with the various student
groups can tell which are fighting
by the distinctive colors of their
helmets.
Tetsu's major concern at the
university is student politics. He
works for one of the radical
student newspapers and also
belongs to the Japanese Student's
Anti-Communist Party. To
preface his comments, Tetsu
informed me, "Most American
and Japanese students are
politically apathetic."
Although the "dedicated"
radicals comprise only 200 out of
22,000 Keio students, they were
able to close two of the four Keio
campuses last summer. The issues
were very familar —chemical-
biological warfare and U.S. Army
funded research in Japanese
universities. The demands were
never realized as the strike ended
in a battle between opposing
student factions. "We were beaten
by the other students," conceded
Tetsu.
At points in our talk, Nanako
would interject, "That's not so,"
to show her disagreement with

Tetsu. Controversy about the
importance of student movements
is easily as great in Japan as in the
U.S.
Nanaka and Tetsu found more
common ground on he subject of
student life at Japanese
universities. According to the pair,
who have just completed their
second year at Keio, many
students never have classes with
members of the opposite sex until
they come to the university.
"Well." laughed Nanako, "there
were two boys in my kindergarten
class."
I was surprised to learn that
most college students live at
home. Residence universities, as
we know them, do not exist in
Japan. Consequently, a wealth of
clubs have grown up to meet the
needs of making friends. These
gatherings allow students to meet
outside the contexts of their
families—something new in Japan.
In the postwar years more girls
have been entering the
universities, although academics
are still considered a man's
domain. A girl who has finished
her education is not encouraged
to apply her education to a job.
Nanako says, "Many Japanese
men do not consider a girl who
has worked as appealing as one

who has not." But the feeling is
changing.
The custom of arranged
marriages persists. Through
university clubs, men and women
students can meet casually which
will probably bring a change in
marriage practices. However, the
feeling still exists, though not as
strongly as once, that the
"romance" marriages of the
western world are not as stable as
the methodical, arranged ones of
traditional Japan.
Nanaka and Tetsu have
enjoyed living with students on
the campus. "It has been so free;
it has been like a dream for me,"
said Nanako. Girls in Japan must
follow fairly strict codes of
behavior, spoken and unspoken.
Her stay at Stanford and at Grove
House has been quite a change of
pace. Tetsu chose to live at Beta
Chi after visiting the house several
times with his host brother. "You
know,"he told me, "there are lots
of students who are
anti-imperialists up at the house. I
can agree with them."
Both agreed that they found
Americans hospitable. Tetsu
remarked quite seriously, "You
have to realize that our status as
visitors had made our experiences
here little more real than dreams."
All sixteen of the Keio
exchange students will be
returning to Japan at the end of
next week. This summer Nanako
will be the official hostess of the
Stanford students who come to
stay at Keio University. At both
schools the exchange program is
sponsored by the students
themselves. Although each
student pays for his own plane
fare, host families and individual
dorms pay for the living costs
while the students are visiting.
Each year visiting Keio students
put on a Japan night program at
our I-Center.
