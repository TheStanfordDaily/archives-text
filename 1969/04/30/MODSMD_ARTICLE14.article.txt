# New Probation Man In East Palo Alto
## 
### 
"Do you like my Daishiki?"
Charles Range asked pointing to
his colorful blue green shirt. "I
find it gives me instant rapport
with the kids. They know where
you stand and they know you are
for real."
Range, 29, is the director of
the East Palo Alto branch of the
San Mateo County Probation
Department's new office. Located
at 2148 University Avenue, the
probation department opened
April 15.
"I don't pull any punches,"
explained Range. "When I was
first assigned to this 80% black
community of 28,000 in 1967, I
objected strongly. At that time
there was only half a probation
officer assigned to the area, and I
felt that it was showing tokenism
to assign one black officer."
The East Palo Alto Municipal
Council appointed a Citizen's
Advisory Commission to decide
what the community needed.

They asked for six full time
probation officers, three whites
and three black. The director was
to be black. A new careers
concept was to be provided by six
college students.
"To show the kind of work our
community workers do," Range
said, "a few months ago a young
black girl in a San Mateo County
receiving home, went for months
without having her hair washed.
The white workers at this
institution for homeless children,
did not know how to groom a
black hair. Two of our workers
took her to their own homes to
, fix her hair."
Vernon Puckett, called the
escape artist, was a fifteen year
old boy who had a history of
running away. Reverend Albert
Williams of our community was
able to bring the kid back into
custody after spending three solid
days talking to him and his
parents.
