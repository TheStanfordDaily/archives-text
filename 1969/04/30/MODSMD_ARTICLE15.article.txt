"About three-fourths of
America's Negroes outside the
South read a daily newspaper
'yesterday'. Young Negro adults
use the newspaper more than do
older Negroes; the reverse is true
for white adults . .
These are part of the
summarized findings on "Negroes'
Use of the Media," one of a series
of research booklets compiled by
Prof. Chilton R. Bush, retired
professor of Communications at
Stanford.
