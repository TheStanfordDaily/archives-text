# Campus Radicals Tell Us That Tactics Should Be Overlooked, And That We Should Focus on Their Issues. We Disagree—
## TACTICS ARE IMPORTANT! 
### John R. Searle 
From The New York Times Magazine, December 29, 1968
Excerpts from "A Foolproof Scenario For Student Revolts''

"The small minority with no legitimate grievance"
starts out by selecting an issue. Curiously, almost any
old issue will do. At Berkeley it concerned the campus
rules on political activity; at Columbia it was the loca
tion of a gym; at Nanterre, a protest at the offices of
T.W.A. and the Chase Manhattan Bank; at Essex it
was a visit by a representative of the Ministry of De
fense, and many places have used recruiters from the
Dow Chemical Company and other variations on the
theme of the war in Vietnam.
Almost any issue will do, provided it has two crucial
features: (1) It must be an issue that can be somehow
related to a Sacred Topic. In the United States, the
Sacred Topics are the First Amendment, race and the
war in Vietnam —in that order, though I believe that
in the last year race has been pulling ahead of the First
Amendment. (In France, la revolution is itself a
Sacred Topic.) If the issue can be related to a Sacred
Topic, then the majority of students, even though they
would not do anything about it themselves, will at
least be sympathetic to the demonstrators' position
in the early stages. (2) The issue has to be one on
which the university authorities cannot give in."
"In Stage Two the original issue is transformed so
that the structure of authority in the university is
itself the target. This is achieved by the following
method. The fact that the university rejected the orig
inal demands and, even more, the fact that the uni
versity disciplined people for rule violations in making
those demands are offered as conclusive proof that the
university is the real enemy of the forces of truth and
justice on the Sacred Topic. Thus, if the original de
mand was related to the war in Vietnam, the fact that
the university disciplined a student for rule violation
in making the demand is proof that the university
is really working for the war and that it is out to "crush
dissent. If, for example, the demonstrations were
against Dow Chemical Company recruiters on cam
pus, the fact of university discipline proves that the
university is really the handmaiden (or whore) of
the military-industrial complex. And the fact that the
university refuses to cancel plans for the gym (Col
umbia) or does cancel plans for the Cleaver course
(Berkeley) demonstrates that the university is really
a racist institution. Why would anybody try to discip
line our fellow students and refuse our just demands if
they weren t racists, warmongers or dissent-cruchers,
as the case might be- And, indeed, can't we now see
that the university is really just a part of much larger

forces of oppression (imperialism, racism) in our
American society? In the face of such proof, only the
most callous or evil would fail to join us in our struggle
to make this a livable university, a place where we
can be truly free."
If this attempt to make the university the primary
target is successful, the number of people involved in
Stage Two will increase enormously. Large numbers
of students who will not demonstrate illegally against
the war in Vietnam or for free speech will demonstrate
illegally if they can demonstrate against sonmeone's
being disciplined for illegally demonstrating against
the war in Vietnam or for free speech. The original
issue is made much more personal, local and "rele
vant" to their life as students by being redefined, with
the university authorities as the main enemy. The war
in Vietnam is a long way off, but Grayson Kirk's office
is just across the campus. This redefinition of the issue
so that the university authorities become the main tar
get is crucial to the success of the entire operation and
is the essential characteristic of a successful Stage
Two.
Speeches, leaflets, meetings and articles in student
papers all serve to create a certain rhetorical climate
in which charges that would normally be thought to
verge on the preposterous can gain currency and
acceptability. Thus, the president of the university is
is a racist, the board of regents is trying to run the uni
versity for its personal profit, the university is funda
mentally an agent of the Pentagon and so on. Anyone
who remembers the witch hunts of the ninteen-fifties
will recognize the distinctive features of this rhetorical
atmosphere: the passionate conviction that our side is
right and the other side not only wrong but evil, the
urgency of the issue, the need for all of us to stand
united against the threat (of Communism or the mili
tary-industrial complex, depending on your choice of
era) and, most important, the burning sincerity of all
but the most intelligent.
To accuse a professor of doing secret war research
for the Defense Department nowadays has the same
delicious impact that accusations of secret Communist
party members did a decade ago. And one even reads
the same sort of nervous, apologetic prose on the part
of the accused. " 'I was consultant [to the Institute for
Defense Analysis] from 1964—67, when I went to meet
ings and listened and offered comments; however, you
will not find my name on the reports,' he said" (The
Daily Californian, Tuesday, Nov. 5, 1968, p. 1). The
ultimate in such accusations—leaving out such hor
rendous charges as "He worked for the C.l.A."—are
He s a racist and"He is in favor of the war." We are

incidentally, going to see a great deal more of this
left-McCarthyism in the next few years on college
campuses, especially in the United States."
"In a crazy kind of way, television also dignifies the
proceedings. If you are at a demonstration at noon
and you can go home and watch yourself on the 6
o'clock news, it suddenly means that the noon behav
ior is lifted out of the realm of juvenile shenanigans
and becomes genuine historical stuff. If you are there
on the box it must be pretty serious, an authentic revo
lutionary event."
"It is very important in Stage Two that a few faculty
members side with the demonstrators "on the issues."
In general, they will not directly condone rule viola
tions, but by supporting the issues of Stage One they
add a stamp of approval to the whole enterprise and
thus have the effect of indirectly excusing the rule
violations: "it is unfortunate that there should be any
disruption of the university, but it really is awful that
the administration should kick poor Smith out just for
sitting peacefully and nonviolently on the dean's desk
for a few hours, especially when Smith was only try
ing to end Racism and the war in Vietnam."
"At the end of Stage Two, there is a large-scale
demonstration against the university on the issue of
Stage One as transformed by the rhetorical impact of
Stage Two. In the United States it takes the form of
a large sit-in, though this has recently been develop
ing into the seizure ("liberation") of a building, com
plete with baracaded doors and windows. (In Paris,
it was also a matter of building street barricades, but
street barricades are a French tradition, not easily
exportable, that somehow seems to survive; the sur
vival is aided by the presence of small cars that can
be used as building material.) When the sit-in or seiz
ure occurs, the university authorities are strongly in
clined to —and usually do—call out the police to arrest
the people who are sitting in. When that happens, if
all has gone according to the scenario, we enter Stage
Three, and we enter it with a vengeance.
THE COLLAPSE OF AUTHORITY
The first characteristic of Stage Three is an enor
mous and exhiliarating feeling of revulsion against the
calling of the police. The introduction of hundreds of
policemen on the campus is regarded as the ultimate
crime that any university administration can commit,
and a properly led and well-organized student move
ment will therefore direct all of its efforts in Stages
One and Two to creating a situation in which the
authorities feel they have no choice but to call the
police. Large numbers of faculty members who have
so far watched nervously from the sidelines, vaguely
sympathetic with the students' rhetoric but unwilling

to condone the rule violations, are suddenly liberated.
They are rejuvenated by being able to side with the
forces of progress against the forces of authority; the
anxieties of Stages One and Two are released in a
wonderful surge of exhilaration: we can hate the ad
ministration for calling the cops instead of having to
tut-tut at the students for their bad behavior. On the
students' side, there is a similar euphoria. In Berkeley,
the student health service reported in 1964 a sharp de
cline in the number of students seeking psychological
and psychiatric help dining Stage Three.
In the transition to Stage Three, the more police
brutality you can elicit by baiting and taunting (or the
more the police are able to provide by themselves in
the absence of such incitement), the better, but, as
any competent leader knows, police brutality is not,
strictly speaking, necessary because any large-scale
mass arrest will produce accusations of police brutal
ity no matter what happens.
In the face of the sheer horror of the police on cam
pus, the opposition to the movement, especially the
oppostion among the liberal and moderate students,
becomes enfeebled and usually collopses altogethre.
At this point, there is a general student strike with
fairly strong faculty support, and quite often the cam
pus will be completely shut down.
Furthermore, the original demands of Stage One
are now only a small part of a marvelously escalated
series of demands."
"When administrations are defeated, they almost
invariably go down as a result of technical mistakes,
failure to grasp the nature of the struggle they are en
gaged in and, most important, their own demoraliza
tion. A confident administration bent on defending
intellectual values, and consequently determined to
destroy the power of its essentially anti-intellectual
adversary, can generally win. Victory for the adminis
tration requires a readiness to deal with each of the
three stages on its own terms and certain over-all
strategies involving internal university reforms and
the intelligent use of discipline (even including the
police when it comes to the crunch ). Curiously, many
college administrations in America don't yet seem to
perceive that they are all in this together. Like buf
faloes being shot, they look on with interest when
another of their number goes down, without seriously
thinking that they may be next."
