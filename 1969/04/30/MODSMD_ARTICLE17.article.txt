LACROSSE
The University of California
Bears were up for the game in
lacrosse against archrival Stanford
Saturday, but the Indians power
proved too much. Stanford
coasted to a 10-1 victory.
The Tribe scored with only
fifty seconds gone as Chip
Loveman fed Ted Suen streaking
by the goal on a beautifully
executed play, and started
•Mibstituting freely. Stanford ran
five midfields in regular rotation
instead of the customary three.
Getting into the game, one
midfielder remarked, was like
"trying to get on a flight
stand-by."
No less than nine Stanford
players scored goals. Only
midfielder John Hanley scored
more than one goal and his two
brought the Stanford total to ten.
The Indians found that they could
beat their men one-on-one early in
the afternoon and that is what
they did. Only four of the goals
were assisted.
Only a minute after Suen's
goal, Stu Childs dodged two men
and steamed one into the goal. He
was followed soon after by Tom
Kidde and Ben Smith to round
out the first quarter scoring.

The Indians played an
extremely unsettled second
quarter and' did not score at all.
Not until Hanley scored from the
restraining line did a
twenty-minute goal drought end.
Hanley scored the only other goal
in the half, eoccept for Cal's lone
goal, which bounced off of Doug
Mackenzie's foot and rolled
passed the surprised Stanford
goalie Dan Clement.
The Indians turned on the
steam again in the fourth quarter
with strikes from Don Stebbins,
Bill Callison, Chip Loveman, and
George Muser.
Stanford Coach George
Weiksner showed restrained
optimism about his charges
performance as a warm-up for this
weekend's titanic battles in
Colorado against the Air Force
Academy and Denver University.
"We made less really elementary
mistakes today—simple things like
offsides infractions—which would
kill us in Colorado."
Weiksner seemed pleased with
the way Indians were finding the
breaking man on clears and
general midfield play. But he
warned that there is no way to
telling how good a team is that
has never been tested.


UPSETTING EVENT-Stanford's freshman whiz, Chris Chapin, scored the
biggest upset of the first round of the California State Tennis Championships
when he defeated fourth seeded (Jene Cantin. Chapin, unseeded, turned the
trick 64, 0-6, 6-2. The tourney, running through Saturday at Alpine Mills in
Portola Valley, contains numerous Stanford players. Freshman Mac Claflin was
not as lucky as Chapin, as he fell from his number 15 seed in the early going.
Varsity leader Dean Schlobohm won his match by default, but Stan Pasarcll
forfeited his. Paul Marienthal advanced to the next round as did frosh Paul
Gerkin who blanked his opponent in straight sets.
