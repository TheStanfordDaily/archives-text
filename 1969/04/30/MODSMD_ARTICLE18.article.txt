# New Club
## First Surf Victory 
### 
Last Thursday night, the
Stanford Surfing Club was
formed. The first meeting was
held, and the opening activities
were discussed.
The next morning at 10:00
a.m., eight club members took off
for Santa Cruz and the first active
competition, a three-way meet
with host UCSC, and Santa Clara.
By the time the day was over,
the experienced Stanford Surfing
Club had garnered its first victory.
Under a hot sun, the Indian
squad took to their boards and
compiled the top team totai in the
seven heats to walk off with the
top prize in the new
Tri-lnvitational Surfing Meet. It
was an amazing win for the group
from the Farm, one that they
didn't even know they had
achieved until the official results
were tabulated.
The meet was scored by a
panel of five judges. Each school
entered one contestant in all of
the seven heats, and points were
awarded for first, second, and
third places in each event. The
scoring system proved to be the
difference for the Stanford team.
They won only one individual
heat, that taken by Rick Wilson
early in the day. It was the over-all
team strength of the Tribe that
enabled them to build up points
with consistent second place
finishes.
The waves were good with a
right break, Santa Clara won four
heats and Santa Cruz the

remaining two. The Broncos
finished second, and the host
UCSC team last.
