# Trustee Gardner Says Open Meeting 'Silly Idea'
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Trustee John Gardner told about 100
students outside the Faculty Club
yesterday that he was not prepared to
issue his "final judgment" on severance
of University ties with SRI. Shortly
afterwards, he broke off the impromptu
conversation.
Interrupted from his lunch, Gardner
talked for about 35 minutes with the
students, most of them April 3rd
Movement members. Gardner earlier
had refused an invitation to attend their
noon meeting outside Tresidder Union.
The students' remarks became heated
after Gardner did not give direct
responses to their questions. Many in
the crowd were further angered when
Gardner challenged them by saying,
"Why do you think open meetings are a
good idea? I think the open meeting is
the silliest idea I've heard in years."
The exchange ended abruptly after
SDS leader Fred Cohen demanded of
Gardner, "What moral commitment are
you going to make on our issues?"
Gardner responded, "Many Trustees
are afraid that this kind of situation is
often set up to demean and vilify them.
You're not interested in civil discourse
at this type of meeting. Therefore, I'm
through." Then Gardner turned his back
and walked away.

Early in the discussion, Gardner
avoided the student's major question of
SRI ties stating, "I'm not prepared to
give a final judgment on the issue of SRI
from what I've learned in the last 24
hours."
Gardner, who has been on campus
since Sunday night investigating campus
opinion on the structure of the Board of
Trustees, told the students, "I've been
constantly attending a series of
meetings and talking to an enormous
amount of people about Board structure
in my day and a half stay here. I'm not
as up on the issue of SRI as you are."
He insisted, however, "I'll be glad to
listen to anything you have to say about
SRI and the University." Steve
Weissman, member of the April 3rd
Movement, asked Gardner, "Under what
conditions do you feel a University or a
research institute is justified in engaging
in counter-insurgency and war-related
research dealing with countries such as
Laos, Thailand, and Vietnam?"
"In all my dealings with international
research centers," answered Gardner,
"I've assumed that the determination of
the research done is the business of the
individual researchers."
He added, "The Board of Trustees
shouldn't necessarily have the decision"
at Stanford.

He then asked the students, "If SRI
were brought into the University, would
researchers exercise some control over
their own research?" but he was given
no unified response.
Student Mary lianson demanded,
"Can you give deference to individual
researchers while a large part of the
community disagrees with them, and
while the Vietnamese are dying becau%
of some of their research?"
"I've answered a lot more questions
than you have," Gardner retorted, "and
I've been through all kinds of
confrontations . . .I'm not afraid to
answer your questions."
Scholars Should Decidc
When asked if students should have a
say in what types of research go on in a
University, Gardner answered, "The
community of scholars should make the
decision either individually or
collectively of what research should go
on. "If they want to listen to students,
then that's all right with me."
Graduate student Chick Fitts told
Gardner, "You sound like an anarchist
by stating that anyone can do anything
that they want . . .
"We categorically reject that
researchers can do that."
Graduate student Jeanne Friedman
emphasized that "You're talking about
preserving the right of researcheis to do
research and we're asking you if you
believe that the peoples of the world
have a right to live . . .
"We're asking you if researchers have
the iight to do research which helps
murder people."
"Why are you standing there refusing
to answer nur questions" she further
asked Gardner, "when these issues have
been raised since October?"
Another student attacked Gardner's
fai'ure to state his position, calling it a
"mindless evasion," and declared "it's
absurd to think that the man hasn't
thought of the issue of SRI."
Then addressing Gardner, he asked,
''We're not asking for a final
judgment; we want to know just what
are you thinking"
