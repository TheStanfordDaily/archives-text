# New Student Involvement
## 
### 
The Student Involvement
Team of Community House, East
Palo Alto, has been active in the
Mid-Peninsula area for two years.
During the next school year,
the team will focus on the issues
of public education generally and
highschool education specifically.
Involvement in the issues of the
Sequoia district, where
mis-education of all students and
sub-education of black students
are major problems, will be
emphasized.
In the Palo Alto district, much
work is needed to prevent the
Multi-Cultural Program from
becoming hollow tokenism.
Organization and education in
local white communities with
respect to social problems, racism
in particular, will be undertaken.
A team conducted seminar for
Stanford students will attempt to
relate to local issues with the goal
of greater student involvement.
Summer Program
There will also be a summer
program. Participation in the
summer program is encouraged,
however, it is not mandatory. A
$150.00 per month living
allowance will be paid for the
summer.
For more information and/or
an application please go to the
U.C.M. office, third floor of the
clubhouse.
