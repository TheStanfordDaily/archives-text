### 
The new space engineering building is
closed to "unauthorized persons" until
Thursday at 8 a.m. and is being guarded
around the ciock by students and
professors in the Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics.
The building was ordered closed by
Jean Mayers, vice-chairman of the
department. Mayers said last night that,
"I closed the building by unilateral
action and will keep it closed unless I
am told otherwise."
At 10:30 last night members of the
April 3 Movement marched to the
guarded building, reading the following
tongue-in-cheek message to people in
the building:
"We, the April 3 Movement extend
our solid support to our comrades
occupying the space engineering
building tonight.
"Your action is sure to illuminate the
class nature of our struggle against the
corporate elite.
"And even though we have not been
sufficiently informed of your goals, we
heartily support you in your choice of
tactics.
"Long live the April 29 Movement."
Students in the building responded
with their own message, noting their
"delight" at receiving support for their
legitimate actions.
Mayers explained the order to close
the building, commenting, "The
building is closed in view of the damage
done during the sit-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory. I think it is the
best thing we could do to protect our
interests."
The building was patrolled last night
by about 20 students and professors.
Doors were locked and photographers
were poised inside the main doors.
Mayer explained that the students,
"would be at the entrance to document
any illegal entrance."
The following statement, signed by
Mayers, was posted on every door:
"This building is restricted to
authorized personnel only during th»>
period 5:00 p.m. Tuesday, April 29 to

8:00 a.m. Thursday, May 1, 1969. The
