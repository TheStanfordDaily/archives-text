## Consensus On SRI 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
At this crisis moment in the SRI
controversy, it is important to recognize
that the University has arrived at a clear
consensus on the future of our research
affiliate.
The consensus, quite simply, is that
SRI should not be sold and that certain
kinds of military research should cease.
Both faculty and students support this
position, and it seems only a matter of
time before key administrators join
them.
The student body has voiced its
overwhelming support for the consensus
position on SRI through two
referendums, several petitions, and mass
demonstrations. In the recent
questionnaire, no less than 68 percent
of the students voted to keep SRI and
reform its research policies.
The faculty, although certainly less
united than the students, also favored
the consensus position in the
questionnaire. Fully 62 percent voted to
restrict the kinds of research SRI can
do. But the faculty was divided on how
to achieve this goal: 35 percent said

keep SRI, while 27 percent said sell
with a restrictive covenant
The foot-dragging of the Academic
Senate at least shows that they feel sale
of SRI is unacceptable. And if SRI is
not sold, more than two-thirds of the
faculty favor some research restrictions.
President Pitzer has thus far been
silent in public on SRI. But he has not
been neutral on the question of military
research. Pitzer played a key role in
persuading the trustees to stop new
CBW contracts at SRI, and he took a
strong position against classified
research at Stanford. Judging by these
stands and his oft-expressed disgust with
the Vietnam War and the Pentagon, it
seems plausible that Pitzer will come
down on the side of reform at SRI.
The strength of this consensus on
SRI puts the Board of Trustees in an
uncomfortable, or perhaps intolerable,
situation The University community is
united in asking the Board to do
something it doesn't want to do. A
confrontation is inevitable, with the
Trustees backed up against a wall.
The student bodv has already made

an explicit threat.
In the April 18 referendum, 53
percent of the students voting said they
would "participate in a sit-in or similar
means of protest" of the Trustees do
not "positively respond to the desire of
the Stanford community regarding
research at Stanford and SRI and in
resolving the future relationship
between Stanford and SRI by May 14."
The Trustees next meeting is May 13, in
San Francisco.
Ironically, the Trustees have done
much to create their own dilemma.
During the past two months, the Board
has made a great show of its efforts to
solicit campus opinion. Faculty and
student delegations have been heard,
questionnaires have been distributed,
and today a group of trustees will hear
testimony.
The Board has done all these things
because it wants to ease campus
frustration and prevent sit-ins. But the
strategem has a serious flaw: When
people are continually asked for their
opinion, they soon come to expect that
their opinion will be heeded.
