# Meeting And Petitions
## Movement Debates Plans 
### LANG ATWOOD 
The April 3rd Movement presented
petitions signed by 3,544 persons to
Stanford's President Kenneth S. Pitzer
yesterday afternoon. The petitions
demanded that the entire Board of
Trustees hold an open community
meeting on campus today in place of
the scheduled restricted committee
hearing.
John Shippe representing the

Movement explained to Pitzer that
students need some indication that the
Trustees sense the same urgency as the
community about resolving the "serious
issue" of the Stanford Research
Institute's (SRI) relationship to the
University. If they don't heed the
student's demand for an open meeting,
the board will lose its legitimacy," he
added.
Pitzer insisted that "Trustees have
sought and are learning the views of the
students."
"I simply ask you to realize how
much is being done to gain student
opinion," he said.
It was decided at a general meeting
of the Movement last night to postpone
any decision regarding the future
occupation of buildings or other tactics
until the noon rally today or possibly
until after the conclusion of the hearing
in the afternoon.
Lenny Siegel of SDS, suggested that
after the hearing th"! Movement should
determine which building is most
important to the 1 rustees and take it.
He added that they should let the
hearing take place without disruption so
that everyone would be able to observe
how the Trustees act. Marc Sapir,
Marc Sapir, recently married in a
"community ceremony" at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, expressed the
view that most people on campus know
that the Trustee committee hearing is
just a sham.
Mark Heller a member of SDS, said
at last night's meeting that they
shouldn't be talking about specific
action that might be taken, but should
only seek a sense of the community on
the direction being taken by the
Movement.
"The biggest danger we face is taking
an action that will take the focus away
from our demands," explained Dave
Pugh.
"We have nothing to gain by having
one person bust into the (committee)
meeting," he added.

Fred Cohen said that the important
thing was to "discuss how we are going
to win." He suggested that after the
Trustee's committee meeting the
Movement should hold a
decision making meeting in Memorial
Auditorium.
Noting that the representatives of
SRI at the committee hearing will be all
administrators, Mary Hanson proposed a
motion which was passed unanimously
by the 200 people in attendance, which
demands that SRI staff members and
researchers be allowed to watch the
proceedings.
The motion directed to SRI
President Charles Anderson demands
that all SRI employees b<Â» allowed and
encouraged to attend the closed-circuit
television broadcast in Memorial
Auditorium. And furthermore that they
receive a full day's pay on Wednesday.
The front page of yesterday's
Declassified, a Movement publication
carried the headline, "Any Hour Now"
above a map of the campus that had
nine buildings circled and numbered.
On the inside pages the role of each
building in the "military-industrial
university complex" was described
along with the facilities available in he
event of occupation. Encina Hall, a
former dormitory now used by various
departments of the administration led
the list. It was followed by the Hoover
Institution and the Garduate School of
Business.
An editorial on the back page said,
"It is clear that our demands will not be
met until we take action to force the
Trustees to accept them." The editorial
went on to reject faculty and
administration response as "a token,
meaningless concession while continuing
to express their 'deep concern."
The editorial concluded by saying
that "the faculty, administration, and
especially the Trustees will do only
wbat we force them to do, but we
continue to allow them to distract and
delav us."
