# Trustee Failure
## 
### 
In some ways it seems to us that if the
trustees are a sample of America's ruling
elite, then that ruling elite's days of power
are numbered.
We have been almost dumbfounded
while observing the trustees inaction. The
hea vy-handedness of their operations
surprise us. We had expected men more
subtle and sophisticated.
John W. Gardner has been on campus
for two days. In private meetings and
-public appearances, we have found him
significantly similar in manner and thinking
to the trustees at the March 11 forum. Yet
iiere is a man reputed to be the most
progressive of all those who sit on
Stanford's Board.
Mr. Gardner is in a sense the highest
evolutionary form of the species modern
liberal. But' Gardner has not shown us he
knows what is going on at this university.
Outside the faculty club yesterday,
Gardner told students that he thought that
an open meeting of the trustees was the
silliest suggestion he had heard in years.
To contradict Gardner, a government of
the university which is able to sustain
people's confidence while conducting
business in the open would have meaning
for the community. The uneasiness which
the trustees feel in the face of a call for an

open meeting comes because the trustees
recognize tiie aura of authority which
secrecy lends to their meetings and because
the trustees know they are not trusted by a
large segment of Stanford's population.
John Gardner was unable to answer
satisfactorily the questions put to him
outside the faculty club about war
research. Members of the April 3
Movement asked Gardner whether he
valued more highly other people's right to
their own lives or a researcher's right to do
researcii leading to death. He ducked the
question.
Despite manifest inability to understand
the urgency of the SRI issues and other
campus concerns, the trustees still hold
power. When their system stumbles because
of incompetency or because of its flawed
nature, they still have that power at their
command. In order to wield power
efficiently and crush insurgency, men like
the trustees have corrupted the university.
Judging by the past performance of the
trustees, it will not be necessary for the
April 3 Movement to disrupt the hearing.
" 'Tis sport to see the engineer hoist with
his own petard." The trustees will probably
show us in their hearing an exercise in
self-strangulation. The question is how the
community will stand for the trustees.

Despite manifest inability to understand
the urgency of the SRI issues and other
campus concerns, the trustees still hold

April 3 Movement to disrupt the hearing.
" 'Tis sport to see the engineer hoist with
his own petard." The trustees will probably
show us in their hearing an exercise in
self-strangulation. The question is how the
community will stand for the trustees.
