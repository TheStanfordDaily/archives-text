## No Contact With SEL Staff 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
The professional research staff
at both Stanford and SRI should
take careful note of the following:
1. At no time during the
recent "discussions" concerning
campus classified research policy
did any faculty committee or

other body initiate contacts with
the professional staff.
2. Copies of the 24 April
Senate resolution banning
classified research have not been
distributed even to the research
staff directly affected.

â€¢ Research Text
Editor, THE DAILY:
On reading again the Senate
Research Resolution Text, I

noticed the conspicuous absence
of paragraph 3(d) of the former
Research Policy Guidelines, which
reads, "The University should
enter no contract and accept no
grant that involves the collection
of social or behavioral data in a
foreign country and requires the
security clearance of any person
involved in the project." (Campus
Report Supplement No. 1,
October 24, 1968.)
The Senate Resolution does
allow contracts in which at least
some of the participants are
required to have security
clearances. Consequently, it
appears that the new guidelines
include a relaxation of the above
restriction, one that clearly
applies to "counter insurgency
research."
It looks as if the resolution is
intended to restrict some forms of
classified research while easing
limitations on others.
