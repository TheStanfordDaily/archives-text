## SES Governance Report 
### Bruce Campbell 
The SES Government
Committee report has two
principal failings.
First, the report gives no
evidence that the committee
examinej the most pressing
problem of university governance
today: the fact that conflict
resolution takes place too often in
crisis and through confrontation.
The escalating of conflicts to
the point of public resolution will
not cease until mechanisms are
worked out by which it pays to
settle conflicts in a less strident,
less emotional, less polarizing
manner. Other reforms, such as
those suggested in the report,
while important, cannot be lasting
or insuring of stability until this
major ' problem is faced and
solved. It is very unhealthy for a
university to live in a constant
state of tension.
The SES report is written with
almost a timeless quality or, at
best, leaves the impression of
being early 1960's vintage. There
are only two passages in the
report which can be construed as
reflecting the committee's
response to the crisis and
confrontation problem.
First, the committee
recommends that the president
and provost get out of day-to-day
work in order to "exert
educational leadership."
Conceivably, this could mean they
would have time to identify
potential problems and act to
avert a blowup. One doubts that
thus freeing the two top men in
the administration is even feasible
and, if it were, that it would
measurably improve the situation,
because as of now students, who
are the prime promoters of crises,
don't have the day-to-day power
to make top administrators attend
to their problems.
Academic Brush Fires
The second passage, states that
the two top men should not
engage in fighting academic brush
fires. This should be left to the
second-level administrators, who
handle the 'day-to-day' business.
What is daily business when the
university is on the verge of
collapse?
The second major failing of the
report (which may be seen as the
reverse side of the problem just
examined) is the committee's rigid
and condescending re-statement
that the university is the faculty
and students shouldn't ever forget
it, or think it could be any other
way.
The section of 'Jie report on
student participation in university
governance, it titled, with an open
declaration of its narrowness:
"Student Participation in Faculty
Committees." Flippantly
dismissing community
government, the committee gives
no evidence that it has attempted
to come to terms with the volatile
situation we are in, particularly
the fact that the issue is no longer
participation on 'your'
committees but a real share in
governing.
Approach Unwise
The committee's approach
seems, to say the least, politically
unwise. When the university may
be nearing the point of
dissolution, it hardly contributes
to deescalation of the situation
for a major faculty committee to
rigidly reassert faculty dominance
and give no evidence of being
moved in the least by any
arguments for real student power.
The major problem of
university governance is not going
to be solved by indirect references
in committee reports.
If the committee failed to
search for the causes of the
governance problem, what can we
say about them? Some people feel
that the war and the draft are the
major causes. It is alleged that

when the war is ended, student
protest will subside. There is no
doubt some truth in this. But to
maintain that the cause of student
unrest lies entirely outside the
university is to overlook some
very real grievances of students
against the university.
Quality of Education
The first of these is the quality
of education at Stanford: that,
after all, was the impetus for
initiating SES.
In its section on "Crisis
Handling," the AAUP report
states: "the most frequent
dissatisfactions expressed by
varying numbers of students are
these: (1) the existing system of
classroom work and examinations
fosters an attitude of
'gamesmanship' that is perceived
to be incompatible with true
education; (2) many faculty
members are perceived to be
uninterested in students;. . . and
(4) important aspects of
University education are irrelevant
to the students' primary interests
and concerns." All of these are
strong indictments of the faculty.
Combined with these very real
grievances against the faculty is a
feeling of powerlessness to do
anything significant about the
situation. The AAUP committee
gives as students' third
dissatisfaction that "there is
inadequate student participation
in university government."
Hayes
Denis Hayes, in a minority
report to the SES report, states, in
amplification of this point, "What
students are asking for today is
not the right to give advice, but
rather the right to help make
decisions."
"We do not want to be
dependent upon some all-faculty
group which will set up the
committees, prepare charges for
committees, determine how many
students should serve on the
committees, and review student
nominees to committees. This
becomes particularly insulting
when you realize that those
committees are merely advisory to
an exclusively faculty body which
will review their recommendations
and then make the final decision
by exclusive vote of the faculty."
The feeling of powerlessness is
focused on the issue of defining
problems. The crucial part of
decision making in the university
is deciding what matters are
worthy of attention. Students
now have such little power that
they must resort to
extra-structural means of defining
issues, such as disrupting trustee
meetings and damaging property
at the bookstore, sitting in at
laboratories.
If, then, the major causes of
unrest lie in (1) the poor quality
of education at Stanford, and (2)
student powerlessness to affect
the quality of education,
particularly the inability to
present grievances through normal
channels in a way commanding
that attention to be given to
them, we can see that
confrontation techniques are not
going to be abandoned until
institutional arrangements are
made which give students real
power to define issues and to
participate in deciding the manner
in which conflict is resolved.
This means community
government. There is nothing
vague in this concept. As Hayes
states in his minority report: the
central idea is that "there should
be a central joint student-faculty
deliberative body to evaluate and
pass judgment on items of mutual
concern."
One can imagine a variety of
structures which would further
community government. The
important change, however, will
be not structural but primarily

attitudinal. De facto, power in the
university resides in the faculty.
Hayes comments: "Somewhat
uncomfortable in its newly
acquired driver's seat, the faculty
tends to be very jealous of its
prerogatives."
"It is possible to eschew
elaborate analyses or characterize
what's really happening quite
simply. The students are saying,
'We want a piece of the action,'
and the faculty is saying, 'No."
The Study of Education can
with some justice be accused of
inconsistency. In its initial report,
it stated its conviction that
"education must be the concern
of the student himself, self-willed
and in large measure
self-directed." And yet the
government report seems, at least

from the student viewpoint, to
ignore the implications of that
statement for university
governance.
As the Foote report on
governance at Berkeley (January,
1968) noted: the preeminent
argument for student
participation in shaping
educational policy is that it is
inherent in acheving the desired
goal of involving students deeply
in the direction of their
education.
The educational ends of the
university require a deeper level of
student participation in
governance than the SES
committee is willing to admit.
