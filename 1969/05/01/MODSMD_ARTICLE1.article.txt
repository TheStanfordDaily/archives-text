# April 3rd Movement Seizes Encina Hall; Policy Of Summary Suspensions Invoked
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Encina Hall, nerve center of the
University administration, was seized at
1 a.m. this morning by the April 3rd
Movement.
At 4:30 this morning, about 200
students remained in the building.
The new sit-in was generally in
support of the Movement's demands on
SRI. At a hearing on SRI yesterday
afternoon, five Trustees angered the
Movement by failing to respond to any
questions.
During a long series of mass
meetings, the Movement voted at 10:30
p.m. to start a sit-in, and at 12:50 a.m.
chose Encina Hall as a target. About
900 persons jammed Dinkelspiel
Auditorium during the final votes.
At 2:35 a.m. today, Dean of
Students Joel Smith told the
demonstrators at Encina that they
would be given immediate, temporary
suspensions if they did not leave in 15
minutes. About 200 persons remained
in Encina all night in defiance of the
suspension order. Administrators and
faculty began circulating through the
building, recognizing individual
demonstrators and writing down their
names.
The seizure of Encina Hall is the
most serious student demonstration in
Stanford's history. The large four-story
building houses the Controllers' office,
the University Business office, the
Payroll office, the News and Publication
office, the Research Administration, the
Planning office, the General Secretary's
office, the Administrative Data
Processing office, and a large computer,
the Personnel office, and some faculty
offices.
Provost Richard Lyman, acting as
chief University officer since President
Pitzer was in Los Angeles, issued this
brief statement:
"I am shocked and appalled at this
senseless and wanton act. No
conceivable good can come of it, and
our long struggle for peace on this
campus is imperiled by it."
Lyman made no indication that
outside police would be called to quell
the demonstration.
The ASSU Council of Presidents
issued a statement condemning the sit-in
as "counterproductive." (See text
below.)
At 4 a.m. today, the University had
not decided whether to allow the several
hundred employees who work in Encina
to go to work today.
At a community meeting called on
the second floor of Encina, the
Movement voted to "encourage"
employees of the Payroll office to
continue work, so pay checks will not
be delayed. No decision was made about
other employees. The Movement voted
to prohibit cameras inside the building,
to prevent identification of

demonstrators. But no restrictions were
placed on police or faculty from
entering the building.
The Movement renamed Encina the
"Huey P. Newton Center for the Study
of Racism, Imperialism and Capitalism."
Scuffle With YAF
Attempts to enter the locked
building caused a brief, angry scuffle
with about 30 members of the
right-wing Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF), who were blocking the
front entrances. As some Movement
demonstrators entered through a back
door, others pushed the YAF members
aside and smashed the glass front doors.
Soon students were streaming
through the building, gaining entrance
to locked offices by force, as glass doors
were broken. Demonstrators were seen
looking through open files. Padlocked
file cabinets and safes throughout the
building were not tampered with,
according to observers.
A few minor injuries were reported,
both from broken glass and scattered
fist-fights between demonstrators and
YAF members.
In the third-floor offices of the News
and Publications Service, gleeful
demonstrators examined the equipment
and prepared to resurrect the printing
activities that the Movement carried on
in the Applied Electronics Laboratory
during the sit-in there April 9-18. They
found that key parts of a multilith press
had been removed to prevent its use.
The expensive IBM data processing
complex in the Encina basement was
guarded last night by police. The
demonstrators did not try to break into
any basement rooms.
Smith Starts Suspensions
In warning the demonstrators that
they would be suspended, Dean Smith
was envoking the emergency rules
President Pitzer announced following

the AEL sit-in. These rules allow
immediate, temporary suspension of
any student who participates in a sit-in.
After the 15-minute grace period
expired at 2:50 a.m., Dean Smith and
his faculty helpers broke into two
groups to make a systematic tour of the
building. The groups looked intently at
demonstrators to identify as many as
possible. One group of administrators
and faculty led by Willard Wyman
retired to stair wells and wrote down
names. No demonstrators were asked to
give names.
Climax to Long Day
The dramatic seizure of Encina
culminated a series of events that began
last Friday, when the Movement
demanded that the Trustees' SRI
hearing Wednesday be transformed into
an open meeting of the entire board.
On Tuesday, President Pitzer rejected
the demand and announced that the
hearing would go on.
At a mass meeting at noon yesterday,
the Movement discussed the hearing and
decided not to disrupt it. Another
meeting was scheduled following the
hearing.
The hearing began at 2 p.m. in a
room in Meyer Library. A large
audience watched the proceedings on
closed circuit TV in Memorial
Auditorium.
After the panel of five Trustees
repeatedly refused to respond to
student questions, Movement
representative Doron Weinberg led a
walkout at 4:30 from the hearing room.
Immediately, about 700 Movement
members began a meeting outside
Memorial Auditorium. After hours of
inconclusive debate, the crowd voted to
reconvene at 8:30 p.m.
A tense and excited crowd of 800
jammed Tresidder Large Lounge to
continue the debate. At about 10:45,

after much confusion over inconclusive
hand votes, a vote of 450-280 called for
occupation of a building that night. The
building still had to be chosen.
To ease crowding, the meeting
moved to Dinkelspiel Auditorium. As
the crowd flowed silently into the
darkened auditorium, actors of the
Stanford Opera Theatre were finishing
their dress rehearsal of "The Rape of
Lucretia." They concluded to the
applause of their instant audience.
For two hours, the crowd, now
swollen to 900, debated alternative
sit-in sites. In addition to Encina,
consideration was given to Hoover
Tower, the Space Engineering Building,
and the Business School.
Before voting in favor of Encina, the
Movement mobilized its Legal Defense
Committee and Medical Aid Team. A
decision was also made to alter the
Movement's rule of non-violence to
allow entrance to a building "by the
most humane means possible."
The April 3rd Movement takes it
name from a set of demands adopted by
a mass meeting April 3. The demands
call for a cessation of secret,
chemical-biological, counterinsurgency
and other Vietnam war-related research
at Stanford and SRI.
The Movement sponsored the sit-in
at AEL in support of the demands,
attracting widespread community
support. More than 1300 persons signed
a "Solidarity Statement" saying they
were participating in that sit-in.
