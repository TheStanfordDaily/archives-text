## Chicanos Ignored By Agustin Medina Jr. 
### 
The April, 1969 issue of the
Stanford Alumni Almanac
contains statements by seven
student leaders representing
campus constituencies ranging
from fraternities to the SDS.
Conspicuous by its absence is the
voice of the Mexican American
Student Confederation. Granted,
this group is not as long-lived as
the fraternities, nor has it as yet
put forth " non-negotiable"
demands or occupied a campus
building; nevertheless, the
Chicano at Stanford does have
views concerning the state of
American society, as well as his
place within it and is willing to
articulate them.
Certainly the omission cited
above is consistent with the image
held by many Americans of the
Mexican as a passive creature
content with what little he has.
Such a view, however, distorts the
history of the Chicano in the
Southwest and simply does not
mesh with reality.
Just as one example, Chicanos
have been in the forefront, as
participants and organizers, of
agricultural labor movements in
the Southwest since the 1880's.
Indeed, contrary to what is often
heard, such an activity as that of
Cesar Chavez's Delano grape
boycott (now nationwide) in no
way manifests a "new" or
''growing trend" among
Mexican-Americans in the use of
direct action to attempt to
alleviate the grave socioeconomic
problems confronting them.
Rather, Chavez's movement is
a continuation of labor strife on
the part of Chicanos set into
motion by the signing of strike
order by one Juan Gomez in
Texas in 1883. Moreover, though
not often reflected in national
mass media, a scan of local
Chicano newspapers is sufficient

to indicate the magnitude of
activity going on within barrios
across the Southwest geared
toward the attainment of those
amenities and opportunities that
are concomitants of the Chicano's
natural birthrights as an
American.
And though no counterparts of
Watts or Detroit have taken place
in urban areas where large
concentrations of Chicanos reside,
there is no mistaking that places
like El Paso, Texas; Denver,
Colorado; and Riverside,
California are seething with
frustration and discontent.
Many commentators on the
racial situation in America are
fond of making the comparison
between the passive Chicano and
ostensibly revolutionary-minded
segments of the black community;
yet at the same time that many
black militants were engaging in
revolutionary rhetoric, a vato by
the name of Reies Tijerina was
actually making revolution in
northern New Mexico last year.
A larger-scale example of the
Stanlord Almanac's "oversight" is
brought to light by the recent
resignation of the chairman of the
U.S. Inter-Agency Committee on
Mexican American Affairs in
protest to the disinterestedness
shown by representatives of some
of the nation's largest and most
prestigious foundations in funding
Chicano-developed proposals to
deal with problems in the barrios.
This only serves to reinforce the
views of many militant Chicanos
that no serious attention will be
payed the Mexican American until
East Los Angeles or El Paso are
left in rubble.
In dealing with the "Mexican
American problem" white
America appears to have learned
nothing from her experience with
black people. Martin Luther

King's eloquent pleas to the
conscience of white America were
not sufficient to induce massive
injections of federal funds into
black ghettos. Watts was. What
will happen with Chicanos? Many
are waiting for a response from
the larger society that does not
appear to be forthcoming. Curas,
ese, it's time to make our move.
And so it was that the vatos in
MASC were not surprised at being
overlooked by the Alumni Journal
with the strong implication that
our views are inconsequential.
Damned pissed off, to be sure, but
not surprised.

Such a view, however, distorts the
history of the Chicano in the
Southwest and simply does not
mesh with reality.
Just as one example, Chicanos
have been in the forefront, as
participants and organizers, of
agricultural labor movements in
the Southwest since the 1880's.
Indeed, contrary to what is often
heard, such an activity as that of
Cesar Chavez's Delano grape
boycott (now nationwide) in no
way manifests a "new" or
''growing trend" among
Mexican-Americans in the use of
direct action to attempt to
alleviate the grave socioeconomic
problems confronting them.
Rather, Chavez's movement is
a continuation of labor strife on
the part of Chicanos set into
motion by the signing of strike
order by one Juan Gomez in
Texas in 1883. Moreover, though
not often reflected in national
mass media, a scan of local
Chicano newspapers is sufficient

to indicate the magnitude of
activity going on within barrios
across the Southwest geared
toward the attainment of those
amenities and opportunities that
are concomitants of the Chicano's
natural birthrights as an
American.
And though no counterparts of
Watts or Detroit have taken place
in urban areas where large
concentrations of Chicanos reside,
there is no mistaking that places
like El Paso, Texas; Denver,
Colorado; and Riverside,
California are seething with
frustration and discontent.
Many commentators on the
racial situation in America are
fond of making the comparison
between the passive Chicano and
ostensibly revolutionary-minded
segments of the black community;
yet at the same time that many
black militants were engaging in
revolutionary rhetoric, a vato by
the name of Reies Tijerina was
actually making revolution in
northern New Mexico last year.
A larger-scale example of the
Stanlord Almanac's "oversight" is
brought to light by the recent
resignation of the chairman of the
U.S. Inter-Agency Committee on
Mexican American Affairs in
protest to the disinterestedness
shown by representatives of some
of the nation's largest and most
prestigious foundations in funding
Chicano-developed proposals to
deal with problems in the barrios.
This only serves to reinforce the
views of many militant Chicanos
that no serious attention will be
payed the Mexican American until
East Los Angeles or El Paso are
left in rubble.

American problem" white
America appears to have learned

conscience of white America were
not sufficient to induce massive
injections of federal funds into
black ghettos. Watts was. What
will happen with Chicanos? Many
are waiting for a response from
the larger society that does not
appear to be forthcoming. Curas,
ese, it's time to make our move.
And so it was that the vatos in
MASC were not surprised at being
overlooked by the Alumni Journal

our views are inconsequential.

not surprised.

views concerning the state of
