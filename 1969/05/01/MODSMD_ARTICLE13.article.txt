# At The I-Center
## Smorgasbord Of Activities 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
The next best thing is taking a trip abroad is to
visit the Bechtel International Center. There is a
tremendous variety of programs that they offer, all
of them with a foreign flavour. Their programs are
well planned and designed to delight almost every
taste.
There are once a week "Luncheon discussion
groups" to bring together small groups of foreign
and American students, to enjoy informal
discussions over home-cooked meals. These
lunches are budget priced and the topics of
discussion are usually of great interest. "Current
event coffee hour" is another program meant to
exchange views on controversial subjects. This is a
very appropriate forum to discuss the events in
other countries with people who have first hand
knowledge.
"Saturday evening abroad" is the most
fascinating and perhaps the most popular of all the
programs. It gives an opportunity to the foreign
nationals to present the customs, costumes, films,
music, dance, and dishes of their countries to
anyone interested. Usually the American
attendance outnumbers the foreigners at these
evenings. The exotic South East Asian dances in
native costumes, Indian classical music, Pakastani
fashion show and Mexican Fiesta are some of the
highlights of this year's evening abroad programs.
A number of programs are intellectually
stimulating. International Film Forum presents
outstanding movies from many countries, followed
by discussion. This quarter it plans to show Italian,
Russian, French, Spanish and Swedish movies. For

those American students planning to join the
foreign service, the language (German, French,
Spanish, Japanese, etc.) discussion groups provide
an ideal opportunity to sharpen their linguistic
skills.
There also is an international folk night, once a
week, when one is entertained with live native and
foreign folk songs and music.
On those evenings when there is nothing special
going on in the I-Center, one still finds the homely
atmosphere, home made cookies, coffee
(sometimes wine or beer) and someone to talk to.
Besides usual programs, I-Center also has an
orientation program to welcome the new foreign
students. During the welcome week, the new
foreign students are introduced to the university
and the surrounding areas, they stay with local
families, they attend parties at private homes, and
are given informal talks on native customs etc.
This is perhaps the most imaginative program to
make the cultural shock as smooth as possible.
The main purpose of I-Center is to help develop
better understanding between American and
foreign students. Unfortunately American
response is lacking. Although a moderately good
number of American students participate in the
I-Center activities, there are very many who feel
that I-Center is only for foreigners only. This
mistaken view has been of considerable annoyance
to the I-Center administration. They are trying to
find out ways to attract more American students
to make I-Center a truly international meeting
place.

to make I-Center a truly international meeting
place.
The next best thing is taking a trip abroad is to
visit the Bechtel International Center. There is a
tremendous variety of programs that they offer, all
of them with a foreign flavour. Their programs are
well planned and designed to delight almost every
taste.
There are once a week "Luncheon discussion
groups" to bring together small groups of foreign
and American students, to enjoy informal
discussions over home-cooked meals. These
lunches are budget priced and the topics of
discussion are usually of great interest. "Current
event coffee hour" is another program meant to
exchange views on controversial subjects. This is a
very appropriate forum to discuss the events in
other countries with people who have first hand
knowledge.
"Saturday evening abroad" is the most
fascinating and perhaps the most popular of all the
programs. It gives an opportunity to the foreign
nationals to present the customs, costumes, films,
music, dance, and dishes of their countries to
anyone interested. Usually the American
attendance outnumbers the foreigners at these
evenings. The exotic South East Asian dances in
native costumes, Indian classical music, Pakastani
fashion show and Mexican Fiesta are some of the
highlights of this year's evening abroad programs.
A number of programs are intellectually
stimulating. International Film Forum presents
outstanding movies from many countries, followed
by discussion. This quarter it plans to show Italian,
Russian, French, Spanish and Swedish movies. For

those American students planning to join the
foreign service, the language (German, French,
Spanish, Japanese, etc.) discussion groups provide
an ideal opportunity to sharpen their linguistic
skills.
There also is an international folk night, once a
week, when one is entertained with live native and
foreign folk songs and music.
On those evenings when there is nothing special
going on in the I-Center, one still finds the homely
atmosphere, home made cookies, coffee
(sometimes wine or beer) and someone to talk to.
Besides usual programs, I-Center also has an
orientation program to welcome the new foreign
students. During the welcome week, the new
foreign students are introduced to the university
and the surrounding areas, they stay with local
families, they attend parties at private homes, and
are given informal talks on native customs etc.
This is perhaps the most imaginative program to
make the cultural shock as smooth as possible.
The main purpose of I-Center is to help develop
better understanding between American and
foreign students. Unfortunately American
response is lacking. Although a moderately good
number of American students participate in the
I-Center activities, there are very many who feel
that I-Center is only for foreigners only. This
mistaken view has been of considerable annoyance
to the I-Center administration. They are trying to
find out ways to attract more American students
to make I-Center a truly international meeting
place.
