# Black Drama
## Premiere In May 
### Carolyn Hatchett 
Earlier this year a play written
by one of the most sensitive and
talented Black writers at Stanford
University, Johnny Scott, was
rejected by the production staff
of the Stanford "Gaities."
Scott asked why?—why a play
that he had worked to create for
an entire summer under the
conception that it would be
produced in the fall, a play that
had been created and could only
have been conceived out of the
depths of a Black
ex p erience—would not be
performed. The only answer
Johnny Scott received was simply,
"It can't be done."
Scott, who is now Artistic
Director of the Stanford BSU,
along with other concerned Black
students, have been working
constantly to provide the medium
through which Black culture can
be expressed on the Stanford
campus. As a result of the BSU
demands made upon the
University last quarter, Black
students now have the beginnings
of an Afro-American Cultural
Center (whose present physical
location is most commonly
known as "The Black House")
which will hopefully fulfill the
desire of Johnny Scott and all
Black students.
From this base, research and
studies will be conducted by
Blacks themselves in an attempt
to uncover the true history of the
plight of Black people in America.
The Center will deal not only with
aspects of the past, but with
present cultural developments as
well.
The Black Drama Group, one

of the Center's top priorities to
date, is in the process of
producing three powerful plays:
"The Electronic Nigger," awarded
the Vernon Rice Award for the
best off-Broadway production in
New York this year; "A Son
Come Home,"—both written by
Ed Bullins, a Black playwright
from Harlem—and Joseph White's
"Ole Judge Mqse Is Dead."
The director of the plays is
John Cochran, former Black
Artist-in-Residence at CCSF who
will become Director-in-Residence
at Stanford this September.
Cochran, who plays the leading
role in "The Electronic Nigger" as
well as directs, has a history of
revolutionary contributions to
Black literature and his theatrical
experience is extensive. The rest
of the cast is made up of Black
students from the Stanford
community.
The Black Drama Group will
premiere the three plays, marking
their first presentation anywhere
on the west coast, here at
Stanford in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium on May 25, 26, 28,
and 29. Each play has a message
that the actors will truly be able
to feel and project; Black voices
will be dramatically lifted and
pure Black art will be heard.
For the first time here at
Stanford, Black actors and
actresses will be able to respond
when their director says to them,
"Try to forget you're acting and
put yourself into that role."
Johnny Scott has a new reply:
Black drama will be done.
