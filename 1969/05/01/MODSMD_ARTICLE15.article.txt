# Letters To The Editor
## No Consensus On SRI 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that, after
having published an accurate
account of the faculty and
student referendum on SHI and
related issues Tuesday morning,
the Daily on Wednesday morning
gave front page space to a news
analysis by Michael Sweeney
which contained some rather
serious errors. The most serious of
these is that there is not, contrary
to Mr. Sweeney's analysis, "... a
clear consensus on the future of
our research affiliate."
First of all, his interpretation
of the faculty data was simply
erroneous: the majority of faculty
favored one or another of the
"sell SHI" alternatives. Sweeney's
statement, "The consensus ... is
that SHI should not be sold and
that certain kinds of military
research should cease," does not
hold up in this case. For that
matter, the questionnaire did not
ask about ceasing research, but
restricting it—sentiments which
may be similar, but which are not
identical. The important
consensus among both faculty and
students was that SRI research
should be restricted. However, the
two groups differed markedly on
whether SHI should be kept or
separated from Stanford
University.
Finally, key Stanford staff and
alumni are currently being polled
on these issues, and a complete
measure of consensus in the
community should take into
account the views of the SRI
researchers and staff as well.

•Refuse The System
Editor, THE DAILY:
Frankly, I'm scared, and I'd be
lying to say I'm not. I'm going to
send back my draft card today,
and 1 might end up in jail.
One reason I'm scared is that I
was in the Army for two years,
and during that time I learned
how powerful and ruthless the
Army can be. If you displease it,

it will harass you. If you try to
buck it, it will smash you.
It thoroughly intimidated me
and therefore, naturally, I was an
uncommonly conscientious
soldier.
But I'm sending my card back
anyway because I've had it—with
the war, with American
imperialism and oppression, with
all those things that are only
words in so many people's minds
but that mean suffering and death
for so many others.
1 used to think it was possible
to change this oppressive system
from the inside, but I don't
anymore. The only way to change
this system is to refuse to serve it.
Carrying a draft card and a
deferment is one way of serving it,
and it is time to recognize that
fact and act on it.
It is also time to stop acting
out of fear, even if the fear is real,
because when we live in fear, it
doesn't really matter if our prison
has bars and walls around it or red
tile and palm trees.

•False Alarm?
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a member of the Stanford
Chapter of the SSPA, and as a
firm opponent of the ABM, I
would request Siegel ("Another
Liberal Project, Stanford Daily,
28 April) to divulge his source of
information which .ed him to
understand that over-the-horizon
radar (OTH) is "to be integral to
the development of an
anti-ballistic missile system." If
Siegel is wrong, which I believe is
the case, he is harming the
anti-ABM cause by:
(a) deflecting some of the
opposition away from the ABM
proper
(b) demonstrating ignorance
of the proposed ABM with a
resulting loss of credibility
The OTH radars are
independent of the ABM, since
whether the ABM is built or not,
OTH radars will continue to
perform their valuable function.

That function is to provide early
warning of an ICBM attack. OTH
radars, along with the older
Ballistic Missile Early Warning
System (BMEWS), and planned
satellite-borne missile warning
systems will provide both the first
warning and confirmation of an
ICBM attack. The OTH radars
and, I assume, the satellite
warning systems, provide the
earliest indication of an ICBM
launch since they can, for
example, "see" Soviet ICBM's as
they leave the atmosphere. (The
BMEWS does not detect the
missiles until later in their flight,
but does provide some early
tracking data.)
It is terribly important that
every possible means be used to
confirm that an attack is
underway. If only one warning
system were available, a false
launch indication, especially
during a period of international
tension, could lead to an
accidential nuclear exchange.
Thus, OTH radars are a stabilizing
factor and do indeed lead to
saving life. These are elementary
facts.
OTH radars will also
undoubtedly be utilized to alert
an active defense system, whether
it be the proposed ABM or some
future system. If this is what

Siegel refers to, then he is correct.
However, the existence, or
non-existence of OTH radars has
no bearing on the decision to
deploy (or, hopefully, scrap) the
Sentinel/Safeguard system. So let
us not be led astray;
over-the*horizon radars are not
the issue, stop ABM!

(a) deflecting some of the

proper
(b) demonstrating ignorance
of the proposed ABM with a
resulting loss of credibility
The OTH radars are
independent of the ABM, since
whether the ABM is built or not,
OTH radars will continue to
perform their valuable function.

That function is to provide early
warning of an ICBM attack. OTH
radars, along with the older
Ballistic Missile Early Warning
System (BMEWS), and planned
satellite-borne missile warning
systems will provide both the first
warning and confirmation of an
ICBM attack. The OTH radars
and, I assume, the satellite
warning systems, provide the
earliest indication of an ICBM
launch since they can, for
example, "see" Soviet ICBM's as
they leave the atmosphere. (The
BMEWS does not detect the
missiles until later in their flight,
but does provide some early
tracking data.)
It is terribly important that
every possible means be used to
confirm that an attack is
underway. If only one warning
system were available, a false
launch indication, especially
during a period of international
tension, could lead to an
accidential nuclear exchange.
Thus, OTH radars are a stabilizing
factor and do indeed lead to
saving life. These are elementary
facts.
OTH radars will also
undoubtedly be utilized to alert
an active defense system, whether
it be the proposed ABM or some
future system. If this is what

Siegel refers to, then he is correct.
However, the existence, or
non-existence of OTH radars has
no bearing on the decision to
deploy (or, hopefully, scrap) the
Sentinel/Safeguard system. So let
us not be led astray;
over-the*horizon radars are not
the issue, stop ABM!

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that, after
having published an accurate
account of the faculty and
student referendum on SHI and
related issues Tuesday morning,
the Daily on Wednesday morning
gave front page space to a news
analysis by Michael Sweeney
which contained some rather
serious errors. The most serious of
these is that there is not, contrary
to Mr. Sweeney's analysis, "... a
clear consensus on the future of
our research affiliate."
First of all, his interpretation
of the faculty data was simply
erroneous: the majority of faculty
favored one or another of the
"sell SHI" alternatives. Sweeney's
statement, "The consensus ... is
that SHI should not be sold and
that certain kinds of military
research should cease," does not
hold up in this case. For that
matter, the questionnaire did not
ask about ceasing research, but
restricting it—sentiments which
may be similar, but which are not
identical. The important
consensus among both faculty and
students was that SRI research
should be restricted. However, the
two groups differed markedly on
whether SHI should be kept or
separated from Stanford
University.
Finally, key Stanford staff and
alumni are currently being polled
on these issues, and a complete
measure of consensus in the
community should take into
account the views of the SRI
researchers and staff as well.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Frankly, I'm scared, and I'd be
lying to say I'm not. I'm going to
send back my draft card today,
and 1 might end up in jail.
One reason I'm scared is that I
was in the Army for two years,
and during that time I learned
how powerful and ruthless the
Army can be. If you displease it,

it will harass you. If you try to
buck it, it will smash you.
It thoroughly intimidated me
and therefore, naturally, I was an
uncommonly conscientious
soldier.
But I'm sending my card back
anyway because I've had it—with
the war, with American
imperialism and oppression, with
all those things that are only
words in so many people's minds
but that mean suffering and death
for so many others.
1 used to think it was possible
to change this oppressive system
from the inside, but I don't
anymore. The only way to change
this system is to refuse to serve it.
Carrying a draft card and a
deferment is one way of serving it,
and it is time to recognize that
fact and act on it.
It is also time to stop acting
out of fear, even if the fear is real,
because when we live in fear, it
doesn't really matter if our prison
has bars and walls around it or red

and 1 might end up in jail.
One reason I'm scared is that I
was in the Army for two years,
and during that time I learned
how powerful and ruthless the
Army can be. If you displease it,

it will harass you. If you try to
buck it, it will smash you.
It thoroughly intimidated me
and therefore, naturally, I was an
uncommonly conscientious
soldier.
But I'm sending my card back
anyway because I've had it—with
the war, with American
imperialism and oppression, with
all those things that are only
words in so many people's minds
but that mean suffering and death
for so many others.
1 used to think it was possible
to change this oppressive system
from the inside, but I don't
anymore. The only way to change
this system is to refuse to serve it.
Carrying a draft card and a
deferment is one way of serving it,
and it is time to recognize that
fact and act on it.
It is also time to stop acting
out of fear, even if the fear is real,
because when we live in fear, it
doesn't really matter if our prison
has bars and walls around it or red
tile and palm trees.

•False Alarm?
Editor, THE DAILY:
As a member of the Stanford
Chapter of the SSPA, and as a
firm opponent of the ABM, I
would request Siegel ("Another
Liberal Project, Stanford Daily,
28 April) to divulge his source of
information which .ed him to
understand that over-the-horizon
radar (OTH) is "to be integral to
the development of an
anti-ballistic missile system." If
Siegel is wrong, which I believe is
the case, he is harming the
anti-ABM cause by:
(a) deflecting some of the
opposition away from the ABM
proper
(b) demonstrating ignorance
of the proposed ABM with a
resulting loss of credibility
The OTH radars are
independent of the ABM, since
whether the ABM is built or not,
OTH radars will continue to
perform their valuable function.

That function is to provide early
warning of an ICBM attack. OTH
radars, along with the older
Ballistic Missile Early Warning
System (BMEWS), and planned
satellite-borne missile warning
systems will provide both the first
warning and confirmation of an
ICBM attack. The OTH radars
and, I assume, the satellite
warning systems, provide the
earliest indication of an ICBM
launch since they can, for
example, "see" Soviet ICBM's as
they leave the atmosphere. (The
BMEWS does not detect the
missiles until later in their flight,
but does provide some early
tracking data.)
It is terribly important that
every possible means be used to
confirm that an attack is
underway. If only one warning
system were available, a false
launch indication, especially
during a period of international
tension, could lead to an
accidential nuclear exchange.
Thus, OTH radars are a stabilizing
factor and do indeed lead to
saving life. These are elementary
facts.
OTH radars will also
undoubtedly be utilized to alert
an active defense system, whether
it be the proposed ABM or some
future system. If this is what

Siegel refers to, then he is correct.
However, the existence, or
non-existence of OTH radars has
no bearing on the decision to
deploy (or, hopefully, scrap) the
Sentinel/Safeguard system. So let
us not be led astray;
over-the*horizon radars are not
the issue, stop ABM!

Editor, THE DAILY:
It is unfortunate that, after
having published an accurate
account of the faculty and
student referendum on SHI and
related issues Tuesday morning,
the Daily on Wednesday morning
gave front page space to a news
analysis by Michael Sweeney
which contained some rather
serious errors. The most serious of
these is that there is not, contrary
to Mr. Sweeney's analysis, "... a
clear consensus on the future of
our research affiliate."
First of all, his interpretation
of the faculty data was simply
erroneous: the majority of faculty
favored one or another of the
"sell SHI" alternatives. Sweeney's
statement, "The consensus ... is
that SHI should not be sold and
that certain kinds of military
research should cease," does not
hold up in this case. For that
matter, the questionnaire did not
ask about ceasing research, but
restricting it—sentiments which
may be similar, but which are not
identical. The important
consensus among both faculty and
students was that SRI research
should be restricted. However, the
two groups differed markedly on
whether SHI should be kept or
separated from Stanford
University.
Finally, key Stanford staff and
alumni are currently being polled
on these issues, and a complete
measure of consensus in the
community should take into
account the views of the SRI
researchers and staff as well.
