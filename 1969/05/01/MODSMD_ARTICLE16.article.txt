Editor, THE DAILY:
The Senate, in response to a motion by Mr. Kennedy, gave §
unanimous consent for a reporter from the Stanford Daily to be |
present at its evening meeting on Tuesday, April 29. In telephone |
conversations between Mr. Sweeney of the Daily and two members §
of the Steering Committee of the Senate (Clebsch and Kennedy), it |
was agreed that the reporter was to be present for the exclusive |
purpose of obtaining background information, and would neither |
report votes and motions nor attribute quotes to Senate members. |
These understandings were a part of the motion for consent, and |
were agreed to at the beginning of the meeting by the Daily reporter. |
The conditions were thus fully known and accepted by the Daily |
staff before the April 30 issue was prepared. Under these |
circumstances, the Editor's letter on page 1 of the April 30 issue is |
both misleading and disturbing. In our opinion, this seriously |
jeopardizes an extension of the Senate's trust in the Daily.
