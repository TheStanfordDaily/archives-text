# Coalition Formed To Oppose 'Radicalism And Intimidation'
## 
### 
The Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC), a
newly-formed organization critical
of sit-ins and other disruptive
tactics, has elected its officers.
James Schneider, a junior in
psychology was chosen president,
and Eckhard Schultz, a graduate
in electrical engineering, was
chosen as vice-president. Both
Schneider and Schultz were
candidates in the recent ASSU
presidential elections.
One of its founders described
the group as "a non-partisan,
non -doc trinaire organization,
open to all responsible members
of the community, including
alumni.
"Someone has to create an
active, organized opposition to
campus radicalism and
intimidation. A university can
suffer disastrous consequences if
the minority, radical presence is

met only with apathetic inaction
of the majority. This must not be
allowed to happen," he said.
Schneider said that the
Coalition was op no sed to
"intimidation and coercion,"
placing tactics such as sit-ins and
picketing of Trustee homes in this
category. "We don't want to
ignore the issues, but we want to
create an atmosphere where issues
can best be solved," he added.
One of the Coalition's stated
primary objectives is to help
preserve amd maximize academic
and campus freedom.
The new Coalition is the
brainchild of Gilbert Diaz, Jr., a
senior in political science. It is an
outgrowth of the ad hoc
Committee of Concerned
Engineers and other supporters.
Thursday Diaz held a joint
student-faculty and staff meeting
at which he emphasized the

necessity of coordinating and
channeling the efforts of those
opposed to radicalism.
Jackson Booth, a political
science freshman and a CAC
founder, helped create the
organizational structure.
An important goal of the new
group, as stated in the CAC
Constitution, is to help reduce the
campus influence of radicalism,
which it views as very
irresponsible and disproportion
ate. This is to be achieved by
educating the Stanford
community to the "other" point
of view. The CAC is to combat
what Booth calls "the flood of
radical misrepresentation and
propaganda which, after years,
achieves a "Big-Lie effect." The
Stanford Daily is one media organ
indicated for a "serious imbalance
in its editorializing."
Diaz emphasized that the
organization is broadly-based and
should appeal to individuals of
varying but responsible
persuasions. It is to function not
solely during periods of crisis, he
said, but, rather, on a permanent
basis with long-range goals which
w ill help avert future crisis
development.
Officers were elected Monday
noon; that night the Executive
Board and the committee system
were established and began their
activities.
Tuesday morning Schneider,
Booth, and Diaz met with
President Pitzer in his office and
explained the goals of this
fledgling organization. Pitzer
welcomed CAC's formation and
encouraged it to stimulate the
"silent majority" into positive
action.
The CAC plans to contact
faculty Senate members, write
trustees, and prepare position
papers.
President Schneider called an
Executive Board meeting Tuesday
evening to consider immediate
plans and goals.

of the majority. This must not be
allowed to happen," he said.
Schneider said that the
Coalition was op no sed to
"intimidation and coercion,"
placing tactics such as sit-ins and
picketing of Trustee homes in this
category. "We don't want to
ignore the issues, but we want to
create an atmosphere where issues
can best be solved," he added.
One of the Coalition's stated
primary objectives is to help
preserve amd maximize academic
and campus freedom.
The new Coalition is the
brainchild of Gilbert Diaz, Jr., a
senior in political science. It is an
outgrowth of the ad hoc
Committee of Concerned
Engineers and other supporters.
Thursday Diaz held a joint
student-faculty and staff meeting
at which he emphasized the

necessity of coordinating and
channeling the efforts of those
opposed to radicalism.
Jackson Booth, a political
science freshman and a CAC
founder, helped create the
organizational structure.
An important goal of the new
group, as stated in the CAC
Constitution, is to help reduce the
campus influence of radicalism,
which it views as very
irresponsible and disproportion
ate. This is to be achieved by
educating the Stanford
community to the "other" point
of view. The CAC is to combat
what Booth calls "the flood of
radical misrepresentation and
propaganda which, after years,
achieves a "Big-Lie effect." The
Stanford Daily is one media organ
indicated for a "serious imbalance
in its editorializing."
Diaz emphasized that the
organization is broadly-based and
should appeal to individuals of
varying but responsible
persuasions. It is to function not
solely during periods of crisis, he
said, but, rather, on a permanent
basis with long-range goals which
w ill help avert future crisis
development.
Officers were elected Monday
noon; that night the Executive
Board and the committee system
were established and began their
activities.
Tuesday morning Schneider,
Booth, and Diaz met with
President Pitzer in his office and
explained the goals of this
fledgling organization. Pitzer
welcomed CAC's formation and
encouraged it to stimulate the
"silent majority" into positive
action.
The CAC plans to contact
faculty Senate members, write
trustees, and prepare position
papers.
President Schneider called an
Executive Board meeting Tuesday
evening to consider immediate
plans and goals.
The Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC), a
newly-formed organization critical
of sit-ins and other disruptive
tactics, has elected its officers.
James Schneider, a junior in
psychology was chosen president,
and Eckhard Schultz, a graduate
in electrical engineering, was
chosen as vice-president. Both
Schneider and Schultz were
candidates in the recent ASSU
presidential elections.
One of its founders described
the group as "a non-partisan,
non -doc trinaire organization,
open to all responsible members
of the community, including
alumni.
"Someone has to create an
active, organized opposition to
campus radicalism and
intimidation. A university can
suffer disastrous consequences if
the minority, radical presence is

met only with apathetic inaction
of the majority. This must not be
allowed to happen," he said.
