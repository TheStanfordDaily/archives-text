# Resistance Fire
## 
### 
A fire burned out the front living room of the
Resistance "Peace Center" early this morning.
There was "no evidence of arson" in the
small, green frame building at 424 Lytton
Ave. in Palo Alto according to a Palo Alto
fireman. Me also noted the building w?s
secure, and the blaze seemed "accidental."
