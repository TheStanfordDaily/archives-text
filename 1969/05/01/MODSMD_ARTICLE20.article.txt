# Computer Analysis
## SRI Poll Results Combined 
### ART HAGER 
Art Hager, a psychology major
who will graduate in June, did a
computer analysis of the results of
the recent SRI poll, combining
the separate percentages given by
the Maccoby committee for the
student and faculty votes in
several ways. This is his report on
his findings and their significance
in interpreting the overall results
of the poll.
The Maccoby committee
presented the results of the SRI
poll in the form of separate
percentages for the faculty and
students responding. Dr. W. Ray
Funkhouser, a member of the
polling committee, stated that the
committee felt the statistics
would be meaningless if combined
to give a composite view of the
Stanford community's opinion.
Since both faculty and student
opinion will be weighed together
in some manner before the final
decision on SRI is made, the poll's
results were combined in three
different ways for statistical
analysis.
The first combination assumed
that student opinion and faculty
opinion should be weighed
equally as groups, each
contributing 50% to the final
percentages. The second assumed
that each individual vote should
be equal in the final total.

The third combination began
with the realization that a number
of eligible voters were either
unable or unwilling to complete
their questionnaires. This final
analysis projected the student and
faculty percentages obtained to
the entire body of eligible voters
and considered those numbers on
a one-man one-vote basis.
Faculty More Conservative
The separate results for faculty
and students show that the
faculty took a generally more
conservative position on all of the
questions.
For example, 56.2% of the
students listed "integrating SRI
into the University" as one of the
three issues which were most
important to them, while only
30.1% of the faculty listed this
issue. Similarly, 68.8% of the
students and 54.0% of the faculty
listed "restricting certain types of
research done at SRI" as one of
the three most important issues.
When asked to rate as
acceptable or unacceptable a
number of alternatives concerning
the disposition of SRI, a small
majority of the faculty (44.6% to
40.5%) opposed selling SRI with
no restrictions, while on the same
question, students voted by a
ratio of four to one (70.1% to
17.6%) that such a sale was
unacceptable.

Both students and faculty
voted most strongly
acknowledging the acceptability
of retaining and controlling
(although the faculty favored sale
with restrictions as the best single
alternative on the last question),
but it was 76.7% of the students
who found this alternative
acceptable, while only a minority
of the faculty (47.1%) found this
an acceptable alternative.
Area Of Disagreement
The most significant area of
disagreement between the faculty
and students was in the final
question, which asked the
respondent to name the single
best proposal for the future of
SRI.
Both groups named retention
and control of SRI most strongly,
but student support was nearly
twice as strong as that from the
faculty (68.2% to 35.6%). The
greatest difference, however, came
in the totals of each group
supporting one of the three
varieties of sale (with controls and
non-profit, with controls and for
profit, and without controls). The
student total was only 18.2%,
while a majority of the faculty
(53.3%) supported one of these
three varieties of sale.
If the total faculty vote is
weighted equally with the student
vote, 51.9% of the Stanford
community favors retention and
control, while 35.75% favors one
of the varieties of sale.
Favorable Combination
This is the combination most
favorable to the faculty, as it
equates the votes of 671 faculty

members (10.6% of the total
votes) with the votes of 5671
students (89.4% of the total).
When the vote is considered in
a one-man, one-vote context,
64.75% of the total community
voting supports control, while
21.91% favor sale. If we take the
votes cast to be representative of
the entire groups, then the ratio
goes over three to one, with
65.35% of the community
supporting control, and only
21.27% favoring sale.
Even these percentages
favoring sale are split three ways.
Only 27.7% of the faculty could
agree on sale with no restrictions,
the most popular form of sale in
that group. Only 7.8% of the
students supported this form of
sale.
Combining the faculty and
student votes on an equal basis,
17.75% favor sale without
restrictions. If a one-man,
one-vote system is used, only
9.9% favor this type of sale, and if
the votes cast are considered to
represent the non-voters in each
group, only 9.5% favor sale
without restrictions. In all cases,
there is less support for the other
forms of sale.
On all scales, retention and
control received overwhelmingly
stronger support than any other
single proposal. Moreover, there
must be the most serious doubt
about the validity of adding
together the support of two such
antithetical proposals as selling
SRI with controls and selling it
without any restrictions.
