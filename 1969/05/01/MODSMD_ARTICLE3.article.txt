A blow-by-blow account of
yesterday's events:
Noon-April 3rd Movement meets in
Old Union courtyard and decides to let
SRI hearing proceed without disruption.
2 p.m. —SRI hearing begins in Meyer
Library. 1400 students watch on closed
circuit TV in Memorial Auditorium.
4:30- Doron Weinberg, a Movement
speaker at hearing, leads walkout and
calls Movement meeting outside
Memorial Auditorium.
5:00-6:45 p.m. —700 Movement
members debate course of action and
adjourn to meeting at 8:30 p.m. in
Tresidder.
9:50 —A crowd of 800 jammed into
Tresidder large lounge hears BSU
member Don Edwards move that a vote
be taken to sit-in at some location.
10:30—First confused vote shows
majority for sit-in. The house is
"divided" by persons walking to
different sides of room, according to
their vote. Meeting's Chairman, Marc
Sapir, announces 450-280 in favor of
sit-in.
1 0 : 4 5 — M ovement moves to

Dinkelspiel auditorium to choose a sit-in
target. Crowd swells to 900.
12:45 —Movement votes in favor of
occupying Encina Hall, instead of Space
Engineering Building and two other
sites.
1:05 —After brief scuffle with
right-wing students at the front door,
Movement breaks in glass doors and
occupies Encina.
1:30-Dean of Students Joel Smith
orders demonstrators to leave. After
quick tour, he leaves building.
2:oo—About 300 Movement
members begin general meeting on
second floor. Meeting decides to
"encourage" Payroll staff to continue
work; and to ban cameras from the
building to prevent identification of
demonstrators.
2:35 —Dean of Students Joel Smith
returns with about 20 faculty members
and tells the demonstrators they will be
suspended if they do not leave in 15
minutes. Demonstrators respond by
singing "Solidarity Forever" and
screaming, "Get out, Joel."

Statement of the Council of Presidents
An important part of the April 3
Movement died last night. The cohering
principles of community decision and
non-violence were substantially left
behind.
Last night's decision to sit-in,
achieved in an atmosphere ruled by
emotion, is of an entirely different
nature and different purpose than the
last one; and will probably end with
harmful results—destructive to the
purposes of the original demands. This
sit-in jeopardizes and most probably
eliminates the possibility
(1) of substantive action by the
Academic Senate on Thursday based on
the groundwork of their Tuesday
meeting,
(2) of the vitally important meeting
planned for Thursday between SRI
employees, Stanford faculty, and
students,
(3) of the planned Friday meeting
between a San Francisco CPA firm and
a Trustee which was to discuss the
feasibility of a professional study
concerning closer ties between Stanford
and SRI. The proposal of bringing SRI
closer to the University cannot and will
not be adopted without the results of
such a study.
We deplore the provocative action
taken by some counterdemonstrators
toward the Movement upon its arrival at
Encina Hall.
However, we cannot support a sit-in
which we view as counter-productive.
And we urge others not to.
