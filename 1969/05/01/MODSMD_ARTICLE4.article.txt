# Students Stage Walkout At Trustee Hearing In UGLY
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Members of the April Third
Movement walked out of the
long-awaited and much-maligned
Trustees' hearing on the future of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
yesterday in the Meyer Library forum
room as a full house watched the
proceedings in Memorial Auditorium.
The walkout, accompanied by a
similar exodus at Mem Aud, came after
law student Doron Weinberg, the last
scheduled student speaker, demanded
that the trustees say what standards
they would use in deciding on the SRI
issue.
Following the ground rules of the
hearing, which the Board drew up and
repeatedly refused to change, the
trustees refused to answer Weinberg's
question.
Those who left the hearing joined
others from Mem Aud for a meeting
outside of the auditorium to discuss
tactics.
Weinberg had declared that the idea
of a restrictive covenant in selling SRI
"is fatuous—it's a joke, it's a bribe, and
even a hoax."
"A university has no business making
money," he told the trustees. "A
university should be struggling, I don't
think you understand that."
Fifteen students, five faculty
members, and four SRI administrators
addressed the panel of five trustees:
Morris M Doyle, Richard E.
Guggenhime, William R. Hewlett, Mrs.
Allan E. Charles, and Dean A. Watkins.
The SRI administrators were first to
speak, and devoted most of their hour
to describing many of the institute's
projects they consider beneficial, such
as urban transportation, laser surgery,
and organ transplants.
Also discussed was the importance of

SRI and the feeling of its staff.
"The organization is so complex and
so interdependent that one cannot talk
of snipping off a segment here or there
without seriously impairing the entire
institute," Charles Anderson, president
of SRI, said in his opening remarks.
"A mechanism of this complexity
and delicacy cannot stand much outside
tinkering . . . After hearing the diversity
of the work possible in this kind of
organization, you might agree with me
that if SRI did not exist today, there
would be strong pressure to create it."
Later, Anderson added, "The men
and women of SRI are dedicated
scientists and professionals, active and
socially constructive members of the
community. They have been terribly
maligned in the past few weeks ..."
"The staff of SRI is hurt and
dismayed, and I share their sense of
frustration ... A great many of our
scientific and professional staff
members will not work under outside
restraints. Obviously, the departure of
any significant numloer of these research
personnel would mean the virtual death
of SRI," he said.
Wide Spectrum
Both sides of the question were
presented by the group of students, as
representatives of organizations covering
the entire political spectrum—from SDS,
the Resistance, and the Third World
Liberation Front to the Young
Republicans and Young Americans for
Freedom—spoke at the meeting.
Before the scheduled speakers
addressed the hearing, .John Wooten,
graduate business student, read a
statement for the ASSU Nominations
Committee, expressing the group's
"dismay at having to select such a small
group," and said that "all future
meetings of this sort must be

completely open."
Most of the students supported the
April Third Movement's demands.
"There is very clearly a conflict of
interest between the Board of Trustees
and the students on this issue,"
commented Paul Rupert, a member of
the Resistance and United Campus
Ministry.
"It is my hope we can resolve this
conflict peacefully. But the reason we
disagree is that we have very great
conflicts in world view . . . The role of
the University should be a critical role.
We should not have SRI and the
University aiding military policy. The
question of counterinsurgency is a clear
matter of urgency to us."
Additional Demands
Two members of the Third World
Liberation Front, David Edwards and
Neal Okabayashi, blasted the Trustees
and made ten demands on them.
"We are here to confront you,"
Okabayashi said. "It is you and people
like you who have set the scene for the
barbaric and inhumane scene in the
Third World today. We point an
accusing finger at you."
"A lot of people in this room base
their argument on mooralism," Edwards
noted. "I just cannot see any morality
in the richest nation in the world,
probably the greatest nation that has
ever come into this world, using almost
all its resources to kill people in North
Vietnam."
The demands they presented
included stopping all counterinsurgency
and chemical-biological warfare research
presently being conducted at SRI,
closing down SRI counterinsurgency
operations in Thailand, ending SRI
work in electronic warfare, closing the
international branch of SRI, bringing
SRI under closer control of the

University, and establishing a board to
review SRI research which would
include a significant number of Third
World people.
Other Side
On the other side was YAF President
Harvey Hukari. "The attack on SRI is
not merely an attack on the institute
iLself but on capitalism, Stanford
University, U.S. foreign policy, and the
Board of Trustees itself," he said.
"To speak in favor of CBW and
counterinsurgency research is to place
yourself in a position of being called a
heretic, even immoral," Hukari added.
"But I believe CBW work is important
and vital.
"Any restriction which stops the free
pursuit of knowledge is inherently
immoral. Researchers have the right to
determine whether or not their work is
immoral."
Faculty Speaks
Faculty speakers included two
members of the student-faculty
committee on SRl—Kenneth Scott, its
chairman, and Ezra Solomon.
Commenting on the nature of SRI,
Scott said he "did not believe that this
business could be successfully operated
by a student-faculty committee out to
reject any contracts its members felt
were 'morally undesirable' or not of
'optimum social value,' and it could be a
painfully expensive experiment to try
when the overhead rate is a million and
a quarter dollars per week."
He added that the Trustees' "duty to
maximize the value of the trust
investments likewise runs as well to the
future beneficiaries of this institution,
and the Trustees arc not relieved of that
duty by the wishes of the moment . . .
"They have a legal—and moral, if you
like —duty not to destroy a portion of
the University's trust assets at the

request of some number or even a
majority of the present beneficiaries of
that trust, rejecting forever the claims
(and quite possibly, the differing value
judgments) of those yet to come."
Selling SRI
Scott concluded that "the choice
then comes down to selling SRI for its
full value and using the proceeds to
further education, and the kinds of
research needed by our society, at the
University, or diverting part of the
University's existing resources to pay
for research at SRI."
"It does not seem to me that this
choice is in principle a difficult one to
make. Certainly it is not a difficult one
to assess from the standpoint of the
University, and that is the standpoint
which this community should realize
the Trustees are legally required by
virtue of their office to adopt."
WolfgjJng Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, had
a different approach to the problem.
''I consider the University
community at large to be poorly
informed about the actual workings of
SRI and thus many of the discussions
on the reorientation of the goals of SRI
have little substance," he said.
"I do believe, however ... it would
be worthwhile to take a hard look at the
possibility of rededicating SRI towards
non-military goals as an important pilot
experiment."
Panofsky added he felt that "our
current national priorities are
distorted—we are overcommitted to
military pursuits and undercommitted
to the solution of our internal
environmental and urban problems,"
and then made a series of
recommendations.
He asked that "the possibility be

explored to dedicate SRI to the solution
of the broad needs of our society caused
by the burgeoning population on this
globe," and that no move be made to
separate SRI until such a study is
completed.
He suggested such a study be
undertaken during the summer, and
include "heavy representation of SRI
personnel of various administrative
levels in addition to Stanford students,
faculty, administrators, and trustees."
The study, he urged, "should either
lead to a clearly feasible plan for
constructive dedication of SRI to
civilian goals, or lead to steps to
separate SRI from the University."
Earlier, Anderson sharply attacked
the "arrogant suggestion that a small
group that does not represent a majority
viewpoint should rule on the moral
acceptability of research."
He said he was "indignant, then
incredulous" that the SRI committee's
suggestion for creating a research review
committee was being taken seriously.
"My concern has since deepened," he
added.
"The majority does not condone
thought control," he noted. "What
disturbs me is that a tiny fraction of our
society, through demonstrations, sit-ins
and harangues of half-truths and
misrepresentations can so flout the
rights of others and so disrupt the
orderly workings of our community.
Objective research cannot be carried out
under outside and restrictive controls,
moral or financial, from whatever
source."

"We are here to confront you,"
Okabayashi said. "It is you and people
like you who have set the scene for the
barbaric and inhumane scene in the
Third World today. We point an
accusing finger at you."
"A lot of people in this room base
their argument on mooralism," Edwards
noted. "I just cannot see any morality
in the richest nation in the world,
probably the greatest nation that has
ever come into this world, using almost
all its resources to kill people in North
Vietnam."
The demands they presented
included stopping all counterinsurgency
and chemical-biological warfare research
presently being conducted at SRI,
closing down SRI counterinsurgency
operations in Thailand, ending SRI
work in electronic warfare, closing the
international branch of SRI, bringing
SRI under closer control of the

University, and establishing a board to
review SRI research which would
include a significant number of Third
World people.
Other Side
On the other side was YAF President
Harvey Hukari. "The attack on SRI is
not merely an attack on the institute
iLself but on capitalism, Stanford
University, U.S. foreign policy, and the
Board of Trustees itself," he said.
"To speak in favor of CBW and
counterinsurgency research is to place
yourself in a position of being called a
heretic, even immoral," Hukari added.
"But I believe CBW work is important
and vital.
"Any restriction which stops the free
pursuit of knowledge is inherently
immoral. Researchers have the right to
determine whether or not their work is
immoral."
Faculty Speaks
Faculty speakers included two
members of the student-faculty
committee on SRl—Kenneth Scott, its
chairman, and Ezra Solomon.
Commenting on the nature of SRI,
Scott said he "did not believe that this
business could be successfully operated
by a student-faculty committee out to
reject any contracts its members felt
were 'morally undesirable' or not of
'optimum social value,' and it could be a
painfully expensive experiment to try
when the overhead rate is a million and
a quarter dollars per week."
He added that the Trustees' "duty to
maximize the value of the trust
investments likewise runs as well to the
future beneficiaries of this institution,
and the Trustees arc not relieved of that
duty by the wishes of the moment . . .
"They have a legal—and moral, if you
like —duty not to destroy a portion of
the University's trust assets at the

request of some number or even a
majority of the present beneficiaries of
that trust, rejecting forever the claims
(and quite possibly, the differing value
judgments) of those yet to come."
Selling SRI
Scott concluded that "the choice
then comes down to selling SRI for its
full value and using the proceeds to
further education, and the kinds of
research needed by our society, at the
University, or diverting part of the
University's existing resources to pay
for research at SRI."
"It does not seem to me that this
choice is in principle a difficult one to
make. Certainly it is not a difficult one
to assess from the standpoint of the
University, and that is the standpoint
which this community should realize
the Trustees are legally required by
virtue of their office to adopt."
WolfgjJng Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, had
a different approach to the problem.
''I consider the University
community at large to be poorly
informed about the actual workings of
SRI and thus many of the discussions
on the reorientation of the goals of SRI
have little substance," he said.
"I do believe, however ... it would
be worthwhile to take a hard look at the
possibility of rededicating SRI towards
non-military goals as an important pilot
experiment."
Panofsky added he felt that "our
current national priorities are
distorted—we are overcommitted to
military pursuits and undercommitted
to the solution of our internal
environmental and urban problems,"
and then made a series of
recommendations.
He asked that "the possibility be

explored to dedicate SRI to the solution
of the broad needs of our society caused
by the burgeoning population on this
globe," and that no move be made to
separate SRI until such a study is
completed.
He suggested such a study be
undertaken during the summer, and
include "heavy representation of SRI
personnel of various administrative
levels in addition to Stanford students,
faculty, administrators, and trustees."
The study, he urged, "should either
lead to a clearly feasible plan for
constructive dedication of SRI to
civilian goals, or lead to steps to
separate SRI from the University."
Earlier, Anderson sharply attacked
the "arrogant suggestion that a small
group that does not represent a majority
viewpoint should rule on the moral
acceptability of research."
He said he was "indignant, then
incredulous" that the SRI committee's
suggestion for creating a research review
committee was being taken seriously.
"My concern has since deepened," he
added.
"The majority does not condone
thought control," he noted. "What
disturbs me is that a tiny fraction of our
society, through demonstrations, sit-ins
and harangues of half-truths and
misrepresentations can so flout the
rights of others and so disrupt the
orderly workings of our community.
Objective research cannot be carried out
under outside and restrictive controls,
moral or financial, from whatever
source."
Ed. Note: A second article on the
Trustee hearing, including statements by
students Michael Kuhl, David Jones,
Gilbert Diaz, and John Walkup, will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.)
Members of the April Third
Movement walked out of the
long-awaited and much-maligned
Trustees' hearing on the future of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
yesterday in the Meyer Library forum
room as a full house watched the
proceedings in Memorial Auditorium.
The walkout, accompanied by a
similar exodus at Mem Aud, came after
law student Doron Weinberg, the last
scheduled student speaker, demanded
that the trustees say what standards
they would use in deciding on the SRI
issue.
Following the ground rules of the
hearing, which the Board drew up and
repeatedly refused to change, the
trustees refused to answer Weinberg's
question.
Those who left the hearing joined
others from Mem Aud for a meeting
outside of the auditorium to discuss
tactics.
Weinberg had declared that the idea
of a restrictive covenant in selling SRI
"is fatuous—it's a joke, it's a bribe, and
even a hoax."
"A university has no business making
money," he told the trustees. "A
university should be struggling, I don't
think you understand that."
Fifteen students, five faculty
members, and four SRI administrators
addressed the panel of five trustees:
Morris M Doyle, Richard E.
Guggenhime, William R. Hewlett, Mrs.
Allan E. Charles, and Dean A. Watkins.
The SRI administrators were first to
speak, and devoted most of their hour
to describing many of the institute's
projects they consider beneficial, such
as urban transportation, laser surgery,
and organ transplants.
Also discussed was the importance of

SRI and the feeling of its staff.
"The organization is so complex and
so interdependent that one cannot talk
of snipping off a segment here or there
without seriously impairing the entire
institute," Charles Anderson, president
of SRI, said in his opening remarks.
"A mechanism of this complexity
and delicacy cannot stand much outside
tinkering . . . After hearing the diversity
of the work possible in this kind of
organization, you might agree with me
that if SRI did not exist today, there
would be strong pressure to create it."
Later, Anderson added, "The men
and women of SRI are dedicated
scientists and professionals, active and
socially constructive members of the
community. They have been terribly
maligned in the past few weeks ..."
"The staff of SRI is hurt and
dismayed, and I share their sense of
frustration ... A great many of our
scientific and professional staff
members will not work under outside
restraints. Obviously, the departure of
any significant numloer of these research
personnel would mean the virtual death
of SRI," he said.
Wide Spectrum
Both sides of the question were
presented by the group of students, as
representatives of organizations covering
the entire political spectrum—from SDS,
the Resistance, and the Third World
Liberation Front to the Young
Republicans and Young Americans for
Freedom—spoke at the meeting.
Before the scheduled speakers
addressed the hearing, .John Wooten,
graduate business student, read a
statement for the ASSU Nominations
Committee, expressing the group's
"dismay at having to select such a small
group," and said that "all future
meetings of this sort must be

completely open."
Most of the students supported the
April Third Movement's demands.
"There is very clearly a conflict of
interest between the Board of Trustees
and the students on this issue,"
commented Paul Rupert, a member of
the Resistance and United Campus
Ministry.
"It is my hope we can resolve this
conflict peacefully. But the reason we
disagree is that we have very great
conflicts in world view . . . The role of
the University should be a critical role.
We should not have SRI and the
University aiding military policy. The
question of counterinsurgency is a clear
matter of urgency to us."
Additional Demands
Two members of the Third World
Liberation Front, David Edwards and
Neal Okabayashi, blasted the Trustees
and made ten demands on them.
"We are here to confront you,"
Okabayashi said. "It is you and people

recommendations.
He asked that "the possibility be

explored to dedicate SRI to the solution
of the broad needs of our society caused
by the burgeoning population on this
globe," and that no move be made to
separate SRI until such a study is
completed.
He suggested such a study be
undertaken during the summer, and
include "heavy representation of SRI
personnel of various administrative
levels in addition to Stanford students,
faculty, administrators, and trustees."
The study, he urged, "should either
lead to a clearly feasible plan for
constructive dedication of SRI to
civilian goals, or lead to steps to
separate SRI from the University."
Earlier, Anderson sharply attacked
the "arrogant suggestion that a small
group that does not represent a majority
viewpoint should rule on the moral
acceptability of research."
He said he was "indignant, then
incredulous" that the SRI committee's
suggestion for creating a research review
committee was being taken seriously.
"My concern has since deepened," he
added.
"The majority does not condone
thought control," he noted. "What
disturbs me is that a tiny fraction of our
society, through demonstrations, sit-ins
and harangues of half-truths and
misrepresentations can so flout the
rights of others and so disrupt the
orderly workings of our community.
Objective research cannot be carried out
under outside and restrictive controls,
moral or financial, from whatever
source."

Trustee hearing, including statements by
students Michael Kuhl, David Jones,
Gilbert Diaz, and John Walkup, will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.)
Members of the April Third
Movement walked out of the
long-awaited and much-maligned
Trustees' hearing on the future of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
yesterday in the Meyer Library forum
room as a full house watched the
proceedings in Memorial Auditorium.
The walkout, accompanied by a
similar exodus at Mem Aud, came after
law student Doron Weinberg, the last
scheduled student speaker, demanded
that the trustees say what standards
they would use in deciding on the SRI
issue.
Following the ground rules of the
hearing, which the Board drew up and
repeatedly refused to change, the
trustees refused to answer Weinberg's
question.
Those who left the hearing joined
others from Mem Aud for a meeting
outside of the auditorium to discuss
tactics.
Weinberg had declared that the idea
of a restrictive covenant in selling SRI
"is fatuous—it's a joke, it's a bribe, and
even a hoax."
"A university has no business making
money," he told the trustees. "A
university should be struggling, I don't
think you understand that."
Fifteen students, five faculty
members, and four SRI administrators
addressed the panel of five trustees:
Morris M Doyle, Richard E.
Guggenhime, William R. Hewlett, Mrs.
Allan E. Charles, and Dean A. Watkins.
The SRI administrators were first to
speak, and devoted most of their hour
to describing many of the institute's
projects they consider beneficial, such
as urban transportation, laser surgery,
and organ transplants.
Also discussed was the importance of

SRI and the feeling of its staff.
"The organization is so complex and
so interdependent that one cannot talk
of snipping off a segment here or there
without seriously impairing the entire
institute," Charles Anderson, president
of SRI, said in his opening remarks.
"A mechanism of this complexity
and delicacy cannot stand much outside
tinkering . . . After hearing the diversity
of the work possible in this kind of
organization, you might agree with me
that if SRI did not exist today, there
would be strong pressure to create it."
Later, Anderson added, "The men
and women of SRI are dedicated
scientists and professionals, active and
socially constructive members of the
community. They have been terribly
maligned in the past few weeks ..."
"The staff of SRI is hurt and
dismayed, and I share their sense of
frustration ... A great many of our
scientific and professional staff
members will not work under outside
restraints. Obviously, the departure of
any significant numloer of these research
personnel would mean the virtual death
of SRI," he said.
Wide Spectrum
Both sides of the question were
presented by the group of students, as
representatives of organizations covering
the entire political spectrum—from SDS,
the Resistance, and the Third World
Liberation Front to the Young
Republicans and Young Americans for
Freedom—spoke at the meeting.
Before the scheduled speakers
addressed the hearing, .John Wooten,
graduate business student, read a
statement for the ASSU Nominations
Committee, expressing the group's
"dismay at having to select such a small
group," and said that "all future
meetings of this sort must be

completely open."
Most of the students supported the
April Third Movement's demands.
"There is very clearly a conflict of
interest between the Board of Trustees
and the students on this issue,"
commented Paul Rupert, a member of
the Resistance and United Campus
Ministry.
"It is my hope we can resolve this
conflict peacefully. But the reason we
disagree is that we have very great
conflicts in world view . . . The role of
the University should be a critical role.
We should not have SRI and the
University aiding military policy. The
question of counterinsurgency is a clear
matter of urgency to us."
Additional Demands
Two members of the Third World
Liberation Front, David Edwards and
Neal Okabayashi, blasted the Trustees
and made ten demands on them.
"We are here to confront you,"
Okabayashi said. "It is you and people
like you who have set the scene for the
barbaric and inhumane scene in the
Third World today. We point an
accusing finger at you."
"A lot of people in this room base
their argument on mooralism," Edwards
noted. "I just cannot see any morality
in the richest nation in the world,
probably the greatest nation that has
ever come into this world, using almost
all its resources to kill people in North
Vietnam."
The demands they presented
included stopping all counterinsurgency
and chemical-biological warfare research
presently being conducted at SRI,
closing down SRI counterinsurgency
operations in Thailand, ending SRI
work in electronic warfare, closing the
international branch of SRI, bringing
SRI under closer control of the

University, and establishing a board to
review SRI research which would
include a significant number of Third
World people.
Other Side
On the other side was YAF President
Harvey Hukari. "The attack on SRI is
not merely an attack on the institute
iLself but on capitalism, Stanford
University, U.S. foreign policy, and the
Board of Trustees itself," he said.
"To speak in favor of CBW and
counterinsurgency research is to place
yourself in a position of being called a
heretic, even immoral," Hukari added.
"But I believe CBW work is important
and vital.
"Any restriction which stops the free
pursuit of knowledge is inherently
immoral. Researchers have the right to
determine whether or not their work is
immoral."
Faculty Speaks
Faculty speakers included two
members of the student-faculty
committee on SRl—Kenneth Scott, its
chairman, and Ezra Solomon.
Commenting on the nature of SRI,
Scott said he "did not believe that this
business could be successfully operated
by a student-faculty committee out to
reject any contracts its members felt
were 'morally undesirable' or not of
'optimum social value,' and it could be a
painfully expensive experiment to try
when the overhead rate is a million and
a quarter dollars per week."
He added that the Trustees' "duty to
maximize the value of the trust
investments likewise runs as well to the
future beneficiaries of this institution,
and the Trustees arc not relieved of that
duty by the wishes of the moment . . .
"They have a legal—and moral, if you
like —duty not to destroy a portion of
the University's trust assets at the

request of some number or even a
majority of the present beneficiaries of
that trust, rejecting forever the claims
(and quite possibly, the differing value
judgments) of those yet to come."
Selling SRI
Scott concluded that "the choice
then comes down to selling SRI for its
full value and using the proceeds to
further education, and the kinds of
research needed by our society, at the
University, or diverting part of the
University's existing resources to pay
for research at SRI."
"It does not seem to me that this
choice is in principle a difficult one to
make. Certainly it is not a difficult one
to assess from the standpoint of the
University, and that is the standpoint
which this community should realize
the Trustees are legally required by
virtue of their office to adopt."
WolfgjJng Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, had
a different approach to the problem.
''I consider the University
community at large to be poorly
informed about the actual workings of
SRI and thus many of the discussions
on the reorientation of the goals of SRI
have little substance," he said.
"I do believe, however ... it would
be worthwhile to take a hard look at the
possibility of rededicating SRI towards
non-military goals as an important pilot
experiment."
Panofsky added he felt that "our
current national priorities are
distorted—we are overcommitted to
military pursuits and undercommitted
to the solution of our internal
environmental and urban problems,"
and then made a series of
recommendations.
He asked that "the possibility be

explored to dedicate SRI to the solution
of the broad needs of our society caused
by the burgeoning population on this
globe," and that no move be made to
separate SRI until such a study is
completed.
He suggested such a study be

frustration ... A great many of our
scientific and professional staff
members will not work under outside
restraints. Obviously, the departure of
any significant numloer of these research
personnel would mean the virtual death
of SRI," he said.
Wide Spectrum
Both sides of the question were
presented by the group of students, as
representatives of organizations covering
the entire political spectrum—from SDS,
the Resistance, and the Third World
Liberation Front to the Young
Republicans and Young Americans for
Freedom—spoke at the meeting.
Before the scheduled speakers
addressed the hearing, .John Wooten,
graduate business student, read a
statement for the ASSU Nominations
Committee, expressing the group's
"dismay at having to select such a small
group," and said that "all future
meetings of this sort must be

completely open."
Most of the students supported the
April Third Movement's demands.
"There is very clearly a conflict of
interest between the Board of Trustees
and the students on this issue,"
commented Paul Rupert, a member of
the Resistance and United Campus
Ministry.
"It is my hope we can resolve this
conflict peacefully. But the reason we
disagree is that we have very great
conflicts in world view . . . The role of
the University should be a critical role.
We should not have SRI and the
University aiding military policy. The
question of counterinsurgency is a clear
matter of urgency to us."
Additional Demands
Two members of the Third World
Liberation Front, David Edwards and
Neal Okabayashi, blasted the Trustees
and made ten demands on them.
"We are here to confront you,"
Okabayashi said. "It is you and people
like you who have set the scene for the
barbaric and inhumane scene in the
Third World today. We point an
accusing finger at you."
"A lot of people in this room base
their argument on mooralism," Edwards
noted. "I just cannot see any morality
in the richest nation in the world,
probably the greatest nation that has
ever come into this world, using almost
all its resources to kill people in North
Vietnam."
The demands they presented
included stopping all counterinsurgency
and chemical-biological warfare research
presently being conducted at SRI,
closing down SRI counterinsurgency
operations in Thailand, ending SRI
work in electronic warfare, closing the
international branch of SRI, bringing
SRI under closer control of the

University, and establishing a board to
review SRI research which would
include a significant number of Third
World people.
Other Side
On the other side was YAF President
Harvey Hukari. "The attack on SRI is
not merely an attack on the institute
iLself but on capitalism, Stanford
University, U.S. foreign policy, and the
Board of Trustees itself," he said.
"To speak in favor of CBW and
counterinsurgency research is to place
yourself in a position of being called a
heretic, even immoral," Hukari added.
"But I believe CBW work is important
and vital.
"Any restriction which stops the free
pursuit of knowledge is inherently
immoral. Researchers have the right to
determine whether or not their work is
immoral."
Faculty Speaks
Faculty speakers included two
members of the student-faculty
committee on SRl—Kenneth Scott, its
chairman, and Ezra Solomon.
Commenting on the nature of SRI,
Scott said he "did not believe that this
business could be successfully operated
by a student-faculty committee out to
reject any contracts its members felt
were 'morally undesirable' or not of
'optimum social value,' and it could be a
painfully expensive experiment to try
when the overhead rate is a million and
a quarter dollars per week."
He added that the Trustees' "duty to
maximize the value of the trust
investments likewise runs as well to the
future beneficiaries of this institution,
and the Trustees arc not relieved of that
duty by the wishes of the moment . . .
"They have a legal—and moral, if you
like —duty not to destroy a portion of
the University's trust assets at the

request of some number or even a
majority of the present beneficiaries of
that trust, rejecting forever the claims
(and quite possibly, the differing value
judgments) of those yet to come."
Selling SRI
Scott concluded that "the choice
then comes down to selling SRI for its
full value and using the proceeds to
further education, and the kinds of
research needed by our society, at the
University, or diverting part of the
University's existing resources to pay
for research at SRI."
"It does not seem to me that this
choice is in principle a difficult one to
make. Certainly it is not a difficult one
to assess from the standpoint of the
University, and that is the standpoint
which this community should realize
the Trustees are legally required by
virtue of their office to adopt."
WolfgjJng Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, had
a different approach to the problem.
''I consider the University
community at large to be poorly
informed about the actual workings of
SRI and thus many of the discussions
on the reorientation of the goals of SRI
have little substance," he said.
"I do believe, however ... it would
be worthwhile to take a hard look at the
possibility of rededicating SRI towards
non-military goals as an important pilot
experiment."
Panofsky added he felt that "our
current national priorities are
distorted—we are overcommitted to
military pursuits and undercommitted
to the solution of our internal
environmental and urban problems,"
and then made a series of
recommendations.
He asked that "the possibility be

explored to dedicate SRI to the solution
of the broad needs of our society caused
by the burgeoning population on this
globe," and that no move be made to
separate SRI until such a study is
completed.
He suggested such a study be
undertaken during the summer, and
include "heavy representation of SRI
personnel of various administrative
levels in addition to Stanford students,
faculty, administrators, and trustees."
The study, he urged, "should either
lead to a clearly feasible plan for
constructive dedication of SRI to
civilian goals, or lead to steps to
separate SRI from the University."
Earlier, Anderson sharply attacked
the "arrogant suggestion that a small
group that does not represent a majority
viewpoint should rule on the moral
acceptability of research."
He said he was "indignant, then
incredulous" that the SRI committee's
suggestion for creating a research review
committee was being taken seriously.
"My concern has since deepened," he
added.
"The majority does not condone
thought control," he noted. "What
disturbs me is that a tiny fraction of our
society, through demonstrations, sit-ins
and harangues of half-truths and
misrepresentations can so flout the
rights of others and so disrupt the
orderly workings of our community.
Objective research cannot be carried out
under outside and restrictive controls,
moral or financial, from whatever
source."
Ed. Note: A second article on the
Trustee hearing, including statements by
students Michael Kuhl, David Jones,
Gilbert Diaz, and John Walkup, will
appear in tomorrow's Daily.)
Members of the April Third
Movement walked out of the
long-awaited and much-maligned
Trustees' hearing on the future of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
yesterday in the Meyer Library forum
room as a full house watched the
proceedings in Memorial Auditorium.
The walkout, accompanied by a
similar exodus at Mem Aud, came after
law student Doron Weinberg, the last
scheduled student speaker, demanded
that the trustees say what standards
they would use in deciding on the SRI
issue.
Following the ground rules of the
hearing, which the Board drew up and
repeatedly refused to change, the
trustees refused to answer Weinberg's
question.
Those who left the hearing joined
others from Mem Aud for a meeting
outside of the auditorium to discuss
tactics.
Weinberg had declared that the idea
of a restrictive covenant in selling SRI
"is fatuous—it's a joke, it's a bribe, and
even a hoax."
"A university has no business making
money," he told the trustees. "A
university should be struggling, I don't
think you understand that."
Fifteen students, five faculty
members, and four SRI administrators
addressed the panel of five trustees:
Morris M Doyle, Richard E.
Guggenhime, William R. Hewlett, Mrs.
Allan E. Charles, and Dean A. Watkins.
The SRI administrators were first to
speak, and devoted most of their hour
to describing many of the institute's
projects they consider beneficial, such
as urban transportation, laser surgery,
and organ transplants.
Also discussed was the importance of

SRI and the feeling of its staff.
"The organization is so complex and
so interdependent that one cannot talk
of snipping off a segment here or there
without seriously impairing the entire
institute," Charles Anderson, president
of SRI, said in his opening remarks.
"A mechanism of this complexity
and delicacy cannot stand much outside
tinkering . . . After hearing the diversity
of the work possible in this kind of
organization, you might agree with me
that if SRI did not exist today, there
would be strong pressure to create it."
Later, Anderson added, "The men
and women of SRI are dedicated
scientists and professionals, active and
socially constructive members of the
community. They have been terribly
maligned in the past few weeks ..."
"The staff of SRI is hurt and
dismayed, and I share their sense of
frustration ... A great many of our
scientific and professional staff
members will not work under outside
restraints. Obviously, the departure of
any significant numloer of these research
personnel would mean the virtual death

like —duty not to destroy a portion of
the University's trust assets at the

request of some number or even a
majority of the present beneficiaries of
that trust, rejecting forever the claims
(and quite possibly, the differing value
judgments) of those yet to come."
Selling SRI
Scott concluded that "the choice
then comes down to selling SRI for its
full value and using the proceeds to
further education, and the kinds of
research needed by our society, at the
University, or diverting part of the
University's existing resources to pay
for research at SRI."
"It does not seem to me that this
choice is in principle a difficult one to
make. Certainly it is not a difficult one
to assess from the standpoint of the
University, and that is the standpoint
which this community should realize
the Trustees are legally required by
virtue of their office to adopt."
WolfgjJng Panofsky, director of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator Center, had
a different approach to the problem.
''I consider the University
community at large to be poorly
informed about the actual workings of
SRI and thus many of the discussions
on the reorientation of the goals of SRI
have little substance," he said.
"I do believe, however ... it would
be worthwhile to take a hard look at the
possibility of rededicating SRI towards
non-military goals as an important pilot
experiment."
Panofsky added he felt that "our
current national priorities are
distorted—we are overcommitted to
military pursuits and undercommitted
to the solution of our internal
environmental and urban problems,"
and then made a series of
recommendations.
He asked that "the possibility be

explored to dedicate SRI to the solution
of the broad needs of our society caused
by the burgeoning population on this
globe," and that no move be made to
separate SRI until such a study is
completed.
He suggested such a study be
undertaken during the summer, and
include "heavy representation of SRI
personnel of various administrative
levels in addition to Stanford students,
faculty, administrators, and trustees."
The study, he urged, "should either
lead to a clearly feasible plan for
constructive dedication of SRI to
civilian goals, or lead to steps to
separate SRI from the University."
Earlier, Anderson sharply attacked
the "arrogant suggestion that a small
group that does not represent a majority
viewpoint should rule on the moral
acceptability of research."
He said he was "indignant, then
incredulous" that the SRI committee's
suggestion for creating a research review
committee was being taken seriously.
"My concern has since deepened," he
added.
"The majority does not condone
thought control," he noted. "What
disturbs me is that a tiny fraction of our
society, through demonstrations, sit-ins
and harangues of half-truths and
misrepresentations can so flout the
rights of others and so disrupt the
orderly workings of our community.
Objective research cannot be carried out
under outside and restrictive controls,
moral or financial, from whatever
source."
