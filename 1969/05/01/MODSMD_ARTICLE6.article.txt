# Chaos Next?

Stanford University lias never stood
closer to ciiaos than it does today.
There has never been more fear, more
hate, or more despair than this morning.
Encina Hall is occupied. It was not
occupied in peace last night. It stands as a
monument to misguided student revolt,
revolt sure to achieve nothing it seeks,
unless it seeks destruction.
Until yesterday, the April 3rd
Movement represented a coherent, rational,
and desirable drive for essential reform at
Stanford and SRI. The AEL sit-in was
peaceful and controlled. It gave a focus to
consideration of research policies rarely
questioned before and helped produce
significant change in research practices at
the University.
The AEL occupation did not achieve all
its goals. It may be best remembered for
illuminating issues and beginning the push
to end objectionable war related research in
the Stanford community.
It may have been inevitable that the
April 3rd Movement would become
intensely frustrated from exposure to dead

weight Trustees. Yesterday was another
trip in estrangement to Trustee
mindlessness. The trip, however, did not
need to end in Encina Hall, unless the
motivation was self denial and suicide.
Occupation of Encina will not cause the
Trustees to bring SRI closer to Stanford. It
will have the opposite effect. Trustees will
become further intransigent, if that is
possible. They certainly will not respond to
the "power base" at Encina with anything
but disgust. It is tragic that the Stanford
faculty, students, and staff will now
probably join the Trustees in resentment.
Everything about the Movement
yesterday was wrong. Their meetings,
particularly as the day progressed, were
exercises in anger, dispute, and totally
intolerable procedure. The problem was
stated by a speaker at last night's meeting
in Tresidder. He said, "This is a meeting of
the April 3rd Movement, not of the
Stanford community."
It is bitter irony that the Movement
should become as inflexible and detestible
as the Trustees they so strongly challenge
and vilify.
