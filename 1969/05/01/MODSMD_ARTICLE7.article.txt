(The following statement,
written by two members of THE
DAILY editorial committee,
dissent from today's editorial.)
Frustration and despair led
part of this community to Encina
Hall last night.
Many of those who share the
commitment of the April 3rd
Movement have not joined the
action. But their frustration and

their despair is equal to that of
Encina's new occupants.
Stanford's agony is not
accidental. It is the product of the
Trustees who consistently refused
to utter a moral word concerning
the death-dealing activities of this
country in the Third World. It was
fed by the weakness of a faculty
that could neither act nor allow
their debate to be made public.
The only alternative to an

action last night was inaction.
Inaction is the policy of Trustees
and the vice of teachers. Those
who live with awareness of
Vietnam and Thailand and
Guatemala had to challenge those
who now hold power.
The struggle is real. We must be
strong in our commitment to it.
