# 'Academic Freedom'
## Coin Of Academic Realm 
### Bill Cozad 
For as long as I can remember
and, probably, for as long as there
have been such creatures, teachers
have criticized student opinion for
being simple-minded and narrow
in scope. Finding myself in
substantial danger of graduating, I
would like to return some this
before it is too late.
The subject of my criticism is
the position many faculty
members have taken on the
question of academic freedom—a
matter about which these teachers
have either been very simplistic or
very inarticulate. I would like to
discuss three points which these
teachers commonly assert or
assume.
First, they speak as if academic
freedom were an absolute. It isn't.
No member of the academic
community is free to do
experimental research on
''Living-Human -Flesh-
Penetration-Effects of Assorted
Types of Military and Sporting
Ammunition." Also, I would
assume that almost all members of
such a community would find
unacceptable research in which
the results are intentionally
distorted to serve the interests of
the sponsor. As a further example,
many members of the academic
community condemn C.B.W. and
counterinsurgency research. The
question, and it is a difficult one,
is where the line between
acceptable and unacceptable
research is to be drawn.
'Simplistic' Notion
A second point which is
commonly made is that even
though it is granted that there are
various types of research which
are unacceptable, the decision on
this matter must be left to the
conscience of the individual
researcher. Again, this is overly
simplistic. It also indicates an
incredibly naive view about the
effects much research has on the
people and the world around us.
Any researcher who takes serious
steps towards accepting the
hypothetical ballistics
contract —that's a neutral term to
indicate possible civilian uses—will
probably have his options sharply
restricted by an outside agency.
If a contract proposal
suggesting the distortion of results
is made by or to researcher Smith,
Smith's colleagues will have a talk
with Smith. A major external
limitation, which many faculty
members are prone to overlook,
involves the relation of the
university to the rest of society

and the market demand for
various types of research.
For reasons which are
becoming increasingly obvious,
the public and private funds
available for research on the
development of improved
weapons systems far exceeds that
available for research on the
development of improved social
and ecological systems. The issue,
then, is not whether there may be
any limits beyond the conscience
of the individual researcher, but
whether the existing limits and
their implicit priorities are
satisfactory.
Which Freedom?
The third point has to do with
the extent to which the concept
of academic freedom applies to
SRI. Mr. Anderson seems to be
telling us that he and most of the
employees of SRI are of the view
that Stanford has no right to limit
the types of research done at SRI.
Many teachers seem to share this
view. It is unclear whether the
concept involved is academic
freedom or freedom of contract.
It sounds rather peculiar for
the president of SRI to be
invoking academic freedom.
Assuming that this does make
sense, however, this assertion is
analogous to saying that if there
are students and faculty interested
in such a project the Stanford
Trustees have no right to reject an
offer by the Chinese to establish a
School of Revolutionary Thought
and Action at Stanford. If the
concept in question is freedom of
contract, the assertion is
analogous to the statement that a
parent corporation has no right to
determine the product line of its
wholly owned subsidiary.
In short, and as the majority
report points out, the Board of
Trustees does have the right to
control the work done at SRI.
Perhaps the point is that such
control should not be exercized.
If so, then supporting arguments
are in order. Mr. Anderson's
threat that he and a majority of
the SRI employees will quit if
controls are imposed is coercive
and, therefore, cannot be dealt
with in the context of a rational
discussion of academic freedom.
The question immediately
arises why so many presumably
intelligent people are so quick to
put forward arguments based on a
complex and extensive concept in
such a simplistic and limited form.
One possibility is that they feel
this is all students can grasp. A
second, and more likely,
possibility is that academic
freedom is the most emotive
concept easily available for the
defense of the status quo; when
personal interests are drawn into
question the substance of

reasoned discussion tends to
dissolve.
An aside to Harvey Hukari:
Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary defines "conservative"
as "disposed to maintain existing
institutions or views." I think
your criticism of Stanford for its
lack of conservative faculty
members is rather unfounded.

the president of SRI to be
invoking academic freedom.
Assuming that this does make
sense, however, this assertion is
analogous to saying that if there
are students and faculty interested
in such a project the Stanford
Trustees have no right to reject an
offer by the Chinese to establish a
School of Revolutionary Thought
and Action at Stanford. If the
concept in question is freedom of
contract, the assertion is
analogous to the statement that a
parent corporation has no right to
determine the product line of its
wholly owned subsidiary.
In short, and as the majority
report points out, the Board of
Trustees does have the right to
control the work done at SRI.
Perhaps the point is that such
control should not be exercized.
If so, then supporting arguments
are in order. Mr. Anderson's
threat that he and a majority of
the SRI employees will quit if
controls are imposed is coercive
and, therefore, cannot be dealt
with in the context of a rational
discussion of academic freedom.
The question immediately
arises why so many presumably
intelligent people are so quick to
put forward arguments based on a
complex and extensive concept in
such a simplistic and limited form.
One possibility is that they feel
this is all students can grasp. A
second, and more likely,
possibility is that academic
freedom is the most emotive
concept easily available for the
defense of the status quo; when
personal interests are drawn into
question the substance of

reasoned discussion tends to
dissolve.
An aside to Harvey Hukari:
Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary defines "conservative"
as "disposed to maintain existing
institutions or views." I think
your criticism of Stanford for its
lack of conservative faculty
members is rather unfounded.
(Bill Cozad is a third-year law
studcn t—Fd.)
For as long as I can remember
and, probably, for as long as there
have been such creatures, teachers
have criticized student opinion for
being simple-minded and narrow
in scope. Finding myself in
substantial danger of graduating, I
would like to return some this
before it is too late.
The subject of my criticism is
the position many faculty
members have taken on the
question of academic freedom—a
matter about which these teachers
have either been very simplistic or
very inarticulate. I would like to
discuss three points which these
teachers commonly assert or
assume.
First, they speak as if academic
freedom were an absolute. It isn't.
No member of the academic
community is free to do
experimental research on
''Living-Human -Flesh-
Penetration-Effects of Assorted
Types of Military and Sporting
Ammunition." Also, I would
assume that almost all members of
such a community would find
unacceptable research in which
the results are intentionally
distorted to serve the interests of
the sponsor. As a further example,
many members of the academic
community condemn C.B.W. and
counterinsurgency research. The
question, and it is a difficult one,
is where the line between
acceptable and unacceptable
research is to be drawn.
'Simplistic' Notion
A second point which is
commonly made is that even
though it is granted that there are
various types of research which
are unacceptable, the decision on
this matter must be left to the
conscience of the individual
researcher. Again, this is overly
simplistic. It also indicates an
incredibly naive view about the
effects much research has on the
people and the world around us.
Any researcher who takes serious
steps towards accepting the
hypothetical ballistics
contract —that's a neutral term to
indicate possible civilian uses—will
probably have his options sharply
restricted by an outside agency.
If a contract proposal
suggesting the distortion of results
is made by or to researcher Smith,
Smith's colleagues will have a talk
with Smith. A major external
limitation, which many faculty
members are prone to overlook,
involves the relation of the
university to the rest of society

and the market demand for
various types of research.
For reasons which are
becoming increasingly obvious,
the public and private funds
available for research on the
development of improved
weapons systems far exceeds that
available for research on the
development of improved social
and ecological systems. The issue,
then, is not whether there may be
any limits beyond the conscience
of the individual researcher, but
whether the existing limits and
their implicit priorities are
satisfactory.
Which Freedom?
The third point has to do with
the extent to which the concept
of academic freedom applies to
SRI. Mr. Anderson seems to be
telling us that he and most of the
employees of SRI are of the view
that Stanford has no right to limit
the types of research done at SRI.
Many teachers seem to share this
view. It is unclear whether the
concept involved is academic
freedom or freedom of contract.

A second point which is
commonly made is that even
though it is granted that there are
various types of research which
are unacceptable, the decision on
this matter must be left to the
conscience of the individual
researcher. Again, this is overly
simplistic. It also indicates an
incredibly naive view about the
effects much research has on the
people and the world around us.
Any researcher who takes serious
steps towards accepting the
hypothetical ballistics
contract —that's a neutral term to
indicate possible civilian uses—will
probably have his options sharply
restricted by an outside agency.
If a contract proposal
suggesting the distortion of results
is made by or to researcher Smith,
Smith's colleagues will have a talk
with Smith. A major external
limitation, which many faculty
members are prone to overlook,
involves the relation of the
university to the rest of society

and the market demand for
various types of research.
For reasons which are
becoming increasingly obvious,
the public and private funds
available for research on the
development of improved
weapons systems far exceeds that
available for research on the
development of improved social
and ecological systems. The issue,
then, is not whether there may be
any limits beyond the conscience
of the individual researcher, but
whether the existing limits and
their implicit priorities are
satisfactory.
Which Freedom?
The third point has to do with
the extent to which the concept
of academic freedom applies to
SRI. Mr. Anderson seems to be
telling us that he and most of the
employees of SRI are of the view
that Stanford has no right to limit
the types of research done at SRI.
Many teachers seem to share this
view. It is unclear whether the
concept involved is academic
freedom or freedom of contract.
It sounds rather peculiar for
the president of SRI to be
invoking academic freedom.
Assuming that this does make
sense, however, this assertion is
analogous to saying that if there
are students and faculty interested
in such a project the Stanford
Trustees have no right to reject an
offer by the Chinese to establish a
School of Revolutionary Thought
and Action at Stanford. If the
concept in question is freedom of
contract, the assertion is
analogous to the statement that a
parent corporation has no right to
determine the product line of its
wholly owned subsidiary.
In short, and as the majority
report points out, the Board of
Trustees does have the right to
control the work done at SRI.
Perhaps the point is that such
control should not be exercized.
If so, then supporting arguments
are in order. Mr. Anderson's
threat that he and a majority of
the SRI employees will quit if
controls are imposed is coercive
and, therefore, cannot be dealt
with in the context of a rational
discussion of academic freedom.
The question immediately
arises why so many presumably
intelligent people are so quick to
put forward arguments based on a
complex and extensive concept in
such a simplistic and limited form.
One possibility is that they feel
this is all students can grasp. A
second, and more likely,
possibility is that academic
freedom is the most emotive
concept easily available for the
defense of the status quo; when
personal interests are drawn into
question the substance of

reasoned discussion tends to
dissolve.
An aside to Harvey Hukari:
Webster's New Collegiate
Dictionary defines "conservative"
as "disposed to maintain existing
institutions or views." I think
your criticism of Stanford for its
lack of conservative faculty
members is rather unfounded.
