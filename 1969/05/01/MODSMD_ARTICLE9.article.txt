## Editorial Provokes Questions 
### Tom Sanford 
The editorial entitled "Trustee
Failure," and the sweeping
indictments it levels against the
people who not only have the
authority but also the
responsibility to shape the course
of this university raises for me a
number of interesting questions.
One of the accusations against
Trustee John W. Gardner is that
he has the temerity to label the
demand for an open meeting of
the Trustees on the SRI question
as the silliest suggestion he had
heard in years.
It seems fairly obvious that the
editorial writer sees nothing at all
silly about such a suggestion.
Along with Mr. Gardner, I do.
When, I would ask, will the
Trustees be allowed to accomplish
the serious business of their
Trusteeship in its manifold
manifestations if, every time some
segment of the university
community disagrees with the
actions of another segment, the
Trustees must stage an open
meeting on this intramural beef
and let every Joe College or Paul
Professor or Steve Staffer who so
desires step up and speak his
piece?
No such precedent would be
established, cry the April 3rd
Movers.
I'm not so sure about that. It
seems to me that quite a lot of
precedents are being established in
this time at this place—one of the
most significant and potentially
most dangerous being that of
conducting specific facets of the
university's business by the device
of an endless series of popular
referenda.
Does any great cry arise from
this campus for open meetings of
the Trustees when they are
grappling with the very real and
very serious problems of providing
for the continued financial health
of Stanford University. I am
unaware of any demand from
April 3rders (or anybody else on
the campus) to be allowed to help
the Trustees with such
money-grubbing activities as
shaping the university budget and
devising the means to implement
it.
That's just trivial detail, say the
dissidents. What we want to help
the Trustees decide is their
posture regarding the eternal
verities (as we determine those
verities to be). Simply let us tell
you what SRI can and cannot do.
Then we'll again withdraw into
our campus cocoon and let you
wrestle with such mundane
matters as fitting our edict to the
realities of maintaining the
university as a dymanic and
practical entity in a world which
is (or should be) bound by the
profound ethical and moral
concepts which concern us.
Trustee Gardner and his
colleagues are indicted also
because they do not merit by
their actions the confidence and
trust of a "large segment of
Stanford's population.
What, I would ask, are the
actions of that segment of

Stanford's population which
inspire the Trustees to view that
group with confidence and trust?
Would it be the forced entrance
into a recent Trustee meeting—the
"crashing" of that meeting, if you
will —by uninvited students?
Would it be the emphatically
expressed aggressiveness and
rudeness of students toward
individual Trustees, including
John Gardner in the most recent
instance? Or perhaps it is the
coercion applied by the sit-in
tactics at AEL which ought to
reassure the Trustees that they
would be treated with courtesy if
they would only hold an open
meeting with the campus
community at large?
One of the delineating
characteristics of the
politically-motivated student is
the adeptness and facility with
which he asks questions. And the
impatience of his reaction to what
he considers a failure to respond
to his question. (A failure which
occurs, by the way, any time he
disagrees with the response.)
I would suggest that
somewhere along the line of his
growth into maturity, the student
is going to discover it is much
easier to ask questions than it is to
answer them.
The Daily's editorial writer
can't understand why Gardner
was unable to answer the simple
question of whether he valued
more highly other people's right
to their lives or a researcher's right
to do research leading to death.
I submit that that is only
another form of the old question:
"Have you stopped beating your
wife?"
Trustee Gardner was damned
either way he answered that
question.
No, not damned in the eyes of
his immediate questioners, or in
the eyes of the Daily's editor, or
in the eyes of that particular
segment of the Stanford
population which takes one
particular view of this
controversy. Not if he answered
questions the "right" way
according to their view.
But what happens to Gardner's
reputation for intellectual
honesty, his "progressive liberal"
posture in the larger world (there
is one, you know, out there,
beyond the confines of Stanford
U.) if he supplies the "right"
answer to that question and
thereby commits himself to the
principle of research censorship?
Not so, again I hear the April
3rd comrades (their term, not
mine) cry. We don't want to
censor ALL research. Just that
research which is immoral. That
which is destructive. That which
contributes nothing to the greater
good of mankind. AS
DETERMINED BY US, OF
COURSE.
We only want, say the militant
radicals, to impregnate the
University research question with
a little bit of censorship. How can
you ascribe the possibility of such

a dastardly and immoral
development as thought control
to a group of us who approach
with such pure hearts and clean
hands?
I do not know if any great
good will come to mankind from
the present, feeble exploration of
space. It seems to me entirely
possible that yet undiscovered
boons await somewhere out there
among the stars. And maybe not.
What does seem fairly certain is
that man's present impetus
toward discovery in that void, the
very vehicle by which he now
timidly strides into space is a
product of "war-related research."
Certainly, if this were an ideal
world we live in, and proper

priorities were attached to all our
endeavors, some things would
come first. Likely the
improvement of man's lot on
earth ought to be put ahead of a
trip to the moon.
But, how do we really know?
Perhaps that war-related, chemical
warfare research which produced
the rocket which led man into
space will, in turn, lead him to
knowledge of incalculable benefit
to humanity.
That kind of question is not so
easy for me to answer as it would
seem to be for many individuals
on this campus.
