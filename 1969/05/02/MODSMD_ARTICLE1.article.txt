# Encina Sit-In Ended As Police Summoned; Court Order Brought Against Protestors
## Faculty Votes 403-356 To End All Credit For ROTC 
### DAVE BROWN THOMAS C. DAWSON 
In a mail ballot, the Stanford faculty
has voted 403-356 to end academic
credit for military training and
education, starting with the 1970
freshman class, Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler reported yesterday.
Their action is in accord with a 25-8
vote of the Senate of the Academic
Council Feb. 23.
The vote will not affect the 360
students now enrolled in ROTC
programs at Stanford. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer indicated he will
consult with the Department of
Defense, looking toward the
establishment of an appropriate
non-credit program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of Army
ROTC at Stanford, claimed that "the
purpose of the mail referendum was
that of asking that President Pitzer be
allowed to negotiate with the Defense
Department without restrictions being
placed on anyone." He added that "the
results of the referendum will make
negotiations very difficult."
Individual Mail Ballots
Nearly 1,000 professors received
individual mail ballots for the vote, in
the first such test of a major Senate
action. The appeal to the entire Faculty
resulted from a petition signed by 70
Faculty members.
On Feb. 24, a 3-2 majority of
students voting in a campus referendum
said "ROTC has a legitimate place on
campus and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic interest."
The Senate vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces office program "for
the purposes of administration,
counseling, and recruiting for reserve
officer training and education." It also
called for individual contracts between
Stanford students and the armed forces
to be revised to reflect actual practice,
which permits students to drop ROTC
scholarships without penalty during
their first two years.
After Next September
After September, 1970, each class of
entering freshmen will no longer be able
to take ROTC for credit. After
September, 1973, when four successive
freshman classes will have entered
Stanford, no student will be granted
credit for ROTC courses taken and
ROTC will have the status of an
extracurricular activity. During this four
year transition period, ROTC
instructors will have the official title,
"Lecturer with Rank of Professor."
After September, 1973, they will lose
faculty status.
The faculty action against ROTC
credit had its root in a September, 1967
recommendation to the Academic
Senate by English Assistant Professor
Anne Kostelanetz and nine other
faculty members.
The group asked that Academic
Credit be abolished for ROTC courses
and that military training and education
be restricted to off-campus. The Senate
instituted a nine-member Ad-Hoc
Committee on ROTC, for the purpose
of more closely studying its relationship
to the University.
Committee Members
The committee included George
Cattermole. Prof. Tom Connolly, Mark
Edwards, Tom Grissom, Prof.
Kostelanetz, Joseph Carrato, Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, and Col.
Robert Thomas.
Last February 12, the committee
released a majority report of six
members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

In an unprecedented and unexpected
move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.
Move On Encina
Only moments before the first squad
of police moved into Encina, the hectic
meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was
