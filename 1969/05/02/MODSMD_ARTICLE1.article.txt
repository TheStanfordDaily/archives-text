# Encina Sit-In Ended As Police Summoned; Court Order Brought Against Protestors
## Faculty Votes 403-356 To End All Credit For ROTC 
### DAVE BROWN THOMAS C. DAWSON 
In a mail ballot, the Stanford faculty
has voted 403-356 to end academic
credit for military training and
education, starting with the 1970
freshman class, Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler reported yesterday.
Their action is in accord with a 25-8
vote of the Senate of the Academic
Council Feb. 23.
The vote will not affect the 360
students now enrolled in ROTC
programs at Stanford. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer indicated he will
consult with the Department of
Defense, looking toward the
establishment of an appropriate
non-credit program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of Army
ROTC at Stanford, claimed that "the
purpose of the mail referendum was
that of asking that President Pitzer be
allowed to negotiate with the Defense
Department without restrictions being
placed on anyone." He added that "the
results of the referendum will make
negotiations very difficult."
Individual Mail Ballots
Nearly 1,000 professors received
individual mail ballots for the vote, in
the first such test of a major Senate
action. The appeal to the entire Faculty
resulted from a petition signed by 70
Faculty members.
On Feb. 24, a 3-2 majority of
students voting in a campus referendum
said "ROTC has a legitimate place on
campus and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic interest."
The Senate vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces office program "for
the purposes of administration,
counseling, and recruiting for reserve
officer training and education." It also
called for individual contracts between
Stanford students and the armed forces
to be revised to reflect actual practice,
which permits students to drop ROTC
scholarships without penalty during
their first two years.
After Next September
After September, 1970, each class of
entering freshmen will no longer be able
to take ROTC for credit. After
September, 1973, when four successive
freshman classes will have entered
Stanford, no student will be granted
credit for ROTC courses taken and
ROTC will have the status of an
extracurricular activity. During this four
year transition period, ROTC
instructors will have the official title,
"Lecturer with Rank of Professor."
After September, 1973, they will lose
faculty status.
The faculty action against ROTC
credit had its root in a September, 1967
recommendation to the Academic
Senate by English Assistant Professor
Anne Kostelanetz and nine other
faculty members.
The group asked that Academic
Credit be abolished for ROTC courses
and that military training and education
be restricted to off-campus. The Senate
instituted a nine-member Ad-Hoc
Committee on ROTC, for the purpose
of more closely studying its relationship
to the University.
Committee Members
The committee included George
Cattermole. Prof. Tom Connolly, Mark
Edwards, Tom Grissom, Prof.
Kostelanetz, Joseph Carrato, Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, and Col.
Robert Thomas.
Last February 12, the committee
released a majority report of six
members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

In an unprecedented and unexpected
move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.
Move On Encina
Only moments before the first squad
of police moved into Encina, the hectic
meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was

immediately informed of the vote to
leave and he yelled at the police to stop.
Other faculty members joined in the
call, and police officials intervened,
ordering their officers to stop.
For a tense 10 minutes, the
demonstrators gathered their belongings
as the police grew increasingly
impatient. Finally, the police informed
University officials that they would
have to implement their order to arrest
students. Moments later the
demonstrators left.
Demonstrators Leave
The last demonstrators left Encina at
about 7:25 a.m. leaving some 70 police
inside the building. The police canvassed
the sandstone structure but made no
arrests.
The demonstrators formed on the
west Encina Hall lawn where they
spotted President Pitzer and Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff. About
half the demonstrators, joined with
many other bystanders, then
surrounded Pitzer and Schiff asking
them why police had been summoned
onto the campus.
Pitzer responded that the University
had attempted to deal with the sit-in
through the established internal judicial
procedures, but that the demonstrators
had not respected them leaving the
University with no recourse but to call
on outside police to clear the building.
"We've been just as patient as we
could be. We've tried to use internal
judicial procedures; you've not
recognized these ... It was the only
thing left to do," Pitzer said to the
crowd.
The response of the demonstrators
was quite vocal with taunts such as
"President Pig-sir," "Professor
Bullshift," and "fuck you" being
directed towrad Schiff and Pitzer.
In the meantime, some of the police
occupying Encina Hall had exited the
building though about forty still
remained inside. The demonstrators
then left Pitzer and Schiff and

proceeded to the steps of Encina Hall
where they held an impromptu meeting
for about forty minutes alter which
time about 80 demonstrators went to
President Pitzer's office in Building 10
on the Quad.
About 40 demonstrators packed into
the reception area of the President's
Office. They attempted to enter
the office area but were prevented by a
steel gate and doors guarded by plain
clothes Santa Clara police. The students
entered Building 10 after pushing past
Bill Wyman who tried to keep the door
closed. Occupation of the reception area
lasted seven minutes.
The group then returned to the steps
of Encina Hall to continue their
meeting. In the meantime the San Jose
police had departed, going to the
Stanford police station where they
rested up and drank coffee. About half
the Santa Clara officers remained in the
building and half in a waiting bus.
A little later, University assistant
business manager deYoung announced
to the crowd outside the building that
Encina Hall had been declared a
restricted area open only to those
having legitimate business there. He
stated that legitimate business, in cases
of doubt, would be determined by the
administration.
Immediately thereafter the police
left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.
Talk among the demonstraotrs
included the possibility of reoccupying
Encina Hall as soon as the police left,
but sentiment was against this, in part
because of the small number of people
present. Considerable attention was
focused on reasons for the small turnout
of sit-inners with the lack of community
in recent April 3rd Movement meetings.

meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was

immediately informed of the vote to
leave and he yelled at the police to stop.
Other faculty members joined in the
call, and police officials intervened,
ordering their officers to stop.
For a tense 10 minutes, the
demonstrators gathered their belongings
as the police grew increasingly
impatient. Finally, the police informed
University officials that they would
have to implement their order to arrest
students. Moments later the
demonstrators left.
Demonstrators Leave
The last demonstrators left Encina at
about 7:25 a.m. leaving some 70 police
inside the building. The police canvassed
the sandstone structure but made no
arrests.
The demonstrators formed on the
west Encina Hall lawn where they
spotted President Pitzer and Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff. About
half the demonstrators, joined with
many other bystanders, then
surrounded Pitzer and Schiff asking
them why police had been summoned
onto the campus.
Pitzer responded that the University
had attempted to deal with the sit-in
through the established internal judicial
procedures, but that the demonstrators
had not respected them leaving the
University with no recourse but to call
on outside police to clear the building.
"We've been just as patient as we
could be. We've tried to use internal
judicial procedures; you've not
recognized these ... It was the only
thing left to do," Pitzer said to the
crowd.
The response of the demonstrators
was quite vocal with taunts such as
"President Pig-sir," "Professor
Bullshift," and "fuck you" being
directed towrad Schiff and Pitzer.
In the meantime, some of the police
occupying Encina Hall had exited the
building though about forty still
remained inside. The demonstrators
then left Pitzer and Schiff and

proceeded to the steps of Encina Hall
where they held an impromptu meeting
for about forty minutes alter which
time about 80 demonstrators went to
President Pitzer's office in Building 10
on the Quad.
About 40 demonstrators packed into
the reception area of the President's
Office. They attempted to enter
the office area but were prevented by a
steel gate and doors guarded by plain
clothes Santa Clara police. The students
entered Building 10 after pushing past
Bill Wyman who tried to keep the door
closed. Occupation of the reception area
lasted seven minutes.
The group then returned to the steps
of Encina Hall to continue their
meeting. In the meantime the San Jose
police had departed, going to the
Stanford police station where they
rested up and drank coffee. About half
the Santa Clara officers remained in the
building and half in a waiting bus.
A little later, University assistant
business manager deYoung announced
to the crowd outside the building that
Encina Hall had been declared a
restricted area open only to those
having legitimate business there. He
stated that legitimate business, in cases
of doubt, would be determined by the
administration.
Immediately thereafter the police
left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.
Talk among the demonstraotrs
included the possibility of reoccupying
Encina Hall as soon as the police left,
but sentiment was against this, in part
because of the small number of people
present. Considerable attention was
focused on reasons for the small turnout
of sit-inners with the lack of community
in recent April 3rd Movement meetings.
In a mail ballot, the Stanford faculty
has voted 403-356 to end academic
credit for military training and
education, starting with the 1970
freshman class, Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler reported yesterday.
Their action is in accord with a 25-8
vote of the Senate of the Academic
Council Feb. 23.
The vote will not affect the 360
students now enrolled in ROTC
programs at Stanford. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer indicated he will
consult with the Department of
Defense, looking toward the
establishment of an appropriate
non-credit program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of Army
ROTC at Stanford, claimed that "the
purpose of the mail referendum was
that of asking that President Pitzer be
allowed to negotiate with the Defense
Department without restrictions being
placed on anyone." He added that "the
results of the referendum will make
negotiations very difficult."
Individual Mail Ballots
Nearly 1,000 professors received
individual mail ballots for the vote, in
the first such test of a major Senate
action. The appeal to the entire Faculty
resulted from a petition signed by 70
Faculty members.
On Feb. 24, a 3-2 majority of
students voting in a campus referendum
said "ROTC has a legitimate place on
campus and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic interest."
The Senate vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces office program "for
the purposes of administration,
counseling, and recruiting for reserve
officer training and education." It also
called for individual contracts between
Stanford students and the armed forces
to be revised to reflect actual practice,
which permits students to drop ROTC
scholarships without penalty during
their first two years.
After Next September
After September, 1970, each class of
entering freshmen will no longer be able
to take ROTC for credit. After
September, 1973, when four successive
freshman classes will have entered
Stanford, no student will be granted
credit for ROTC courses taken and
ROTC will have the status of an
extracurricular activity. During this four
year transition period, ROTC
instructors will have the official title,
"Lecturer with Rank of Professor."
After September, 1973, they will lose
faculty status.
The faculty action against ROTC
credit had its root in a September, 1967
recommendation to the Academic
Senate by English Assistant Professor
Anne Kostelanetz and nine other
faculty members.
The group asked that Academic
Credit be abolished for ROTC courses
and that military training and education
be restricted to off-campus. The Senate
instituted a nine-member Ad-Hoc
Committee on ROTC, for the purpose
of more closely studying its relationship
to the University.
Committee Members
The committee included George
Cattermole. Prof. Tom Connolly, Mark
Edwards, Tom Grissom, Prof.
Kostelanetz, Joseph Carrato, Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, and Col.
Robert Thomas.
Last February 12, the committee
released a majority report of six
members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

In an unprecedented and unexpected
move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.

move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.
Move On Encina
Only moments before the first squad
of police moved into Encina, the hectic
meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was

immediately informed of the vote to
leave and he yelled at the police to stop.
Other faculty members joined in the
call, and police officials intervened,
ordering their officers to stop.
For a tense 10 minutes, the
demonstrators gathered their belongings
as the police grew increasingly
impatient. Finally, the police informed
University officials that they would
have to implement their order to arrest
students. Moments later the
demonstrators left.
Demonstrators Leave
The last demonstrators left Encina at
about 7:25 a.m. leaving some 70 police
inside the building. The police canvassed
the sandstone structure but made no
arrests.
The demonstrators formed on the
west Encina Hall lawn where they
spotted President Pitzer and Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff. About
half the demonstrators, joined with
many other bystanders, then
surrounded Pitzer and Schiff asking
them why police had been summoned
onto the campus.
Pitzer responded that the University
had attempted to deal with the sit-in
through the established internal judicial
procedures, but that the demonstrators
had not respected them leaving the
University with no recourse but to call
on outside police to clear the building.
"We've been just as patient as we
could be. We've tried to use internal
judicial procedures; you've not
recognized these ... It was the only
thing left to do," Pitzer said to the
crowd.
The response of the demonstrators
was quite vocal with taunts such as
"President Pig-sir," "Professor
Bullshift," and "fuck you" being
directed towrad Schiff and Pitzer.
In the meantime, some of the police
occupying Encina Hall had exited the
building though about forty still
remained inside. The demonstrators
then left Pitzer and Schiff and

proceeded to the steps of Encina Hall
where they held an impromptu meeting
for about forty minutes alter which
time about 80 demonstrators went to
President Pitzer's office in Building 10
on the Quad.
About 40 demonstrators packed into
the reception area of the President's
Office. They attempted to enter
the office area but were prevented by a
steel gate and doors guarded by plain
clothes Santa Clara police. The students
entered Building 10 after pushing past
Bill Wyman who tried to keep the door
closed. Occupation of the reception area
lasted seven minutes.
The group then returned to the steps
of Encina Hall to continue their
meeting. In the meantime the San Jose
police had departed, going to the
Stanford police station where they
rested up and drank coffee. About half
the Santa Clara officers remained in the
building and half in a waiting bus.
A little later, University assistant
business manager deYoung announced
to the crowd outside the building that
Encina Hall had been declared a
restricted area open only to those
having legitimate business there. He
stated that legitimate business, in cases
of doubt, would be determined by the
administration.
Immediately thereafter the police
left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.
Talk among the demonstraotrs
included the possibility of reoccupying
Encina Hall as soon as the police left,
but sentiment was against this, in part
because of the small number of people
present. Considerable attention was
focused on reasons for the small turnout
of sit-inners with the lack of community
in recent April 3rd Movement meetings.
In a mail ballot, the Stanford faculty
has voted 403-356 to end academic
credit for military training and
education, starting with the 1970
freshman class, Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler reported yesterday.
Their action is in accord with a 25-8
vote of the Senate of the Academic
Council Feb. 23.
The vote will not affect the 360
students now enrolled in ROTC
programs at Stanford. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer indicated he will
consult with the Department of
Defense, looking toward the
establishment of an appropriate
non-credit program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of Army
ROTC at Stanford, claimed that "the
purpose of the mail referendum was
that of asking that President Pitzer be
allowed to negotiate with the Defense
Department without restrictions being
placed on anyone." He added that "the
results of the referendum will make
negotiations very difficult."
Individual Mail Ballots
Nearly 1,000 professors received
individual mail ballots for the vote, in
the first such test of a major Senate
action. The appeal to the entire Faculty
resulted from a petition signed by 70
Faculty members.
On Feb. 24, a 3-2 majority of
students voting in a campus referendum
said "ROTC has a legitimate place on
campus and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic interest."
The Senate vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces office program "for
the purposes of administration,
counseling, and recruiting for reserve
officer training and education." It also
called for individual contracts between
Stanford students and the armed forces
to be revised to reflect actual practice,
which permits students to drop ROTC
scholarships without penalty during
their first two years.
After Next September
After September, 1970, each class of
entering freshmen will no longer be able
to take ROTC for credit. After
September, 1973, when four successive
freshman classes will have entered
Stanford, no student will be granted
credit for ROTC courses taken and
ROTC will have the status of an
extracurricular activity. During this four
year transition period, ROTC
instructors will have the official title,
"Lecturer with Rank of Professor."
After September, 1973, they will lose
faculty status.
The faculty action against ROTC
credit had its root in a September, 1967
recommendation to the Academic
Senate by English Assistant Professor
Anne Kostelanetz and nine other
faculty members.
The group asked that Academic
Credit be abolished for ROTC courses
and that military training and education
be restricted to off-campus. The Senate
instituted a nine-member Ad-Hoc
Committee on ROTC, for the purpose
of more closely studying its relationship
to the University.
Committee Members
The committee included George
Cattermole. Prof. Tom Connolly, Mark
Edwards, Tom Grissom, Prof.
Kostelanetz, Joseph Carrato, Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, and Col.
Robert Thomas.
Last February 12, the committee
released a majority report of six
members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.
Talk among the demonstraotrs
included the possibility of reoccupying
Encina Hall as soon as the police left,
but sentiment was against this, in part
because of the small number of people
present. Considerable attention was
focused on reasons for the small turnout
of sit-inners with the lack of community
in recent April 3rd Movement meetings.
In a mail ballot, the Stanford faculty
has voted 403-356 to end academic
credit for military training and
education, starting with the 1970
freshman class, Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler reported yesterday.
Their action is in accord with a 25-8
vote of the Senate of the Academic
Council Feb. 23.
The vote will not affect the 360
students now enrolled in ROTC
programs at Stanford. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer indicated he will
consult with the Department of
Defense, looking toward the
establishment of an appropriate
non-credit program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of Army
ROTC at Stanford, claimed that "the
purpose of the mail referendum was
that of asking that President Pitzer be
allowed to negotiate with the Defense
Department without restrictions being
placed on anyone." He added that "the
results of the referendum will make
negotiations very difficult."
Individual Mail Ballots
Nearly 1,000 professors received
individual mail ballots for the vote, in
the first such test of a major Senate
action. The appeal to the entire Faculty
resulted from a petition signed by 70
Faculty members.
On Feb. 24, a 3-2 majority of
students voting in a campus referendum
said "ROTC has a legitimate place on
campus and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic interest."
The Senate vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces office program "for
the purposes of administration,
counseling, and recruiting for reserve
officer training and education." It also
called for individual contracts between
Stanford students and the armed forces
to be revised to reflect actual practice,
which permits students to drop ROTC
scholarships without penalty during
their first two years.
After Next September
After September, 1970, each class of
entering freshmen will no longer be able
to take ROTC for credit. After
September, 1973, when four successive
freshman classes will have entered
Stanford, no student will be granted
credit for ROTC courses taken and
ROTC will have the status of an
extracurricular activity. During this four
year transition period, ROTC
instructors will have the official title,
"Lecturer with Rank of Professor."
After September, 1973, they will lose
faculty status.
The faculty action against ROTC
credit had its root in a September, 1967
recommendation to the Academic
Senate by English Assistant Professor
Anne Kostelanetz and nine other
faculty members.
The group asked that Academic
Credit be abolished for ROTC courses
and that military training and education
be restricted to off-campus. The Senate
instituted a nine-member Ad-Hoc
Committee on ROTC, for the purpose
of more closely studying its relationship
to the University.
Committee Members
The committee included George
Cattermole. Prof. Tom Connolly, Mark
Edwards, Tom Grissom, Prof.
Kostelanetz, Joseph Carrato, Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, and Col.
Robert Thomas.
Last February 12, the committee
released a majority report of six
members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

In an unprecedented and unexpected
move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.
Move On Encina
Only moments before the first squad
of police moved into Encina, the hectic
meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was

immediately informed of the vote to
leave and he yelled at the police to stop.
Other faculty members joined in the
call, and police officials intervened,
ordering their officers to stop.
For a tense 10 minutes, the
demonstrators gathered their belongings
as the police grew increasingly
impatient. Finally, the police informed
University officials that they would
have to implement their order to arrest
students. Moments later the
demonstrators left.
Demonstrators Leave
The last demonstrators left Encina at
about 7:25 a.m. leaving some 70 police
inside the building. The police canvassed
the sandstone structure but made no
arrests.
The demonstrators formed on the
west Encina Hall lawn where they
spotted President Pitzer and Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff. About
half the demonstrators, joined with
many other bystanders, then
surrounded Pitzer and Schiff asking
them why police had been summoned
onto the campus.
Pitzer responded that the University
had attempted to deal with the sit-in
through the established internal judicial
procedures, but that the demonstrators
had not respected them leaving the
University with no recourse but to call
on outside police to clear the building.
"We've been just as patient as we
could be. We've tried to use internal
judicial procedures; you've not
recognized these ... It was the only
thing left to do," Pitzer said to the
crowd.
The response of the demonstrators
was quite vocal with taunts such as
"President Pig-sir," "Professor
Bullshift," and "fuck you" being
directed towrad Schiff and Pitzer.
In the meantime, some of the police
occupying Encina Hall had exited the
building though about forty still
remained inside. The demonstrators
then left Pitzer and Schiff and

proceeded to the steps of Encina Hall
where they held an impromptu meeting
for about forty minutes alter which
time about 80 demonstrators went to
President Pitzer's office in Building 10
on the Quad.
About 40 demonstrators packed into
the reception area of the President's
Office. They attempted to enter
the office area but were prevented by a
steel gate and doors guarded by plain
clothes Santa Clara police. The students
entered Building 10 after pushing past
Bill Wyman who tried to keep the door
closed. Occupation of the reception area
lasted seven minutes.
The group then returned to the steps
of Encina Hall to continue their
meeting. In the meantime the San Jose
police had departed, going to the
Stanford police station where they
rested up and drank coffee. About half
the Santa Clara officers remained in the
building and half in a waiting bus.
A little later, University assistant
business manager deYoung announced
to the crowd outside the building that
Encina Hall had been declared a
restricted area open only to those
having legitimate business there. He
stated that legitimate business, in cases
of doubt, would be determined by the
administration.
Immediately thereafter the police
left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.

included the possibility of reoccupying

and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.
Move On Encina
Only moments before the first squad
of police moved into Encina, the hectic
meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was

immediately informed of the vote to
leave and he yelled at the police to stop.
Other faculty members joined in the
call, and police officials intervened,
ordering their officers to stop.
For a tense 10 minutes, the
demonstrators gathered their belongings
as the police grew increasingly
impatient. Finally, the police informed
University officials that they would
have to implement their order to arrest
students. Moments later the
demonstrators left.
Demonstrators Leave
The last demonstrators left Encina at
about 7:25 a.m. leaving some 70 police
inside the building. The police canvassed
the sandstone structure but made no
arrests.
The demonstrators formed on the
west Encina Hall lawn where they
spotted President Pitzer and Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff. About
half the demonstrators, joined with
many other bystanders, then
surrounded Pitzer and Schiff asking
them why police had been summoned
onto the campus.
Pitzer responded that the University
had attempted to deal with the sit-in
through the established internal judicial
procedures, but that the demonstrators
had not respected them leaving the
University with no recourse but to call
on outside police to clear the building.
"We've been just as patient as we
could be. We've tried to use internal
judicial procedures; you've not
recognized these ... It was the only
thing left to do," Pitzer said to the
crowd.
The response of the demonstrators
was quite vocal with taunts such as
"President Pig-sir," "Professor
Bullshift," and "fuck you" being
directed towrad Schiff and Pitzer.
In the meantime, some of the police
occupying Encina Hall had exited the
building though about forty still
remained inside. The demonstrators
then left Pitzer and Schiff and

proceeded to the steps of Encina Hall
where they held an impromptu meeting
for about forty minutes alter which
time about 80 demonstrators went to
President Pitzer's office in Building 10
on the Quad.
About 40 demonstrators packed into
the reception area of the President's
Office. They attempted to enter
the office area but were prevented by a
steel gate and doors guarded by plain
clothes Santa Clara police. The students
entered Building 10 after pushing past
Bill Wyman who tried to keep the door
closed. Occupation of the reception area
lasted seven minutes.
The group then returned to the steps
of Encina Hall to continue their
meeting. In the meantime the San Jose
police had departed, going to the
Stanford police station where they
rested up and drank coffee. About half
the Santa Clara officers remained in the
building and half in a waiting bus.
A little later, University assistant
business manager deYoung announced
to the crowd outside the building that
Encina Hall had been declared a
restricted area open only to those
having legitimate business there. He
stated that legitimate business, in cases
of doubt, would be determined by the
administration.
Immediately thereafter the police
left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.
Talk among the demonstraotrs
included the possibility of reoccupying
Encina Hall as soon as the police left,
but sentiment was against this, in part
because of the small number of people
present. Considerable attention was
focused on reasons for the small turnout
of sit-inners with the lack of community
in recent April 3rd Movement meetings.
In a mail ballot, the Stanford faculty
has voted 403-356 to end academic
credit for military training and
education, starting with the 1970
freshman class, Academic Secretary H.
Donald Winbigler reported yesterday.
Their action is in accord with a 25-8
vote of the Senate of the Academic
Council Feb. 23.
The vote will not affect the 360
students now enrolled in ROTC
programs at Stanford. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer indicated he will
consult with the Department of
Defense, looking toward the
establishment of an appropriate
non-credit program.
Col. Stanley Ramey, head of Army
ROTC at Stanford, claimed that "the
purpose of the mail referendum was
that of asking that President Pitzer be
allowed to negotiate with the Defense
Department without restrictions being
placed on anyone." He added that "the
results of the referendum will make
negotiations very difficult."
Individual Mail Ballots
Nearly 1,000 professors received
individual mail ballots for the vote, in
the first such test of a major Senate
action. The appeal to the entire Faculty
resulted from a petition signed by 70
Faculty members.
On Feb. 24, a 3-2 majority of
students voting in a campus referendum
said "ROTC has a legitimate place on
campus and deserves support and credit
from the University for all those parts
of the program that are of genuine
academic interest."
The Senate vote called for the three
ROTC departments to be replaced by a
single armed forces office program "for
the purposes of administration,
counseling, and recruiting for reserve
officer training and education." It also
called for individual contracts between
Stanford students and the armed forces
to be revised to reflect actual practice,
which permits students to drop ROTC
scholarships without penalty during
their first two years.
After Next September
After September, 1970, each class of
entering freshmen will no longer be able
to take ROTC for credit. After
September, 1973, when four successive
freshman classes will have entered
Stanford, no student will be granted
credit for ROTC courses taken and
ROTC will have the status of an
extracurricular activity. During this four
year transition period, ROTC
instructors will have the official title,
"Lecturer with Rank of Professor."
After September, 1973, they will lose
faculty status.
The faculty action against ROTC
credit had its root in a September, 1967
recommendation to the Academic
Senate by English Assistant Professor
Anne Kostelanetz and nine other
faculty members.
The group asked that Academic
Credit be abolished for ROTC courses
and that military training and education
be restricted to off-campus. The Senate
instituted a nine-member Ad-Hoc
Committee on ROTC, for the purpose
of more closely studying its relationship
to the University.
Committee Members
The committee included George
Cattermole. Prof. Tom Connolly, Mark
Edwards, Tom Grissom, Prof.
Kostelanetz, Joseph Carrato, Vice
Provost E. Howard Brooks, and Col.
Robert Thomas.
Last February 12, the committee
released a majority report of six
members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

In an unprecedented and unexpected
move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.

members urging abolition of ROTC on
campus and denial of ROTC credit to
entering freshmen. A three-member
minority report urged that curriculum
and departmental modifications in
ROTC be instituted while retaining
credit for the program.
The next day, the Senate adopted
the portion of the majority report
urging abolition of ROTC credit. The
recommendation to move ROTC off
campus was referred back to committee.

In an unprecedented and unexpected
move, more than 125 Santa Clara
County and San Jose city police officers
rolled onto campus yesterday morning
in response to a University
administration request to remove 100
students occupying Encina Hall less
than seven hours after they began
sitting-in. No arrests were made as the
students, part of the April 3rd
Movement, left the building just as
police were about to move in to make
arrests at 7:30 a.m.
The departure of the students
climaxed a very tense thirty-five-minute
period in which faculty representatives
warned students to leave the building,
or face arrest. A university business
office representative then told students
they were illegally occupying the
building and finally a Santa Clara
County Deputy Sheriff ordered the
demonstrators to disperse "in the name
of the people of the State of
California."
The demonstrators held a hurried
meeting over whether to submit to
arrest, concluding just as police entered
the building momentarily without
faculty observers who had assembled to
"observe events" in Encina.
The chain of events was set off at
6:55 a.m. when five faculty members,
including Robert McAfee Brown of
religion, James Gibbons of electrical

engineering, Michael Wald of the law
school, Donald Kennedy of biology, and
Sanford Dornbusch of sociology,
approached the four-story building and
went to the second floor where most of
the demonstrators were sleeping.
Wald approached Fred Cohen and
told him that he had an announcement
to make. The demonstrators were
hurriedly assembled in a large office on
the second floor where Wald addressed
them, saying that he had had personal
qualms about addressing the group but
had decided he had an obligation to do
so.
He told them that a significant
portion of the community opposed the
goals of the sit-inners and that police
would be arriving within fifteen minutes
to arrest any one who remained in the
building. He also said that the first
contingent of police would appear in
two or three minutes to warn
demonstrators to leave the building.
Warnings Given
Shortly thereafter, assistant business
manager Dan deYoung identified
himself and addressed the sit-inners,
saying "You are not welcome here. You
are here illegally. You are creating a
disturbance. Tf you don't leave, I will
order your arrest." His announcement
was greeted with jeers from some of
those present. He was immediately
followed at 6:59 a.m. by Santa Clara
deputy sheriff C.D. Marron who, after
identifying himself, announced, over a
portable loudspeaker, "I declare this an
unlawful assembly. In the name of the
people of the State of California I
command you to disperse."
They repeated the announcement at
least a dozen times before leaving the
building. The announcements led to a
meeting of all occupants of the building.
(See related story.)
Meanwhile, outside the building
some fifty faculty members had
gathered to observe the expected
arrests. An agreement had been made
between Santa Clara officials and the
University that a faculty member would
accompany each team of four police
officers into the building.
The faculty gathered on the Encina
lawn included many members of the
Academic Senate (all of whom were
contacted and asked to be present with
any colleagues they cared to invite),
members of the faculty committee on
disruptions and several deans as well as
President Pitzer.
Police Arrive
At approximately 7:15 three buses
pulled up in front of Encina Hall and
discharged some 125 officers, about
evenly split between Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and San Jose city
police. The San Jose police formed in
front of the building in a long line with
a few officers on either flank. The Santa
Clara officers formed into platoons and
prepared to enter the building.
The police were equipped with three
and four-foot long riot batons, tear gas
masks (which were kept in their
carriers), helmets with plexiglass face
masks, sidearms and, in at least several
instances, chemical Mace.
Police soon entered the building
catching faculty observeis off guard.
The faculty scrambled after the police
and gathered in the vestibule of the
building with the police.
Move On Encina
Only moments before the first squad
of police moved into Encina, the hectic
meeting of students ended with a vote
to leave the building. The police,
following orders to arrest anyone in the
building, headed upstairs, in ignorance
of the vote.
The police, for the first few seconds,
were not accompanied by faculty
members, the latter being caught off
guard outside when the police failed to
pause to organize with faculty planning
to observe arrests.
The first faculty member into Encina
was Halsted Holman. He was

immediately informed of the vote to
leave and he yelled at the police to stop.
Other faculty members joined in the
call, and police officials intervened,
ordering their officers to stop.
For a tense 10 minutes, the
demonstrators gathered their belongings
as the police grew increasingly
impatient. Finally, the police informed
University officials that they would
have to implement their order to arrest
students. Moments later the
demonstrators left.
Demonstrators Leave
The last demonstrators left Encina at
about 7:25 a.m. leaving some 70 police
inside the building. The police canvassed
the sandstone structure but made no
arrests.
The demonstrators formed on the
west Encina Hall lawn where they
spotted President Pitzer and Academic
Senate chairman Leonard Schiff. About
half the demonstrators, joined with
many other bystanders, then
surrounded Pitzer and Schiff asking
them why police had been summoned
onto the campus.
Pitzer responded that the University
had attempted to deal with the sit-in
through the established internal judicial
procedures, but that the demonstrators
had not respected them leaving the
University with no recourse but to call
on outside police to clear the building.
"We've been just as patient as we
could be. We've tried to use internal
judicial procedures; you've not
recognized these ... It was the only
thing left to do," Pitzer said to the
crowd.
The response of the demonstrators
was quite vocal with taunts such as
"President Pig-sir," "Professor
Bullshift," and "fuck you" being
directed towrad Schiff and Pitzer.
In the meantime, some of the police
occupying Encina Hall had exited the
building though about forty still
remained inside. The demonstrators
then left Pitzer and Schiff and

proceeded to the steps of Encina Hall
where they held an impromptu meeting
for about forty minutes alter which
time about 80 demonstrators went to
President Pitzer's office in Building 10
on the Quad.
About 40 demonstrators packed into
the reception area of the President's
Office. They attempted to enter
the office area but were prevented by a
steel gate and doors guarded by plain
clothes Santa Clara police. The students
entered Building 10 after pushing past
Bill Wyman who tried to keep the door
closed. Occupation of the reception area
lasted seven minutes.
The group then returned to the steps
of Encina Hall to continue their
meeting. In the meantime the San Jose
police had departed, going to the
Stanford police station where they
rested up and drank coffee. About half
the Santa Clara officers remained in the
building and half in a waiting bus.
A little later, University assistant
business manager deYoung announced
to the crowd outside the building that
Encina Hall had been declared a
restricted area open only to those
having legitimate business there. He
stated that legitimate business, in cases
of doubt, would be determined by the
administration.
Immediately thereafter the police
left the building boarded another
waiting bus and drove off to the
Stanford Police station before leaving
campus.
The demonstrators decided to leave
the Encina steps after voting to have a
meeting of the April 3rd Movement at
7:30 last night.
Talk among the demonstraotrs
included the possibility of reoccupying
Encina Hall as soon as the police left,
but sentiment was against this, in part
because of the small number of people
present. Considerable attention was
focused on reasons for the small turnout
of sit-inners with the lack of community
in recent April 3rd Movement meetings.
