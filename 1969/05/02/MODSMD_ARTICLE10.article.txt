# The 						Exercise Of Power
## 
### 
David W. Jones

Wednesday's move on Encina
Hall was graver than a tactical
error. It represented a substantive
change in the tactics and
expressed world view of the April
Third Movement from
non-violence to the minimum of
force necessary.
The Movement, I feel, has
concluded that without the
exercise of power the priorities of
the University and its
decision-making process cannot be
affected. That is probably a
legitimate assumption: the
Trustees have one again proved
themselves to be distant, arrogant
and unresponsive men more
concerned with a hearing
procedure borrowed from their
board of directors meetings than
with the will or the welfare of the
university community.
In a private conversation
Trustee Guggenheim indicated
that he could make no statements
without the green light from W.
Palmer Fuller 111, further, that he
was still without sufficient
information to make a decision
which might effect the national
security.
The thrust of Guggenheim's
remarks and the attitude of the
Trustees indicate that their point
of reference is clearly internal:
their views and their interests
rather than the mandate of this
community.
The power analysis also applied
to the recalcitrance of the faculty
of this University. The faculty
does not move without the
pin-prick of crisis. The pin-prick is
then interpreted as bludgeoning
and used as the excuse for futher
inaction: "we will not be
coerced." Hence, the faculty
Wednesday were more concerned
with subverting the sit-in than
with demonstrating the viability
of the Academic Senate as an
instrument for necessary change.
The Senate's past and future
deliberations were offered as a
carrot, not as a commitment to
ending the University's
involvement in America's
ethno-centric and coercive role
abroad.
Thus, I basically agree with the
Movement's analysis that- only
power will generate change in this
community. Only crisis disrupts
the ordinary routine of
self-service—But what kind of
power and what kind of crisis?
The Movement has sought to
use power to touch the distant
Trustees and move the recalcitrant
faculty. Power is a funny thing
though. It is power to build or
power to destroy. It can be used
legitimately or illegitimately.

Power was used Wednesday in a
manner which I can only believe
was arrogant and destructive. It
was used for the sake of building a
"radical consciousness" and in the
process violated the spirit of that
consciousness.
Three phrases have dominated
the rhetoric of the April Third
Movement: "Power to The
People," "Right On," and
"Struggle." The first is a cliche for
an extremely important concept:
the principle of self
determination, the right of
individuals to determine their own
lives and their own life-styles free
of institutional control within the
limits of mutual respect for
human dignity.
Then there are "Right On" and
"Struggle." They evoke a vivid
sense of unity with Che andHuey
and Mao. The identification is
with the people: the poor, the
hungry, those without power who
are bombed and strafed and killed
in our international game of
Dominoes and our domestic game
of Monopoly.
The thought behind the
rhetoric is democratic: man
should be free and he should have
the food and the learning and the
power to exercise his freedom.
Wednesday's action was not
democratic—it violated the spirit
of the Movement and obscured if
not torpedoed its demands. It was
an illegitimate exercise of power
because it did not come from the
people.
The sit-in decision was
manipulated. Four members of
the Movement, myself included,
set the Trustees up for a fall in
our testimony to their travesty of
a hearing. Then, in a extremely
bitter Movement meeting, BSU
member Dave Edwards used the
credibility of black anger to
channel discussion of alternatives
into a hasty yes-no vote on
seizing a building. The vote
carried two-to-one but that
majority was only 450 out of
1300-plus who signed the April
Third's solidarity statement in
AEL. And, it was no community
which made the decision—it was
an angry, frustrated and
embittered crowd with little
respect for each other.
A decision for a coercive
act—the taking of Encina
Hall—has little legitimacy, either
moral or political when it does
not derive from the consent of the
community. It will not serve, as
AEL did, to make the community
aware of the issues.
The community is aware, it has
voted and preponderantly in favor
of the Movement's demands: that

vote is power. But that power was
difused by the arrogance of the
Movement's presumption to be
moral arbiter of the community.
Ilts further presumption that only
coercion was an effective action
was also an assumption that the
remainder of the community
doesn't care. I believe that the
initial sit-in was necessary to
inform the community, to make it
care, to give it the information on
which to make its decision. But
now, the principles of
self-determination and personal
integrity demand that that
community's decision be
honored—by the faculty, the
Trustees AND THE APRIL
THIRD MOVEMENT.
Wednesday was not the time
for coercion. It was the time for
the Trustees to consult with SRl's
staff for systematic definition of
counter-insurgency and
war-related research and for
communication with the Faculty
Senate. It was the time for an
expression of confidence in the
power of the people, confidence
in the entire community. It was
also the time for the careful and
systematic promulgation of
realistic proposals that will serve
this University when it is not a
battleground, but once again a
community of learning.
Only a united community,
confident of its purpose, can
move the Trustees.
That means, I submit, that the
demands must be sophisticated.
The faculty must be convinced
that they have validity by
academic standards, that they can
be implemented without
endangering academic freedom
and free critique.
And, our fellow students must
have the confidence that support
of the Movement does not mean
the support of violence, radical
analysis, or manipulative politics.
I joined a humanist movement,
not a revolution.
Something has been lost since
AEL. I think it is respect—respect
for each other and for the oother
members of this community. If
our demands are to be met, if we
are to be able to exercise
legitimate power, we must not
lose touch of the assumptions
behind the movement. We must
begin to rebuild a sense of
community; we must re-affirm
non-violence; and we must take
very seriously the principle of
self-determination and apply it to
this community.

respect for each other.
A decision for a coercive
act—the taking of Encina
Hall—has little legitimacy, either
moral or political when it does
not derive from the consent of the
community. It will not serve, as
AEL did, to make the community
aware of the issues.
The community is aware, it has
voted and preponderantly in favor
of the Movement's demands: that

vote is power. But that power was
difused by the arrogance of the
Movement's presumption to be
moral arbiter of the community.
Ilts further presumption that only
coercion was an effective action
was also an assumption that the
remainder of the community
doesn't care. I believe that the
initial sit-in was necessary to
inform the community, to make it
care, to give it the information on
which to make its decision. But
now, the principles of
self-determination and personal
integrity demand that that
community's decision be
honored—by the faculty, the
Trustees AND THE APRIL
THIRD MOVEMENT.
Wednesday was not the time
for coercion. It was the time for
the Trustees to consult with SRl's
staff for systematic definition of
counter-insurgency and
war-related research and for
communication with the Faculty
Senate. It was the time for an
expression of confidence in the
power of the people, confidence
in the entire community. It was
also the time for the careful and
systematic promulgation of
realistic proposals that will serve
this University when it is not a
battleground, but once again a
community of learning.
Only a united community,
confident of its purpose, can
move the Trustees.
That means, I submit, that the
demands must be sophisticated.
The faculty must be convinced
that they have validity by
academic standards, that they can
be implemented without
endangering academic freedom
and free critique.
And, our fellow students must
have the confidence that support
of the Movement does not mean
the support of violence, radical
analysis, or manipulative politics.
I joined a humanist movement,
not a revolution.
Something has been lost since
AEL. I think it is respect—respect
for each other and for the oother
members of this community. If
our demands are to be met, if we
are to be able to exercise
legitimate power, we must not
lose touch of the assumptions
behind the movement. We must
begin to rebuild a sense of
community; we must re-affirm
non-violence; and we must take
very seriously the principle of
self-determination and apply it to
this community.

Wednesday's move on Encina
Hall was graver than a tactical
error. It represented a substantive
change in the tactics and
expressed world view of the April
Third Movement from
non-violence to the minimum of
force necessary.
The Movement, I feel, has
concluded that without the
exercise of power the priorities of
the University and its
decision-making process cannot be
affected. That is probably a
legitimate assumption: the
Trustees have one again proved
themselves to be distant, arrogant
and unresponsive men more
concerned with a hearing
procedure borrowed from their
board of directors meetings than
with the will or the welfare of the
university community.
In a private conversation
Trustee Guggenheim indicated
that he could make no statements
without the green light from W.
Palmer Fuller 111, further, that he
was still without sufficient
information to make a decision
which might effect the national
security.
The thrust of Guggenheim's
remarks and the attitude of the
Trustees indicate that their point
of reference is clearly internal:
their views and their interests
rather than the mandate of this
community.
The power analysis also applied
to the recalcitrance of the faculty
of this University. The faculty
does not move without the
pin-prick of crisis. The pin-prick is
then interpreted as bludgeoning
and used as the excuse for futher
inaction: "we will not be
coerced." Hence, the faculty
Wednesday were more concerned
with subverting the sit-in than
with demonstrating the viability
of the Academic Senate as an
instrument for necessary change.
The Senate's past and future
deliberations were offered as a
carrot, not as a commitment to
ending the University's
involvement in America's
ethno-centric and coercive role
abroad.
Thus, I basically agree with the
Movement's analysis that- only
power will generate change in this
community. Only crisis disrupts
the ordinary routine of
self-service—But what kind of
power and what kind of crisis?
The Movement has sought to
use power to touch the distant
Trustees and move the recalcitrant
faculty. Power is a funny thing
though. It is power to build or
power to destroy. It can be used
legitimately or illegitimately.

Power was used Wednesday in a
manner which I can only believe
was arrogant and destructive. It
was used for the sake of building a
"radical consciousness" and in the
process violated the spirit of that
consciousness.
Three phrases have dominated
the rhetoric of the April Third
Movement: "Power to The
People," "Right On," and
"Struggle." The first is a cliche for
an extremely important concept:
the principle of self
determination, the right of
individuals to determine their own
lives and their own life-styles free
of institutional control within the
limits of mutual respect for
human dignity.
Then there are "Right On" and
"Struggle." They evoke a vivid
sense of unity with Che andHuey
and Mao. The identification is
with the people: the poor, the
hungry, those without power who
are bombed and strafed and killed
in our international game of
Dominoes and our domestic game
of Monopoly.
The thought behind the
rhetoric is democratic: man
should be free and he should have
the food and the learning and the
power to exercise his freedom.
Wednesday's action was not
democratic—it violated the spirit
of the Movement and obscured if
not torpedoed its demands. It was
an illegitimate exercise of power
because it did not come from the
people.
The sit-in decision was
manipulated. Four members of
the Movement, myself included,
set the Trustees up for a fall in
our testimony to their travesty of
a hearing. Then, in a extremely
bitter Movement meeting, BSU
member Dave Edwards used the
credibility of black anger to
channel discussion of alternatives
into a hasty yes-no vote on
seizing a building. The vote
carried two-to-one but that
majority was only 450 out of
1300-plus who signed the April
Third's solidarity statement in
AEL. And, it was no community
which made the decision—it was
an angry, frustrated and
embittered crowd with little
respect for each other.
A decision for a coercive

The Senate's past and future
deliberations were offered as a
carrot, not as a commitment to
ending the University's
involvement in America's
ethno-centric and coercive role
abroad.
Thus, I basically agree with the
Movement's analysis that- only
power will generate change in this
community. Only crisis disrupts
the ordinary routine of
self-service—But what kind of
power and what kind of crisis?
The Movement has sought to
use power to touch the distant
Trustees and move the recalcitrant
faculty. Power is a funny thing
though. It is power to build or
power to destroy. It can be used
legitimately or illegitimately.

Power was used Wednesday in a
manner which I can only believe
was arrogant and destructive. It
was used for the sake of building a
"radical consciousness" and in the
process violated the spirit of that
consciousness.
Three phrases have dominated
the rhetoric of the April Third
Movement: "Power to The
People," "Right On," and
"Struggle." The first is a cliche for
an extremely important concept:
the principle of self
determination, the right of
individuals to determine their own
lives and their own life-styles free
of institutional control within the
limits of mutual respect for
human dignity.
Then there are "Right On" and
"Struggle." They evoke a vivid
sense of unity with Che andHuey
and Mao. The identification is
with the people: the poor, the
hungry, those without power who
are bombed and strafed and killed
in our international game of
Dominoes and our domestic game
of Monopoly.
The thought behind the
rhetoric is democratic: man
should be free and he should have
the food and the learning and the
power to exercise his freedom.
Wednesday's action was not
democratic—it violated the spirit
of the Movement and obscured if
not torpedoed its demands. It was
an illegitimate exercise of power
because it did not come from the
people.
The sit-in decision was
manipulated. Four members of
the Movement, myself included,
set the Trustees up for a fall in
our testimony to their travesty of
a hearing. Then, in a extremely
bitter Movement meeting, BSU
member Dave Edwards used the
credibility of black anger to
channel discussion of alternatives
into a hasty yes-no vote on
seizing a building. The vote
carried two-to-one but that
majority was only 450 out of
1300-plus who signed the April
Third's solidarity statement in
AEL. And, it was no community
which made the decision—it was
an angry, frustrated and
embittered crowd with little
respect for each other.
A decision for a coercive
act—the taking of Encina
Hall—has little legitimacy, either
moral or political when it does
not derive from the consent of the
community. It will not serve, as
AEL did, to make the community
aware of the issues.
The community is aware, it has
voted and preponderantly in favor
of the Movement's demands: that

vote is power. But that power was
difused by the arrogance of the
Movement's presumption to be
moral arbiter of the community.
Ilts further presumption that only
coercion was an effective action
was also an assumption that the
remainder of the community
doesn't care. I believe that the
initial sit-in was necessary to
inform the community, to make it
care, to give it the information on
which to make its decision. But
now, the principles of
self-determination and personal
integrity demand that that
community's decision be
honored—by the faculty, the
Trustees AND THE APRIL
THIRD MOVEMENT.
Wednesday was not the time
for coercion. It was the time for
the Trustees to consult with SRl's
staff for systematic definition of
counter-insurgency and
war-related research and for
communication with the Faculty
Senate. It was the time for an
expression of confidence in the
power of the people, confidence
in the entire community. It was
also the time for the careful and
systematic promulgation of
realistic proposals that will serve
this University when it is not a
battleground, but once again a
community of learning.
Only a united community,
confident of its purpose, can
move the Trustees.
That means, I submit, that the
demands must be sophisticated.
The faculty must be convinced
that they have validity by
academic standards, that they can
be implemented without
endangering academic freedom
and free critique.
And, our fellow students must
have the confidence that support
of the Movement does not mean
the support of violence, radical
analysis, or manipulative politics.
I joined a humanist movement,
not a revolution.
Something has been lost since
AEL. I think it is respect—respect
for each other and for the oother
members of this community. If
our demands are to be met, if we
are to be able to exercise
legitimate power, we must not
lose touch of the assumptions
behind the movement. We must
begin to rebuild a sense of
community; we must re-affirm
non-violence; and we must take
very seriously the principle of
self-determination and apply it to
this community.

Wednesday's move on Encina
Hall was graver than a tactical
error. It represented a substantive
change in the tactics and
expressed world view of the April
Third Movement from
non-violence to the minimum of
force necessary.
The Movement, I feel, has
concluded that without the
exercise of power the priorities of
the University and its
decision-making process cannot be
affected. That is probably a
legitimate assumption: the
Trustees have one again proved
themselves to be distant, arrogant
and unresponsive men more
concerned with a hearing
procedure borrowed from their
board of directors meetings than
with the will or the welfare of the
university community.
In a private conversation
Trustee Guggenheim indicated
that he could make no statements
without the green light from W.
Palmer Fuller 111, further, that he
was still without sufficient
information to make a decision
which might effect the national
security.
The thrust of Guggenheim's
remarks and the attitude of the
Trustees indicate that their point
of reference is clearly internal:
their views and their interests
rather than the mandate of this
community.
The power analysis also applied
to the recalcitrance of the faculty
of this University. The faculty
does not move without the
pin-prick of crisis. The pin-prick is
then interpreted as bludgeoning
and used as the excuse for futher
inaction: "we will not be
coerced." Hence, the faculty
Wednesday were more concerned
with subverting the sit-in than
with demonstrating the viability
of the Academic Senate as an
instrument for necessary change.
The Senate's past and future
deliberations were offered as a
carrot, not as a commitment to

move the Trustees.
That means, I submit, that the
demands must be sophisticated.
The faculty must be convinced
that they have validity by
academic standards, that they can
be implemented without
endangering academic freedom
and free critique.
And, our fellow students must
have the confidence that support
of the Movement does not mean
the support of violence, radical
analysis, or manipulative politics.
I joined a humanist movement,
not a revolution.
Something has been lost since
AEL. I think it is respect—respect
for each other and for the oother
members of this community. If
our demands are to be met, if we
are to be able to exercise
legitimate power, we must not
lose touch of the assumptions
behind the movement. We must
begin to rebuild a sense of
community; we must re-affirm
non-violence; and we must take
very seriously the principle of
self-determination and apply it to
this community.
