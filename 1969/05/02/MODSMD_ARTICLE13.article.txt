## Toward A New Community? 
### Bruce Campbell 
Wednesday afternoon, I went
to the Chemical Engineering
building to deliver a proposal to
one of the University Fellows,
Robert Madix.
I found the doors locked.
Walking around outside the
building, I located a secretary and
asked her how I could get in.
"You're not going to sit in, are
you?" she asked fearfully. "No," I
said, "I just want to leave a paper
with a professor." "Then bang on
the doors until someone comes
and opens.them."
I did and soon a grad student
came over, opened the door with
great apprehension and said: "Do
you have a pass." Someone else
assured him I didn't need one. I
left my paper with the
departmental secretary, since Mr.
Madix was out of town. I asked
her why the building was locked.
She told me "A lot of the
engineering buildings have been
locked as protection against a
sit-in." I staggered out, the image
of fear-ridden eyes in my mind.
Police On Campus
Waking Thursday morning to
the news that police had been
brought on the campus and that
groups of students were
wandering around apparently
aimlessly brought to mind the
incident at the engineering
building and the conviction that
whatever the April 3rd Movement
did to sensitize the campus to
moral issues in research, its
ultimate impact may be harmful.
When there are guards around the
Astronautics and Aeronautics
building and when other buildings
are locked at 3 p.m., then

Stanford has taken a large and
regrettable step backwards.
The primary element in
community is trust. Once that has
been killed, there is nothing to
hold a group of people together if
someone wants to push the
situation to its inevitable
conclusion. The whole enterprise
will be brought to a halt. And at
what price? The dehumanization
of all parties involved.
Eldridge Cleaver says that
whenever you treat a person as
less than human, you are making
yourself less than human. The
April 3rd Movement has thrived
on acts of dehumanization: the
Trustees and the President have
been made into hate-objects. What
has that done to the haters? A
large number of persons in
engineering are fearful. What does
that do to the fear-inspirers?
Many people cannot trust. What
does that do to the
trust-underminers?
Priorities Confused
The April 3rd Movement has
lost sight of its priorities. No end
is so important that it justifies the
destruction of community, the
demolition of trust, the
objectification of other human
beings.
Writing in Commonweal
magazine in May, 1968, Herbert
Richardson called Martin Luther
King., "the most important
theologian of our time." We are
plagued today, he writes, with a
secular form of gnosticism: the
belief that some people have the
inside knowledge unavailable to
others. This is relativism: the
opposition within a single natural

order between "those who truly
understand the meaning of life
and those who do not." King is
important because of his creative
proposals for dealing with the evil
generated by relativism:
ideological conflict.
Against the backdrop of such
conflict, faith is the power of
reconciliation which works to
unite the many relative
perspectives and to thwart
ideological conflict. It is the
commitment to oppose the
separation of man from man.
Martin Luther King's struggle
was directed against the forces or
structures of evil rather than
against the person or group doing
the evil. In order to overcome evil,
faith does not attack the men who
do evil, but the structure of evil
which makes men act violently.
"Hate begets hate; violence begets
violence'' King said in
Montgomery. "Our aim must
never be to defeat or humiliate
the white man, but to win his
friendship and understanding."
The goal of the struggle against
evil is the total interrelatedness of
man with man. Brotherhood is the
ultimate value of human life.
The April 3rd Movement seems
to have lost sight of this value.
For the sake of an immediate end,
it is willing to sacrifice the
ultimate end. In order to save
humanity in Southeast Asia, it is
necessary to destroy Stanford.
Is the Movement pointing in
the direction of a "new
community"? True community is
not a "we" against a "they." It
can only be we.

the doors until someone comes
and opens.them."
I did and soon a grad student
came over, opened the door with
great apprehension and said: "Do
you have a pass." Someone else
assured him I didn't need one. I
left my paper with the
departmental secretary, since Mr.
Madix was out of town. I asked
her why the building was locked.
She told me "A lot of the
engineering buildings have been
locked as protection against a
sit-in." I staggered out, the image

Police On Campus
Waking Thursday morning to
the news that police had been
brought on the campus and that
groups of students were
wandering around apparently
aimlessly brought to mind the
incident at the engineering
building and the conviction that
whatever the April 3rd Movement
did to sensitize the campus to
moral issues in research, its
ultimate impact may be harmful.
When there are guards around the
Astronautics and Aeronautics
building and when other buildings
are locked at 3 p.m., then

Stanford has taken a large and
regrettable step backwards.
The primary element in
community is trust. Once that has
been killed, there is nothing to
hold a group of people together if
someone wants to push the
situation to its inevitable
conclusion. The whole enterprise
will be brought to a halt. And at
what price? The dehumanization
of all parties involved.
Eldridge Cleaver says that
whenever you treat a person as
less than human, you are making
yourself less than human. The
April 3rd Movement has thrived
on acts of dehumanization: the
Trustees and the President have
been made into hate-objects. What
has that done to the haters? A
large number of persons in
engineering are fearful. What does
that do to the fear-inspirers?
Many people cannot trust. What
does that do to the
trust-underminers?
Priorities Confused
The April 3rd Movement has
lost sight of its priorities. No end
is so important that it justifies the
destruction of community, the
demolition of trust, the
objectification of other human
beings.
Writing in Commonweal
magazine in May, 1968, Herbert
Richardson called Martin Luther
King., "the most important
theologian of our time." We are
plagued today, he writes, with a
secular form of gnosticism: the
belief that some people have the
inside knowledge unavailable to
others. This is relativism: the
opposition within a single natural

order between "those who truly
understand the meaning of life
and those who do not." King is
important because of his creative
proposals for dealing with the evil
generated by relativism:
ideological conflict.
Against the backdrop of such
conflict, faith is the power of
reconciliation which works to
unite the many relative
perspectives and to thwart
ideological conflict. It is the
commitment to oppose the
separation of man from man.
Martin Luther King's struggle
was directed against the forces or
structures of evil rather than
against the person or group doing
the evil. In order to overcome evil,
faith does not attack the men who
do evil, but the structure of evil
which makes men act violently.
"Hate begets hate; violence begets
violence'' King said in
Montgomery. "Our aim must
never be to defeat or humiliate
the white man, but to win his
friendship and understanding."
The goal of the struggle against
evil is the total interrelatedness of
man with man. Brotherhood is the
ultimate value of human life.
The April 3rd Movement seems
to have lost sight of this value.
For the sake of an immediate end,
it is willing to sacrifice the
ultimate end. In order to save
humanity in Southeast Asia, it is
necessary to destroy Stanford.
Is the Movement pointing in
the direction of a "new
community"? True community is
not a "we" against a "they." It
can only be we.
(Bruce Campbell is a former
staff member of the Study of
Education at Stanford-Ed.)
Wednesday afternoon, I went
to the Chemical Engineering
building to deliver a proposal to
one of the University Fellows,
Robert Madix.
I found the doors locked.
Walking around outside the
building, I located a secretary and
asked her how I could get in.
"You're not going to sit in, are
you?" she asked fearfully. "No," I
said, "I just want to leave a paper
with a professor." "Then bang on
the doors until someone comes
and opens.them."

came over, opened the door with
great apprehension and said: "Do
