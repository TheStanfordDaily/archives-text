## Stanford Must Change 
### Greg Martinelli 
Implicit in the attacks on
faculty, administrators, and
Trustees is the notion that these
individuals solely control the
university and its fate. After
seeing the university in the
context of American society, I am
skeptical of this assumption. No
university is autonomous. Yes,
Stanford is privateâ€”but subject to
private interests. And it is these
private interests that determine
the nature of relationships within
the university.
They are also committed to
profit and must of necessity
accommodate themselves to the
dicta of federal power. Our
opponent becomes the ideology
of the corporation and the
military reflected by the federal
government. And the Trustee is its
liason.
The poverty of political
sophistication evidenced by SDS
as well as other student parties
never ceases to be a source of
exasperation. It is very easy to
become righteous in one's
convictions, to believe that only
his power is legitimate. But when
moral indignation distorts
perspective, its motivational force
becomes self-defeating. Western
society has built itself upon a
rationalist tradition which has
led to an almost total
in tellectualization of any
emotional response.
Our political realities were
designed by men, and if we want
to change them, we cannot deny
these men any moral sensitivity. It

is expedient to deal with faceless
individuals; confrontation
becomes one-dimensional when
we neglect the humanity of those
we confront. This is true for
BOTH sides. It has become an
absurd contest between factions:
engineers against non-engineers,
SDS against YAF, students against
faculty, students against Trustees,
faceless individuals against other
faceless individuals. Confrontation
has become depersonalized and
therefore of limited effect.
When relations between people
become objectified, they become
tinged with falsehood. This
prohibits dialogue: when there is
no dialogue, change must be
effected through violent power
conflicts.
We have pushed the Trustees
against the wall. But the existence
of that wall demonstrates the lack
of mobility and freedom that
exists throughout the whole
university and all of society. We
here are also within the confines
of that wall. And to raze that
barrier, the present nature of the
university must be changed. The
supposed role of the university
was to be the vanguard of social
change; instead, it has become a
mere appendage of society,
reflecting its attitudes and values.
The private university is less
controlled than the "multiversity,"
but it is still controlled by those
private interests whose security
rests on the status quo.
If the university is to be
relevant to society's dysfunctions,

it must be revolutionized. The
university now is sadly
inadequate. The problem has been
approached externally: the
symptoms have been attacked
instead of the illness. The
Trustees, whose existence has
been taken for granted, have been
attacked instead of their
relationship and relevance to the
university. If the relationship of
SRI to Stanford is to be redefined
effectively, the nature of the
respective institutions must be
changed.
And the relationship of the
university to society must be
changed.
