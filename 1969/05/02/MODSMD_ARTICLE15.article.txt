## On Sex Education 
### Art Buchwald 
There is a big flap going on in the United States right now over the
question of teaching Sex Education in our schools. The educators are
mostly for it and the ultraconservatives, including the John Birchers
and the DAR, are mostly against it. I usually like to stay out of
controversial matters as I hate to answer my mail, but in this case I have
to come out for teaching sex education in the schools.
This is a very personal matter with me. I had no formal sex
education when I was a student, and everyone knows the mess I'm in. If
there had been a Head Start program in sex education when I was going
to public school, I might have been a different man today.
When I was going to Public School 35 in Hollis, N.Y., we got all our
sex education at the local candy store after 3 o'clock. The information
was dispensed by 13-year-olds who seemed to know everything there
was to know on the subject, and we 11- and 12-year-olds believed every
word they told us.
Some of it, I discovered later on, did not necessarily happen to be
true. For example, I was told as an absolute fact that if a girl necked
with you in the rumble seat of a car, she would automatically have a
baby.
This kept me out of the rumble seat of an automobile until I was 23
years old.
There were some other canards of the day, including one that the
method of kissing a girl on the mouth decided whether she would
become pregnant or not. Every time I kissed a girl after that, I sweated
for the next nine months.
The sex experts at Sam's Candy Store had an answer for every
problem that was raised at the soda fountain. These included warnings
that if you did certain things you would go insane. Most of us were
prepared to be taken off to the booby hatch at any moment.
There was obviously no talk about birds, bees, flowers or animals.
We couldn't care less what happened when they were doing it. Our only
concern was what happened to human beings, and from what our
13-year-old instructors could tell us, it was all bad.
Those of us who escaped insantiy and shotgun weddings were told
we would probably wind up with a horrendous disease that would be
passed on to our children and their children for generations to come.
There were 25 ways of catching this disease, including shaking hands
with someone who knew someone who had it.
You can imagine the nightmares these tales produced. There seemed
to be no escape. You were doomed if you did, and you were doomed if
you didn't. After one of these sessions at the candy store, I seriously
contemplated suicide. There didn't seem to be any other way out.
Now the worst part of my sex indoctrination was that when I turned
13 I became an instructor myself and passed on my knowledge to 11-
and 12-year-olds at the same candy store. They listened in awe as I
repeated word for word what I had been told by my "teachers," and I
was amazed with how much authority I was able to pass on the "facts"
of sex education as I knew them.
Upon becoming 13, they in turn taught the younger students.
Heaven knows how many generations of Public School 35 alumni went
on through life believing everything they had learned about sex at
Sam's Candy Store.
The fact is that, while the sex education at Sam's served a purpose,
we were all emotional wrecks before we got to high school.
So, on the basis of my own experience, I don't think we have much
choice in this country when it comes to sex education. In order to
avoid the agony and pain my fellow classmates and I went through, we
either have to teach sex in the schools, or close down every soda
fountain in the United States.

and 12-year-olds at the same candy store. They listened in awe as I
repeated word for word what I had been told by my "teachers," and I
was amazed with how much authority I was able to pass on the "facts"
of sex education as I knew them.
Upon becoming 13, they in turn taught the younger students.
Heaven knows how many generations of Public School 35 alumni went
on through life believing everything they had learned about sex at
Sam's Candy Store.
The fact is that, while the sex education at Sam's served a purpose,
we were all emotional wrecks before we got to high school.
So, on the basis of my own experience, I don't think we have much
choice in this country when it comes to sex education. In order to
avoid the agony and pain my fellow classmates and I went through, we
either have to teach sex in the schools, or close down every soda
fountain in the United States.
There is a big flap going on in the United States right now over the
question of teaching Sex Education in our schools. The educators are
mostly for it and the ultraconservatives, including the John Birchers
and the DAR, are mostly against it. I usually like to stay out of
controversial matters as I hate to answer my mail, but in this case I have
to come out for teaching sex education in the schools.
This is a very personal matter with me. I had no formal sex
education when I was a student, and everyone knows the mess I'm in. If
there had been a Head Start program in sex education when I was going
to public school, I might have been a different man today.
When I was going to Public School 35 in Hollis, N.Y., we got all our
sex education at the local candy store after 3 o'clock. The information
was dispensed by 13-year-olds who seemed to know everything there
was to know on the subject, and we 11- and 12-year-olds believed every
word they told us.
Some of it, I discovered later on, did not necessarily happen to be
true. For example, I was told as an absolute fact that if a girl necked
with you in the rumble seat of a car, she would automatically have a
baby.
This kept me out of the rumble seat of an automobile until I was 23
years old.
There were some other canards of the day, including one that the
method of kissing a girl on the mouth decided whether she would
become pregnant or not. Every time I kissed a girl after that, I sweated
for the next nine months.
The sex experts at Sam's Candy Store had an answer for every
problem that was raised at the soda fountain. These included warnings
that if you did certain things you would go insane. Most of us were
prepared to be taken off to the booby hatch at any moment.
There was obviously no talk about birds, bees, flowers or animals.
We couldn't care less what happened when they were doing it. Our only
concern was what happened to human beings, and from what our
13-year-old instructors could tell us, it was all bad.
Those of us who escaped insantiy and shotgun weddings were told
we would probably wind up with a horrendous disease that would be
passed on to our children and their children for generations to come.
There were 25 ways of catching this disease, including shaking hands
with someone who knew someone who had it.
You can imagine the nightmares these tales produced. There seemed
to be no escape. You were doomed if you did, and you were doomed if
you didn't. After one of these sessions at the candy store, I seriously
contemplated suicide. There didn't seem to be any other way out.
Now the worst part of my sex indoctrination was that when I turned
13 I became an instructor myself and passed on my knowledge to 11-
and 12-year-olds at the same candy store. They listened in awe as I
repeated word for word what I had been told by my "teachers," and I
was amazed with how much authority I was able to pass on the "facts"
