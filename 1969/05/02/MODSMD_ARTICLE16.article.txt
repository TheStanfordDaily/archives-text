## Time To 'Stand Up And Take Action' 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I think that contrary to his
assertions to the faculty, Mr.
Pitzer favors "disruptions on the
Stanford campus." And he seems
to be wel! aware that in order i-o
get a great big, fiery crisis, one
simply stalls in the face of a few
small ones. One wavers, one
adjusts one's stand to one's
audience, one camoflages one's
own position with vague words
and empty phrases, and one is
"concerned" about "physical
destruction" while one promotes
the research which refines the
technology of destruction. And in
this way one builds an explosion
which makes headlines for the itsv
bitsy teeny weeny Stanford status
machine.
I say to Pitzer and Lyman and
the like—if you want status and a
pile of money, then go out like
men and seek it. Join Standard Oil
or United Fruit or Dow. It is the

small, spineless institutional men
like you who make wars while the
sun shines. You want your power
and authority without the risk of
seeking it openly. And so you
play the balance games. How can
you talk about "open inquiry and
free speech" when your mouths
are full of cotton evasions?
Our questions are simple an*,
crystal clear. Do you favor
continuation of CEW and
classified research at Stanford and
SRI? If not, then stand up with
the rest of us and take action.
Quivering really doesn't help.

Editor, THE DAILY:
A group of Stanford students,
both undergraduates and
graduates, with varying political

beliefs but with a background of
military experience, have
volunteered to talk with any other
Stanford students about the
prospect of military service. The
aim is to talk to individuals on a
man-to-man basis about the
realities of the service experience
as they saw it —from a viewpoint
that is distinct from both that of
the Resistance and that of the
professional military recruiters.
These volunteers are earnest in
their desire to add an additional
dimension to the thinking of
fellow Stanford men trying to
make a conscientious decision
regarding military service.
Any student who wishes to
talk to one of these ex-servicemen
should contact Mr. Bill Leland,
the Special Services Counselor, in
room 324, Old Union, for further
information.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I strongly protest the obviously
"loading" of the student speaking
panel for the Trustees meeting in
favor of the A3M community. To
the best of my estimation, 8 out
of the 12 alloted speakers were
apparently either directly or
indirectly associated with the
A3M.
In addition, one of the
announced speakers (Lincoln
Malik of the TWLF) was replaced
by another speaker of the same
group and allowed to illegally
expound his political views before
a group that was ostensibly

attempting to arrive at some
legitimate solution to the SRI
question. Even after the
appointed student speakers had
finished, the chairman of the
ASSU nominating committee saw
fit to include his own
interpretations of the meeting and
then proceeded to call upon even
two more members of the A3M
for their opinion, violating the
spirit and intent of the selection.
I feel such stacking procedure
(namely 11 out of 15) has grossly
distorted the proportionate
opinion of the Stanford student
body. My protest against this
tactic of A3M is small in
comparison to the outright
condemnation of the 6000-7000
Stanford students who, through
their own political inactivity, have
allowed such a situation to come
to pass.

A group of Stanford students,
both undergraduates and
graduates, with varying political

beliefs but with a background of
military experience, have
volunteered to talk with any other
Stanford students about the
prospect of military service. The
aim is to talk to individuals on a
man-to-man basis about the
realities of the service experience
as they saw it —from a viewpoint
that is distinct from both that of
the Resistance and that of the
professional military recruiters.
These volunteers are earnest in
their desire to add an additional
dimension to the thinking of
fellow Stanford men trying to
make a conscientious decision
regarding military service.
Any student who wishes to
talk to one of these ex-servicemen
should contact Mr. Bill Leland,
the Special Services Counselor, in
room 324, Old Union, for further
information.

I strongly protest the obviously
"loading" of the student speaking
panel for the Trustees meeting in
favor of the A3M community. To
the best of my estimation, 8 out
of the 12 alloted speakers were
apparently either directly or
indirectly associated with the
A3M.
In addition, one of the
announced speakers (Lincoln
Malik of the TWLF) was replaced
by another speaker of the same
group and allowed to illegally
expound his political views before
a group that was ostensibly

attempting to arrive at some
legitimate solution to the SRI
question. Even after the
appointed student speakers had
finished, the chairman of the
ASSU nominating committee saw
fit to include his own
interpretations of the meeting and
then proceeded to call upon even
two more members of the A3M
for their opinion, violating the
spirit and intent of the selection.
I feel such stacking procedure
(namely 11 out of 15) has grossly
distorted the proportionate
opinion of the Stanford student
body. My protest against this
tactic of A3M is small in
comparison to the outright
condemnation of the 6000-7000
Stanford students who, through
their own political inactivity, have
allowed such a situation to come
to pass.

I think that contrary to his
assertions to the faculty, Mr.
Pitzer favors "disruptions on the
Stanford campus." And he seems
to be wel! aware that in order i-o
get a great big, fiery crisis, one
simply stalls in the face of a few
small ones. One wavers, one
adjusts one's stand to one's
audience, one camoflages one's
own position with vague words
and empty phrases, and one is
"concerned" about "physical
destruction" while one promotes
the research which refines the
technology of destruction. And in
this way one builds an explosion
which makes headlines for the itsv
bitsy teeny weeny Stanford status
machine.
I say to Pitzer and Lyman and
the like—if you want status and a
pile of money, then go out like
men and seek it. Join Standard Oil
or United Fruit or Dow. It is the

small, spineless institutional men
like you who make wars while the
sun shines. You want your power
and authority without the risk of
seeking it openly. And so you
play the balance games. How can
you talk about "open inquiry and
free speech" when your mouths
are full of cotton evasions?
