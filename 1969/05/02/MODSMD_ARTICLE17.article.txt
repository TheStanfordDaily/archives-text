# Students' Reactions
## Encina Sit-In Questioned 
### BROOKE SHEARER DIANA WHEATLEY 
Deflated, frustrated,
disappointed, sorry, satisfied, and
confused, the Stanford
Community stumbled awake
yesterday in the aftermath of the
Encina Hall occupation-liberation.
"We're unhappy that it
happened," commented one
faculty member, "but it turned
out the way we thought it
would."
Few students and faculty are
able to articulate their feelings
about last night's events. Most
shake their heads in confused
frustration and shrug their
shoulders; they don't know what
to think.
Among those expressing their
feelings, views ranged from
dismay and condemnation of the
action to attempts to analyze its
meaning for the university. "It
was a premature movement. Most
people realize now that they made
the wrong decision," confided a
Movement activist.
"I'm Frightened"
Kate Baker, a freshman in
Paloma, expressed the sentiments
of many of the girls polled in her
house when she said: "I'm
frightened because the movement
is no longer the same; it has lost
sight of its original goals."

Another Paloma resident,
Bethann Frede, offered her
analysis that "no matter who
you're talking to, whether it is a
member of the April 3rd
Movement or people opposed to
the sit-in, they're not really trying
to understand how other factions
of the community feel."
Those shocked and unhappy
with the action included many
who said they were A3M members
or had participated in the sit-in at
AEL. A good number felt that the
SRI and research issues were in
grave danger of being
subordinated to the issue of
disruption.
Among Wilbur residents
interviewed, Catherine Cherbak,
who sat in at AEL, stated: "Talk
on campus will now be about
disruption rather than A3M goals.
The Trustees are now faced with
many hard and complicated
decisions. If it takes six hours to
decide to sit-in, it will and should
take the Trustees longer to make
their decisions."
Pedro Albarracin, a student
from Colombia, presented a
different view. "I am indifferent
to the events that are occurring
because of the indifference of
American students in general to
the people of Third World,"
he commented. "Â¥ou don't have

to approve of disturbances and
disruption to do something. Yet
the majority of the students
choose to do nothing."
There were also, however,
expressions of hope and
suggestions for the future of the
Movement.
One prominent member of the
campus ministry expressed
confidence in the Movement. "I
wonder," he said, "if the
Movement can keep itself intact,
if it can keep the issues before the
community, and if its place in the
clubhouse is enough."
"This sit-in," he continued,
"was different from the first. You
didn't have a number of things
going for you that you do now.
"First, Pitzer has been made to
declare himself in ways that one
might not have expected him to
do earlier this year.
"Two, the trustees have been
moved to restructure themselves.
"Three, You have had a
declaration from the Senate
forbidding classified research."

"Four, the Dean of
Engineering has been turned on
his ear. He's been clipped
permanently and he knows it. It's
phenomenal that quite so much
has been accomplished quite so
quickly."
Unfortunate, Regrettable
Gilbert Diaz, a senior in
political science, and a frequent
critic of the April 3rd Movement's
tactics and goals, termed the sit-in
the most ''unfortunate,
regrettable event in the history of
Stanford."
"The sit-in didn't surprise me,"
he continued, "the only question
was where it would take place."
Diaz praised the administration's
"very calm use of the police,"
adding that "these radical and
irrational actions should bring
immediate suspension" of those
involved.
The future of A3M itself is not
clear. The essential questions now
are the survival of the Movement
and its further course of action.
