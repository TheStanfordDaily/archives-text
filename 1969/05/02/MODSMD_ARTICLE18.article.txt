With great reluctance and genuine regret we have asked the
Sheriff's Office of Santa Clara County to assist us in bringing the
illegal and indefensible occupation of Encina Hall to an end.
We have taken this final step only after exhausting, without
success, every internal remedy available to the University, including
the Presidential emergency powers suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council. This decision was taken with the advice of and at
the unanimous recommendation of the President's Faculty
Consultative Group on Campus Disorders.
We want to assure the community that the rights of all persons
in Encina Hall are being scrupulously protected. A member of the
Stanford faculty will accompany each team of police officers as an
observer inside the building and other faculty members will be
stationed outside the building to observe events there. In view of
these precautions, and especially in view ol the added dangers
produced by large crowds of on lookers, we urgently request all
members of the community, except those who have been asked to
observe, to stay away from Encina Hall until the process is ended.
The decision we have taken is in itself testimony to the urgency
with which we view the situation that developed last night. Encina
Hall, a building which has no conceivable relationship to the issues
of policy now before the University, was entered with violence,
highly sensitive personnel and other internal University files were
being rifled, critical functions of the University were in grave
danger, but appeals to reason and the use of University disciplinary
procedures were not effective.
The blunt fact is that this University was faced with an
intolerable situation, and was forced in the last extremity to
choose this course of action. No university in the United States has
done more to make its internal governing processes work than has
Stanford. We do not despair that they can work in the future, but
we are convinced beyond doubt that they have failed to work in
this case. We ask the support and cooperation of the faculty,
students, and staff during this difficult period.
