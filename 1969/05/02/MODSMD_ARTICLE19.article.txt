# Police Stand By
## The 						Last Hour In Encina 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The flat gray light of dawn was
shining through the windows of
Encina Hall when they heard it.
"The cops are coming!"
Worn, sjeepless faces tightened
with excitement and fear; Fred
Cohen grabbed a bullhorn and
raced throughout the building,
summoning the sparse contingent
of April 3rd Movement
demonstrators to an emergency
meeting on the second floor.
"It's true, the cops are on their
way," said an administrator who
apeared suddenly in the hallway.
"Tell people they can get out
before they arrive."
Disbelief, stubborn disbelief
that outside police finally came to
Stanford, swelled up and then
shattered as the students realized
that the administration couldn't
do without this key building, even
for one day.
At fi:4s a.m., 100 nervous
demonstrators clustered in the
Controllers office. Michael Wald, a
youthful law professor, climbed
on a desk and told them, "The
decision has already been made to
use police. They will arrive in 15
minutes."
Rapid Movement
The room erupted into
murmurs and rapid movement.
Wald explained that a faculty
member would accompany each
group of policemen, who would
first order a student to leave

before arresting him. Professors
Sandy Dornbusch, Don Kennedy,
and Jim Gibbons looked on
silently.
Larry Chrisliani mounted a
desk to chair the meeting. "We
have only a few minutes to decide
what we're going to do. I'm going
to mostly ignore Robert's Rules."
Despite the pressure, the rump
session of demonstrators
conducted the meeting in the
parliamentary style that has
become a trademark of the
Movement. Motions where made
to leave or stay, amendments were
offered, points of order sprang up.
At first al! the debate called for
leaving immediately to avoid
arrest. But gradually a calm
returned, and more and more
speakers talked of staying to show
their commitment by submitting
to arrest. There was talk of how
jail is an important experience,
and how the trials could become
political education.
At 7:00 Dan DeYoung, the
University public safety officer,
interrupted the meeting with a
bullhorn and ordered the students
to leave. A Santa Clara cop then
ordered the students to disperse
"in the name of the people of the
State of California." Jeers of
"Pig" and "Free Huey" drowned
out the ultimatums.
Suddenly a shout rose, "Here
they come!" Two huge buses
pulled up in front of Encina and

discharged more than 100
riot-equipped police. The meeting
became more frantic, but stayed
in order.
At 7:12, with police streaming
into the downstairs lobby, the
students voted by a narrow
margin to leave and regroup
outside.
Police Rush
Suddenly the police started a
rush up the stairway, ready to
seize the demonstrators. A faculty
member shouted "Stop! They
voted to leave." The police
paused.
Wyman Clears Door
Bill Wyman, associate dean of
students, nervously asked a clump
of Santa Clara deputies to clear
the doorway so the demonstrators
could leave. "We agreed to let
them go out by themselves, didn't
we?" said Wyman to no one in
particular.
A slow stream of
demonstrators, male and female,
strolled out the front door,
nonchalantly eyeing a mass of
helmeted San Jose police in front.
A girl poked her head out a
third-story window. "Power to
the people," she screamed. "Free
Huey."
At 7:25 a large red flag draped
over the doorway was pulled away
by a lingering demonstrator onthe
second story.
The six-hour sit-in was over. It
was May Day.
