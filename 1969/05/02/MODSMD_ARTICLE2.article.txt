# Lyman's Statement

### 
Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.

to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that
the invocation of the President's
emergency powers to place students on
immediate temporary suspension might
produce more result in the course of
today than it did last night.
Before proceeding to give our answer
to that very legitimate question, I
should remark that we did invoke those
emergency powers, and did make every
effort to make them effective last night.
When it had become clear, out of that
protracted, bitter and repellant
argument within the April 3rd
Movement yesterday afternoon and
evening, which I assume many of you
heard, at least in part, over
KZSU—when it had become clear that a
firm decision had been taken by them
to occupy another building, we began
calling upon faculty members to come
to the President's Office and accompany
the Dean of Students and the Associate
Dean of Students in attempting to carry
out the steps, suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council in its statement of
April 17th, steps necessary to bring the
emergency powers into action.
And at this point let me underline
the obvious: The faculty who rallied to
that call and spent the entire night, first
working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The
job they undertook was not only
extremely repellant to most faculty; it
was also potentially dangerous. They
deserve the thanks of everyone who
cares about Stanford, certainly
including all who may disagree with any
or all of the steps undertaken last night
with the cooperation of these faculty
volunteers. There's been a lot of loose
talk about people putting their bodies
on the line. I know a group of
distinguished and honorable Stanford
faculty who showed their willingness to
put their bodies, and a lot more besides,

on a most difficult line last night, and I
salute them. The same must be said, and
with heart felt emphasis about the
members of the Faculty Consultative
Group.
The faculty members who had come
to the President's Office accompanied
Joel Smith and Bill Wyman to Encina,
first to fulfill the requirements for
determining that there was indeed a
breach of the President's emergency
regulations involved in the sit-in; second
to give proper warning to those involved
that such a violation had been
determined; and third to help identify
as many as possible of those who were
persisting in that violation. At the
notice of immediate summary
temporary suspension, some occupants
of Encina vacated the building. But
most remained, and the rifling through
files that had characterized the
occupation from its inception
continued.
In a very real sense, the University's
on-campus remedies, designed to end a
disruption, were then exhausted. We
could have waited to see whether the
actual delivery of letters addressed to
individual students, informing them of
their suspension, might have made some
difference; actual suspension, even
temporarily, from this University has,
after all, been so infrequent an
occurrance, especially arising out of a
disruption, that there was some reason
to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps

Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that

working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The
job they undertook was not only
extremely repellant to most faculty; it
was also potentially dangerous. They
deserve the thanks of everyone who
cares about Stanford, certainly
including all who may disagree with any
or all of the steps undertaken last night
with the cooperation of these faculty
volunteers. There's been a lot of loose
talk about people putting their bodies
on the line. I know a group of
distinguished and honorable Stanford
faculty who showed their willingness to
put their bodies, and a lot more besides,

on a most difficult line last night, and I
salute them. The same must be said, and
with heart felt emphasis about the
members of the Faculty Consultative
Group.
The faculty members who had come
to the President's Office accompanied
Joel Smith and Bill Wyman to Encina,
first to fulfill the requirements for
determining that there was indeed a
breach of the President's emergency
regulations involved in the sit-in; second
to give proper warning to those involved
that such a violation had been
determined; and third to help identify
as many as possible of those who were
persisting in that violation. At the
notice of immediate summary
temporary suspension, some occupants
of Encina vacated the building. But
most remained, and the rifling through
files that had characterized the
occupation from its inception
continued.
In a very real sense, the University's
on-campus remedies, designed to end a
disruption, were then exhausted. We
could have waited to see whether the
actual delivery of letters addressed to
individual students, informing them of
their suspension, might have made some
difference; actual suspension, even
temporarily, from this University has,
after all, been so infrequent an
occurrance, especially arising out of a
disruption, that there was some reason
to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that
the invocation of the President's
emergency powers to place students on
immediate temporary suspension might
produce more result in the course of
today than it did last night.
Before proceeding to give our answer
to that very legitimate question, I
should remark that we did invoke those
emergency powers, and did make every
effort to make them effective last night.
When it had become clear, out of that
protracted, bitter and repellant
argument within the April 3rd
Movement yesterday afternoon and
evening, which I assume many of you
heard, at least in part, over
KZSU—when it had become clear that a
firm decision had been taken by them
to occupy another building, we began
calling upon faculty members to come
to the President's Office and accompany
the Dean of Students and the Associate
Dean of Students in attempting to carry
out the steps, suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council in its statement of
April 17th, steps necessary to bring the
emergency powers into action.
And at this point let me underline
the obvious: The faculty who rallied to
that call and spent the entire night, first
working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The

downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that
the invocation of the President's
emergency powers to place students on
immediate temporary suspension might
produce more result in the course of
today than it did last night.
Before proceeding to give our answer
to that very legitimate question, I
should remark that we did invoke those
emergency powers, and did make every
effort to make them effective last night.
When it had become clear, out of that
protracted, bitter and repellant
argument within the April 3rd
Movement yesterday afternoon and
evening, which I assume many of you
heard, at least in part, over
KZSU—when it had become clear that a
firm decision had been taken by them
to occupy another building, we began
calling upon faculty members to come
to the President's Office and accompany
the Dean of Students and the Associate
Dean of Students in attempting to carry
out the steps, suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council in its statement of
April 17th, steps necessary to bring the
emergency powers into action.
And at this point let me underline
the obvious: The faculty who rallied to
that call and spent the entire night, first
working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The
job they undertook was not only
extremely repellant to most faculty; it
was also potentially dangerous. They
deserve the thanks of everyone who
cares about Stanford, certainly
including all who may disagree with any
or all of the steps undertaken last night
with the cooperation of these faculty
volunteers. There's been a lot of loose
talk about people putting their bodies
on the line. I know a group of
distinguished and honorable Stanford
faculty who showed their willingness to
put their bodies, and a lot more besides,

on a most difficult line last night, and I
salute them. The same must be said, and
with heart felt emphasis about the
members of the Faculty Consultative
Group.
The faculty members who had come
to the President's Office accompanied
Joel Smith and Bill Wyman to Encina,
first to fulfill the requirements for
determining that there was indeed a
breach of the President's emergency
regulations involved in the sit-in; second
to give proper warning to those involved
that such a violation had been
determined; and third to help identify
as many as possible of those who were
persisting in that violation. At the
notice of immediate summary
temporary suspension, some occupants
of Encina vacated the building. But
most remained, and the rifling through
files that had characterized the
occupation from its inception
continued.
In a very real sense, the University's
on-campus remedies, designed to end a
disruption, were then exhausted. We
could have waited to see whether the
actual delivery of letters addressed to
individual students, informing them of
their suspension, might have made some
difference; actual suspension, even
temporarily, from this University has,
after all, been so infrequent an
occurrance, especially arising out of a
disruption, that there was some reason
to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think

campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that
the invocation of the President's
emergency powers to place students on
immediate temporary suspension might
produce more result in the course of
today than it did last night.
Before proceeding to give our answer
to that very legitimate question, I
should remark that we did invoke those
emergency powers, and did make every
effort to make them effective last night.
When it had become clear, out of that
protracted, bitter and repellant
argument within the April 3rd
Movement yesterday afternoon and
evening, which I assume many of you
heard, at least in part, over
KZSU—when it had become clear that a
firm decision had been taken by them
to occupy another building, we began
calling upon faculty members to come
to the President's Office and accompany
the Dean of Students and the Associate
Dean of Students in attempting to carry
out the steps, suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council in its statement of
April 17th, steps necessary to bring the
emergency powers into action.
And at this point let me underline
the obvious: The faculty who rallied to
that call and spent the entire night, first
working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The
job they undertook was not only
extremely repellant to most faculty; it
was also potentially dangerous. They
deserve the thanks of everyone who
cares about Stanford, certainly
including all who may disagree with any
or all of the steps undertaken last night
with the cooperation of these faculty
volunteers. There's been a lot of loose
talk about people putting their bodies
on the line. I know a group of
distinguished and honorable Stanford
faculty who showed their willingness to
put their bodies, and a lot more besides,

on a most difficult line last night, and I
salute them. The same must be said, and
with heart felt emphasis about the
members of the Faculty Consultative
Group.
The faculty members who had come
to the President's Office accompanied
Joel Smith and Bill Wyman to Encina,
first to fulfill the requirements for
determining that there was indeed a
breach of the President's emergency
regulations involved in the sit-in; second
to give proper warning to those involved
that such a violation had been
determined; and third to help identify
as many as possible of those who were
persisting in that violation. At the
notice of immediate summary
temporary suspension, some occupants
of Encina vacated the building. But
most remained, and the rifling through
files that had characterized the
occupation from its inception
continued.
In a very real sense, the University's
on-campus remedies, designed to end a
disruption, were then exhausted. We
could have waited to see whether the
actual delivery of letters addressed to
individual students, informing them of
their suspension, might have made some
difference; actual suspension, even
temporarily, from this University has,
after all, been so infrequent an
occurrance, especially arising out of a
disruption, that there was some reason
to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been

imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that
the invocation of the President's
emergency powers to place students on
immediate temporary suspension might
produce more result in the course of
today than it did last night.
Before proceeding to give our answer
to that very legitimate question, I
should remark that we did invoke those
emergency powers, and did make every
effort to make them effective last night.
When it had become clear, out of that
protracted, bitter and repellant
argument within the April 3rd
Movement yesterday afternoon and
evening, which I assume many of you
heard, at least in part, over
KZSU—when it had become clear that a
firm decision had been taken by them
to occupy another building, we began
calling upon faculty members to come
to the President's Office and accompany
the Dean of Students and the Associate
Dean of Students in attempting to carry
out the steps, suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council in its statement of
April 17th, steps necessary to bring the
emergency powers into action.
And at this point let me underline
the obvious: The faculty who rallied to
that call and spent the entire night, first
working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The
job they undertook was not only
extremely repellant to most faculty; it
was also potentially dangerous. They
deserve the thanks of everyone who
cares about Stanford, certainly
including all who may disagree with any
or all of the steps undertaken last night
with the cooperation of these faculty
volunteers. There's been a lot of loose
talk about people putting their bodies
on the line. I know a group of
distinguished and honorable Stanford
faculty who showed their willingness to
put their bodies, and a lot more besides,

on a most difficult line last night, and I
salute them. The same must be said, and
with heart felt emphasis about the
members of the Faculty Consultative
Group.
The faculty members who had come
to the President's Office accompanied
Joel Smith and Bill Wyman to Encina,
first to fulfill the requirements for
determining that there was indeed a
breach of the President's emergency
regulations involved in the sit-in; second
to give proper warning to those involved
that such a violation had been
determined; and third to help identify
as many as possible of those who were
persisting in that violation. At the
notice of immediate summary
temporary suspension, some occupants
of Encina vacated the building. But
most remained, and the rifling through
files that had characterized the
occupation from its inception
continued.
In a very real sense, the University's
on-campus remedies, designed to end a
disruption, were then exhausted. We
could have waited to see whether the
actual delivery of letters addressed to
individual students, informing them of
their suspension, might have made some
difference; actual suspension, even
temporarily, from this University has,
after all, been so infrequent an
occurrance, especially arising out of a
disruption, that there was some reason
to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order

necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out
then, rather than waiting a day, perhaps
invoking the in-some-ways-preferable
instrument of a civil restraining order,
and meanwhile continuing to hope that
the invocation of the President's
emergency powers to place students on
immediate temporary suspension might
produce more result in the course of
today than it did last night.
Before proceeding to give our answer
to that very legitimate question, I
should remark that we did invoke those
emergency powers, and did make every
effort to make them effective last night.
When it had become clear, out of that
protracted, bitter and repellant
argument within the April 3rd
Movement yesterday afternoon and
evening, which I assume many of you
heard, at least in part, over
KZSU—when it had become clear that a
firm decision had been taken by them
to occupy another building, we began
calling upon faculty members to come
to the President's Office and accompany
the Dean of Students and the Associate
Dean of Students in attempting to carry
out the steps, suggested by the Stanford
Judicial Council in its statement of
April 17th, steps necessary to bring the
emergency powers into action.
And at this point let me underline
the obvious: The faculty who rallied to
that call and spent the entire night, first
working to effectuate the emergency
powers, then working to do everything
possible to assure success in the use of
police, those faculty demonstrated the
highest form of unselfish devotion to
the University and its preservation. The
job they undertook was not only
extremely repellant to most faculty; it
was also potentially dangerous. They
deserve the thanks of everyone who
cares about Stanford, certainly
including all who may disagree with any
or all of the steps undertaken last night
with the cooperation of these faculty
volunteers. There's been a lot of loose
talk about people putting their bodies
on the line. I know a group of
distinguished and honorable Stanford
faculty who showed their willingness to
put their bodies, and a lot more besides,

on a most difficult line last night, and I
salute them. The same must be said, and
with heart felt emphasis about the
members of the Faculty Consultative
Group.
The faculty members who had come
to the President's Office accompanied
Joel Smith and Bill Wyman to Encina,
first to fulfill the requirements for
determining that there was indeed a
breach of the President's emergency
regulations involved in the sit-in; second
to give proper warning to those involved
that such a violation had been
determined; and third to help identify
as many as possible of those who were
persisting in that violation. At the
notice of immediate summary
temporary suspension, some occupants
of Encina vacated the building. But
most remained, and the rifling through
files that had characterized the
occupation from its inception
continued.
In a very real sense, the University's
on-campus remedies, designed to end a
disruption, were then exhausted. We
could have waited to see whether the
actual delivery of letters addressed to
individual students, informing them of
their suspension, might have made some
difference; actual suspension, even
temporarily, from this University has,
after all, been so infrequent an
occurrance, especially arising out of a
disruption, that there was some reason
to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
Why, then, last night? Why did we
conclude, not only that there was a
necessity to call int the police, but that
that necessity was pressing and
immediate, that it must be carried out

to think that few would believe it until
they actually experienced it in person.
A3M Contempt, Violence
That possibility, along with every
other conceivable reason to refrain from
calling in police, was canvassed in the
Faculty Consultative Group during its
intensive exploration of this matter
between about 2:30 a.m. and 4 a.m.
today. I return to my question: why did
not these various and weighty
considerations cause us to reach some
other decision than one we in fact
reached?
First, the difference between being
told you're suspended and receiving a
letter to that effect seemed to us at best
marginal. The violaters' utter contempt
for the entire institution of on-campus
judicial due process had, after all, been
demonstrated not only last night but
throughout the sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Laboratory the week before

last. Indeed, few aspects of our current
crisis are clearer or more critically
significant than this contempt. We have
tried —President Pitzer has tried, the
Judicial Countil has tried, you have
tried—to the utmost of your ability to
make the on-campus procedures work.
The careful labors of faculty and
students in creating the Stanford
Judicial and Legislative Charters last
year has been dismissed by the SDS and
by many, if not most, members of the
April 3rd Coalition, as a hopeless, if not
downright silly exercise in liberal
self-delusion, aimed at suppressing
dissent rather than achieving justice. At
least tacit acceptance of that view, in
the form of unwillingness to assist in
making that machinery work, had been
more widespread than I like to think
and it has contributed its bit to the
decision taken this morning to call upon
the civil power for the purpose of
supplementing the on-campus judicial
and enforcement measures. This
Council, by its approval of the
Statement on Community
Responsibility a few weeks ago,
recognized that the alternatives available
to us are stark and few: make the
campus system work, or call in outside
elements to restore a tolerable degree of
peace to the campus.
A second reason why we decided to
call upon the Sheriff's office was the
character of the Encina occupation.
From the outset it was violent, students
who attempted to stand in the
doorways and peaceably block the entry
of demonstrators were roughly shoved
aside and in some cases manhandled.
Locked doors, both on the exterior of
the building and, later, inside were
broken open; so were windows. Once
inside, the demonstrators opened desks
and files in many parts of the building,
and were seen seizing documents from
those files. Given the fact that Encina
contains not one but a wide variety of
sensitive and important repositories of
information, this was highly ominous.
In the Planning Office, soon broken into
and occupied, is kept information on
the routes of sewers, steam lines, power
lines and the like, without which we
might well spend an interesting if
unprofitable decade or so conducting
amateur archeological expeditions in an
attempt to rediscover where these things

are. In the Payroll Office is information
the nature and significance of which I
need not pause to describe. The very
machinery for paying all University
employees is in jeopardy when Encina
Hall is occupied by hostile and
unpredictible forces. Serious disruption
of the General Secretary's Office would
imperil the means by which a private
university sustains itself through gifts—a
crassly materialistic matter one may say,
but crucial to our capacity to function
as a University. And so on.
The point was made last night that it
was conceivable that the most serious
damage had already been done in
Encina, and that calling police was to
that extent dubious as being too late.
Against that was the reported fact that
exploitation of files, and acts of
vandalism, had been more random than
systematic, and the reasonable
expectation that continuation of the
seizure through today would imply a
more systematic effort. Also, such
sensitive areas as the inner portion of
the General Secretary's office, and the
Administrative Date Processing
computers, were as yet unoccupied
(through three attempts were made to
enter the former, each being repelled by
a firm warning that such occupation
would mean immediate police action.
These warnings were delivered in person
by George Gregory, a member of Mr.
Cuthbertson's staff, at my specific
direction only some hours before the
police were called—in fact, before the
target was definitely determined to be
Encina.
Continuing risk to vital information
and vital University functions was a
strong consideration, then.
Lii.keu with that was the fact, of
which we have been aware since we first
discussed possible police action on the
campus a year ago, that the Sheriff's
office can best act in the early shours of
the morning. The presence of large
crowds, including many not directly
involved in he demonstration, has been
a potent cause of confusion in other
campus police actions around the
country. Such confusion contributes to
the likelihood of personal injury. It
cannot be contemplated lightly.
I should also make clear that the
intention of the police, and of ourselves
in asking for their help, was to clear the

building, not to accumulate victims of
arrest. To insure that we were as well
prepared to obtain this result as
possible, we have had numerous
conversations with Sheriff Prelsnik and
his people over the past twelve months.
Their understanding of campus
problems, and of the sensitivity to
police action that exists on campus, has
always been of the utmost help to us.
Their cooperation in our plans to
involve faculty as observers going along
with arrest teams, and as general
observers, is something for which we're
also most grateful. Like most of us,
policemen would rather operate on their
own terms and in their own established
fashion. The Sheriff of Santa Clara
County has understood and accepted
the need for limitations on this
autonomy of action.
A further reason for our decision lay
in the fact that the Encina Occupation
comes so rapidly upon the heels of the
AEL sit-in. At some point, nearly every
member of this Council will agree,
defenses must be invoked against
wanton, indiscriminate and arbitrary
actions designed to force University
acquiescence in the views of any campus
group, no matter how high-minded. It is
not a matter of patience being
exhausted; it is a matter of sheer
credibility. No institution, not even a
University, can continue indefinitely
working in an atmosphere of coercion,
indeed with the fact of coercive
interruption daily demonstrated.
Substantial numbers of University
people, from distinguished members of
this body to employees in many
branches of the University srevice
functions—and most certainly including
students—have complained that without
effective deterrence to disruptive forces,
life at Stanford would soon become
intolerable, and the University's
essential functions would cease to be
performed, or their performance would
be damaged so severely as to threaten
our capacity to consider ourselves an
effective institution.
On the other hand, an effective
effort to curb such forces would restore
credibility in Stanford's determination
and capacity to run its affairs.
I could continue with further
analysis of the complex and probing
discussions and reasoning that led to our

decision this morning, but I shall not.
The Faculty Consultative Group was
unanimous in its conclusion that this
course of action was not only justified
but necessary. Dean Smith, though
understandably reluctant to abandon
the hope that the on-campus judicial
machinery might work to produce an
evacuation of the building, supported
the decision, and brought to the
discussion preceding it those qualities of
lucidity and breadth of judgment for
which, amongst other things, he will be
so badly missed when he leaves Stanford
at the end of this year.
One further word, if I may. No one is
entitled to consider clearing of Encina
Hall a victory. Any time it becomes
necessary for a University to summon
the police, a defeat has taken place. I'm
reminded of Winston Churchill's
declaration after Dunkerque, when too
many of his fellow countrymen
imagined that Hitler was on the
downward path: "Wars are not won by
successful evacuations."
The victory we seek at Stanford is
not like a military victory; it is a victory
of reason and the examined life over
unreason and the tyranny of coercion.
To be forced into coercive acts in order
to meet coercive acts is in itself a
set back on the path that leads to our
kind of victory.
But surrender does not produce
victory either, whether in war or in the
personal struggle that each and everyone
of us carries on from the cradle to the
grave. The French say "Reculer pour
mieux sauter"—draw back to jump
better. Maybe that is what we have
done. It is not going to be easy to
jump—or even to creep —forward in the
conditions facing universities today. A
brutal and senseless war abroad; brutal
and senseless oppression at home; a
feeling of desperation among the young
at their powerlessness of remedy these
things—those conditions limit our
chances for success. I believe in
Universities, and I believe in Stanford. I
have done my best to serve those
beliefs. It is no disgrace, and no cause
for chagrin if one's best in such times as
these is not good enough. I thank you
for listening, and I wish us all well as we
labor to reconstruct the mutual
confidence without which no human
enterprise can succeed.
