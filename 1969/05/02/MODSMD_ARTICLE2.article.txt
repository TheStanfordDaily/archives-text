# Lyman's Statement

Provost Lyman's remarks:
I hope that the Council will forgive
me for any lack of rhetorical verve that
may derive from my having been up all
night.
It occurred to me as I was
considering what needed saying this
afternoon that a good many Deans,
Provosts and Presidents have gone
through something resembling this
experience over the past few years. To
cite a particularly melancholy example
from the very recent past, my longtime
friend and fellow historian and
distinguished scholar and Dean of the
Faculty of Arts and Sciences at Harvard,
Franklin Ford, went through it. His
remarks made the New York Times.
They did not, apparently, persuade the
Harvard Faculty. I shall be happy to
forego the former state of felicity if I
can also escape the latter result.
Police Summoned Reluctantly
I hope—l profoundly hope—that the
Council will recognize the deep
reluctance with which I, in full

consultation with the President's
Faculty Consultative Group, took the
decision at 4 a.m. today to summon the
forces at the disposal of the Sheriff of
Santa Clara County to the campus for
the purpose of clearing Encina Hall,
which had been occupied by members
of the April 3rd Movement since 1 a.m.
There are probably rumors—there
usually are in such situations— to the
effect that I have been yearning for the
opportunity to do something more or
less like this for some time, perhaps
ever since last May. It is perhaps a
mistake to dignify such rumors with a
denial, but that is a risk I believe I must
take. At no time, until I picked up the
telephone in my office at 4 this morning
to call the President at his home and
report the recommendation
unanimously reached by the Faculty
Consultative Group, the Dean of
Students, the Associate Provost, and
myself, did I urge or recommend that
police be called to Stanford.
