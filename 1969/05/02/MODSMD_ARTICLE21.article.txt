# Editor's Critique
## Press Ideology Sick 
### 
American newspaperdom is
financially healthy but
ideologically sick, Norman Isaacs,
executive editor of the Louisville
Courier-Journal and Times said
Wednesday night.
Isaacs, here to deliver the
annual Carlos McClatchy
Memorial Lecture, said that
television has outstripped the
printed media in immediacy and
truthful coverage.
The only things a newspaper
can do, he exphasized is "to go
beyond television's purview—to go
where the camera does not take
you—to explain the 'why."
Quoting James Reston's brutal
dictum, "The American
newspaperman would rather break
a story than understand it," Isaacs
told 150 guests in Bishop
Auditorium of the Graduate
School of Business: "We have to
educate reporters out of their wild
drives to get stories in print.
Significant Stories
"Let us miss an edition, or two
editions, if we must. But let's get
into print stories that are correct,
and complete and significant.
"This inflexibility about
coverage—the need for blinding
speed, the need to be covered
about everything, is absurd. It is
an anachronism in today's life."
Isaacs, president-elect of the
American Soceity of Newspaper
Editors and long known as one of
the gadflies of the profession,
warned:
"Curing ourselves of these
habit-fixations —the trite language,
the thoughtless addiction to
speed, the acceptance of copy and
merely hunting missing commas

rather than probing for clarity and
understanding, the judging of
news by rote —is vital if
newspapering is to live up to its
challenges over the next two
decades."
'Square Rebel'
Classing himself as a "square
rebel" avid for reform of society's
inequities but a devotee of the
orderly processes of democracy,
Isaacs scored the newspaper
hierarchy's fierce resentment of
criticism from within or without.
"I am as offended by the
excesses in the general American
culture as an Abbie Hoffman, as
disgusted by the shabby racism so
widely prevalent as a Stokely
Carmichael, as bitter about the
Vietnam war as any draft-card
burner, as critical of the
backwardness of so many
educational institutions as any
SDS leader, as contemptuous of
the Far Right's Birch-type
neanderthal mouthings as any
Yippee."
The Kentucky newspaper
executive told the gathering that
needed change "must stop short
of blind, unthinking violence."
Public Survey
He quoted a Roper Research
survey made just a month ago that
revealed the most recent public
attitudes toward the news media.
These figures show, he said,
that "59 percent (of the public)
prefer TV for news of national
and world affairs compared to 49
percent for newspapers; 25
percent for radio and only 7
percent for magazines.
"The reason this adds up to

well over 100 percent is that the
researchers accepted multiple
answers," he explained.
"For newspapermen, the most
disturbing figure should be the
one which shows that the public
rates TV as the most believable
news medium—leading newspapers
two to one," Isaacs said.
'Sick Giant'
"Newspapering is a sick
giant—desperately in need of a
double transplant—new brain, new
heart."
He blasted the entire American
society for its "arrogance of
power in Washington, the state
capitals, the city halls. The
arrogance of manufacturers,
suppliers, service people. Like the
bubonic plague, it's catching."
And in newspaperdom, he
pointed out, "we have the
arrogance of shrugging off
complaints and protests about
inaccuracies and slanted
coverage . . .the arrogance of
printing hurtful half-and
quarter-truths on Page One and
relegating weasel-worded
corrections to Pages 31, 41, or 51.
Arrogance
"And worst, the arrogance of
assuming to ourselves the right to
criticize everything and everyone
in the world, but refusing to
permit the slightest criticism of
newspaper journalism."
He cited the mass negative
response by the industry to his
special committee's search for the
truth concerning charges of the
"one-party" press, which, he
charged, the industry prejudged
and denied before "even waiting
to receive the proposals."

challenges over the next two
decades."
'Square Rebel'
Classing himself as a "square
rebel" avid for reform of society's
inequities but a devotee of the
orderly processes of democracy,
Isaacs scored the newspaper
hierarchy's fierce resentment of
criticism from within or without.
"I am as offended by the
excesses in the general American
culture as an Abbie Hoffman, as
disgusted by the shabby racism so
widely prevalent as a Stokely
Carmichael, as bitter about the
Vietnam war as any draft-card
burner, as critical of the
backwardness of so many
educational institutions as any
SDS leader, as contemptuous of
the Far Right's Birch-type
neanderthal mouthings as any
Yippee."
The Kentucky newspaper
executive told the gathering that
needed change "must stop short
of blind, unthinking violence."
Public Survey
He quoted a Roper Research
survey made just a month ago that
revealed the most recent public
attitudes toward the news media.
These figures show, he said,
that "59 percent (of the public)
prefer TV for news of national
and world affairs compared to 49
percent for newspapers; 25
percent for radio and only 7
percent for magazines.
"The reason this adds up to

well over 100 percent is that the
researchers accepted multiple
answers," he explained.
"For newspapermen, the most
disturbing figure should be the
one which shows that the public
rates TV as the most believable
news medium—leading newspapers
two to one," Isaacs said.
'Sick Giant'
"Newspapering is a sick
giant—desperately in need of a
double transplant—new brain, new
heart."
He blasted the entire American
society for its "arrogance of
power in Washington, the state
capitals, the city halls. The
arrogance of manufacturers,
suppliers, service people. Like the
bubonic plague, it's catching."
And in newspaperdom, he
pointed out, "we have the
arrogance of shrugging off
complaints and protests about
inaccuracies and slanted
coverage . . .the arrogance of
printing hurtful half-and
quarter-truths on Page One and
relegating weasel-worded
corrections to Pages 31, 41, or 51.
Arrogance
"And worst, the arrogance of
assuming to ourselves the right to
criticize everything and everyone
in the world, but refusing to
permit the slightest criticism of
newspaper journalism."
He cited the mass negative
response by the industry to his
special committee's search for the
truth concerning charges of the
"one-party" press, which, he
charged, the industry prejudged
and denied before "even waiting
to receive the proposals."
American newspaperdom is
financially healthy but
ideologically sick, Norman Isaacs,
executive editor of the Louisville
Courier-Journal and Times said
Wednesday night.
Isaacs, here to deliver the
annual Carlos McClatchy
Memorial Lecture, said that
television has outstripped the
printed media in immediacy and
truthful coverage.
The only things a newspaper
can do, he exphasized is "to go
beyond television's purview—to go
where the camera does not take
you—to explain the 'why."
Quoting James Reston's brutal
dictum, "The American
newspaperman would rather break
a story than understand it," Isaacs
told 150 guests in Bishop
Auditorium of the Graduate
School of Business: "We have to
educate reporters out of their wild
drives to get stories in print.
Significant Stories
"Let us miss an edition, or two
editions, if we must. But let's get
into print stories that are correct,
and complete and significant.
"This inflexibility about
coverage—the need for blinding
speed, the need to be covered
about everything, is absurd. It is
an anachronism in today's life."
Isaacs, president-elect of the
American Soceity of Newspaper
Editors and long known as one of
the gadflies of the profession,
warned:
"Curing ourselves of these
habit-fixations —the trite language,
the thoughtless addiction to
speed, the acceptance of copy and
merely hunting missing commas

rather than probing for clarity and
understanding, the judging of
news by rote —is vital if
newspapering is to live up to its
challenges over the next two
decades."
