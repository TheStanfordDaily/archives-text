# Campuses Erupt Across Nation

Students walked out of
buildings they were occupying at
Columbia University yesterday
after an arrest warrant was signed.
"We haven't won the support
we should have," said Michael
Golash, a leader of the Students
for a Democratic Society at
Columbia. "Most of us, I think,
were prepared to be arrested."
About 200 SDS radicals and
supporters, mostly white, walked
out of the Mathematics Building
and Fayerweather Hall after
warrants for their arrest were
issued in New York State
Supreme Court. They occupied
the buildings Wednesday, in a
demand for greater Negro
enrollment in Columbia's
20,000-member student body.
Legal action also was launched
in an effort to force a reopening
of City College in New York,
closed for more than a week by
Negro and Puerto Rican
demonstrators. And at the
University of Rochester in
up-state New York, a two-day
class boycott was called off for
lack of student support.
Senate to Investigate
As disorder and protest
flickered on campuses across the
nation, Sen. John L. McClellan,
D-Ark., said in Washington his
permanent Senate Investigation
subcommittee will launch an
investigation of student rebellion,
probably in about a month.
"All I can say now," he told a
reporter, "is that we are going to
make a pretty thorough
investigation."
Also in Washington, the Justice

Department's No. 2 official,
Deputy Atty. Gen. Richard C.
Kleindienst, called for prompt
prosecution of persons who lead
or provoke violent campus
demonstrations. In a Law Day
address at the Pentagon, he spoke
of "the ideological criminal on
our campuses."
Disorders at Queens
At Queens College in New
York, about 15 Negro students
overturned tables and threw chairs
through windows in the faculty
cafeteria, then invaded the school
library where they turned over
bookcases, ripped out telephones
and scattered card files.
At Queens, with an enrollment
of 2 5,000, several hundred
radicals have held the
administration building since
Monday, demanding amnesty for
38 students and a professor
arrested in an earlier
demonstration.
About 20 other students staged
a counter sit-in, urging that police
be called to clear the building.
Evening classes were suspended at
the school.
A sit-in continued at
Q ueensborough Community
College in New York City over the
school's refusal to rehire an
English professor, fired, the
demonstrators claim, for left-wing
activity.
More Protests
In calling off the classroom
boycott at the University of
Rochester, its leaders admitted
they received little student
support. They demand that the
university sever connections with
the military establishment. About
8,500 students are enrolled.
Helmeted police evicted 21
Negro students an hour after they
locked themselves in a dean's
office at the University of
Louisville,. and officials said the
group would be charged with
disorderly conduct. It was the
second such demonstration in as
many days at the 5,600-student
school.
A threat to call in campus
police ended a sit-in by six of
Indiana State University's 12,000
students. They were protesting
tuition increases and demanding
expulsion of a dean.
At Indiana University, the FBI
said it was investigating an
aborted attempt to fire bomb a
structure hut used by the Reserve
Officers Training Corps. There
was little damage.
Purdue and Rider
About 100 Purdue University
demonstrators camped in a
Student Union lounge to protest
tuition increases for the school's
35,000 students.
On the lighter side, a measure
of sexual integration was won at
Rider College in Lawrenceville,
N.J., after 700 of its 3,500
students boycotted classes and
seized the gymnasium building.
