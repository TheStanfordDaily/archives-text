# Thousands Chant 'Free Huey'
## 
### 
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-As an
estimated 4,500 demonstrators
chanted "Free Huey Newton"
outside the Federal Building, a
U.S. district judge today took
under submission the bail plea of
the convicted Black Panther
leader.
Judge Alfonso Zirpoli's ruling
is not expected before next week
because he granted Herbert O.
Reid, Howard University law "
professor, permission to file a
friend of the court brief.
Asst. Atty. Gen. Albert W.
Harris then asked for two days to
reply to the Reid's brief.
The courtroom was well filled
and quiet with about 40 percent
of the onlookers Negro.
Outside, the predominately
Negro crowd marched around the
building and gathered in the plaza,
bearing placards which had a
picture of Newton superimposed
on a red star.
Attorneys Fay Stender and
Charles R. Gary argued that trial
judge Monroe J. Friedman applied
racially discriminatory standards
in denying Newton's freedom on
bail during his appeal from
conviction of voluntary
manslaughter in the killing of an
Oakland policeman.
Friedman had said he acted on
the basis of Newton's prior
criminal record and concluded his
freedom would be a menace to
the community.
Mrs. Stender argued that on
the contrary Newton would be a

force for peace and quiet in the
Negro community.
Harris said the real issue was
Huey Newton's record—a "record
of repeated violence against not
only police officers but other
black persons."
Zirpoli commented to the
defense attorneys that he had not
been able to find a single case
where a federal court had released

on bail during appeal a prisoner
convicted of a felony in a state
court.
After the hearing Garry told
the crowd outside: "The state of
California says Huey Newton is a
danger to the community. What
do you say?"
The crowd replied: "Freedom,
freedom, freedom for Huey."
