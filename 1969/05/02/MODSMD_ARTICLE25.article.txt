## Promoters Dictate 'In' Rock 
### PETER THOMPSON 
Now that rock has become Art and a
Success and Big Business (and not necessarily
in that order), there's a lot more mire to wade
through. I mean, all those high prices and
promotional build-ups, and your friendly FM
stations dictating all the FaarOout things we
should like, and . . .forget it.
A grand alternative like Traffic or the
Charlatans appears and promptly gets
strangled. And the Avalon got busted. The
Avalon: a sanctuary of bliss and sanity, like
the old Carousel, Larry Miller and Edward
Bear on KMPX, impromptu park concerts,
and Paul Williams in Craw daddy! ... all just
too nice to last. Change is okay, but only if
you move from the change. A terrifying
amount of rock is currently solidified,
forgetful of why it's there and permissive
about allowing someone else to determine
where it's going.
I hope they don't take the Fillmore from
Bill Graham—l like to see all those people
too—but maybe it's inevitable. I have a friend
who thinks it would provide us with the
necessary purge, and he's probably right. The
mysto that once made it all so perfect is hard
to find these days; nobody listens or dances or
feels anymore. Nothing is special. Michael
Bloomfield used to say it'd all end in flash and
style and show biz; Ken Kesey just said,
"They'll know where it is but not what it is."
Amen.
Creedence Clearwater
With all this in mind, I heartily encourage
you to avoid music like Creedence Clearwater
Revival. I know they're competent, but so are
several hundred other bands. I know they're
tight and clean, but that doesn't always mean
good music. I know they're loud, but so
what? Their "live" performances are mere
re-creations of thosy draggy songs and boring
leads of John Fogerty on their albums; a real

treat for the lip-synch fans. A couple of nice
singles, but sorry: the"newwave" this ain't.
And a group with the talents of Cream
should know better than to release an album
like "Goodbye." It is an insult to the audience
and presumably embarrassing to the band.
Clapton's song, "Badge," (with Geo. Harrison
on rhythm) and some of his solos save the set
from being a complete disaster, but I sure
hope Skip James never listens to what they've
done to his "I'm So Glad." Virtuosity is just
fine, but only if you can find a reason for it.
Some local concerts by highly-regarded
people have also been disappointing. Led
Zepplin should have been great. Ex-Yardbird
Jimmy Page is an electrically brilliant guitarist
and bassist John Paul Jones and drummer
John Bonham fit in ideally. But most of their
impact vanishes when vocalist Robert Plant
opens his mouth. Shades of the Jeff Beck
group. Groups with so much musical potential
really should remember that somebody has to
sing.
INew Area Bands
Most of the newly-successful bands
emerging from the Bay Area (A.B. Skye,
Country Weather, Aum, Frumious
Bandersnatch) feature a whiz-band guitarist
with energetic support, and purport to be
playing blues. Well, maybe, but none for me,
thanks. The wonderful thing about many of
the groups who've come out of S.F. is that
they've made their own music; primarily
blues, yes, but not necessarily in gravelly
voices or twelve bars.
"Comin' Back to You" or "Bass Strings"
have a whole lot more to do with blues than
any old extended imitation of a 8.8. King
standard. Man, everyone's heard 8.8. do them
himself, and they were beautiful because of
his talents and because they were his. Which
doesn't mean that people shouldn't play other
people's music. But if your new rendition

doesn't have something of you in it, I don't
see where you've given us much.
My aforementioned friend thinks it
inconceivable that kids now say they like
blues but won't listen to Roland Kirk or
Richard Farina records. A non sequitur,
indeed. Just like those calling Eric Calpton the
world's greatest guitarist and then refusing to
listen to Jerry Hahn or Doc Watson or Kenny
Burrell. Some airing is clearly in order. Beware
of anything called "heavy."
All this is not to say that the Old Masters
are flawless. For example, the new version of
Muddy Waters' band played here recently and,
from their hour-long set, it was virtually
impossible to recognize that Muddy is
probably the single most influential person in
the development of rock.
No one is left from those exciting days of a
few years ago and Muddy has been forced into
playing the electro-sigh-ka-dill-eech crap that
filled his "Electric Mud" album. The band just
kept shuckin', occasionally losing the beat, but
knowing they'd be adored regardless. Muddy
played some very tired bottleneck, his new
harpist contributed exactly nothing, and I
wanted to cry. Muddy would have never put
up with this nonsense back when.
But enough of this. Surprises still keep
coming. Success certainly spoiled Moby Grape
and John Mayall, but both have performed
well recently. For those worried about the
passing of Chicago blues, Magic Sam presents
testimony to the contrary.
I know it'll keep getting better . . .if it
doesn't suffocate first. Rock has made me
understand why Pauline Kael feels as she does
about the movies. Don't follow leaders. There
must be some way out of here.
P.S. There may be: Chet Helmes and the
Family Dog will be back in business in June,
emphasizing the "party" (as well as the
musical) elements of dance-concerts.

have a whole lot more to do with blues than
any old extended imitation of a 8.8. King
standard. Man, everyone's heard 8.8. do them
himself, and they were beautiful because of
his talents and because they were his. Which
doesn't mean that people shouldn't play other
people's music. But if your new rendition

doesn't have something of you in it, I don't
see where you've given us much.
My aforementioned friend thinks it
inconceivable that kids now say they like
blues but won't listen to Roland Kirk or
Richard Farina records. A non sequitur,
indeed. Just like those calling Eric Calpton the
world's greatest guitarist and then refusing to
listen to Jerry Hahn or Doc Watson or Kenny
Burrell. Some airing is clearly in order. Beware
of anything called "heavy."
All this is not to say that the Old Masters
are flawless. For example, the new version of
Muddy Waters' band played here recently and,
from their hour-long set, it was virtually
impossible to recognize that Muddy is
probably the single most influential person in
the development of rock.
No one is left from those exciting days of a
few years ago and Muddy has been forced into
playing the electro-sigh-ka-dill-eech crap that
filled his "Electric Mud" album. The band just
kept shuckin', occasionally losing the beat, but
knowing they'd be adored regardless. Muddy
played some very tired bottleneck, his new
harpist contributed exactly nothing, and I
wanted to cry. Muddy would have never put
up with this nonsense back when.
But enough of this. Surprises still keep
coming. Success certainly spoiled Moby Grape
and John Mayall, but both have performed
well recently. For those worried about the
passing of Chicago blues, Magic Sam presents
testimony to the contrary.
I know it'll keep getting better . . .if it
doesn't suffocate first. Rock has made me
understand why Pauline Kael feels as she does
about the movies. Don't follow leaders. There
must be some way out of here.
P.S. There may be: Chet Helmes and the
Family Dog will be back in business in June,
emphasizing the "party" (as well as the
musical) elements of dance-concerts.
Now that rock has become Art and a
Success and Big Business (and not necessarily
in that order), there's a lot more mire to wade
through. I mean, all those high prices and
promotional build-ups, and your friendly FM
stations dictating all the FaarOout things we
should like, and . . .forget it.
A grand alternative like Traffic or the
Charlatans appears and promptly gets
strangled. And the Avalon got busted. The
Avalon: a sanctuary of bliss and sanity, like
the old Carousel, Larry Miller and Edward
Bear on KMPX, impromptu park concerts,
and Paul Williams in Craw daddy! ... all just
too nice to last. Change is okay, but only if
you move from the change. A terrifying
amount of rock is currently solidified,
forgetful of why it's there and permissive
about allowing someone else to determine
where it's going.
I hope they don't take the Fillmore from
Bill Graham—l like to see all those people
too—but maybe it's inevitable. I have a friend
who thinks it would provide us with the
necessary purge, and he's probably right. The
mysto that once made it all so perfect is hard
to find these days; nobody listens or dances or
feels anymore. Nothing is special. Michael
Bloomfield used to say it'd all end in flash and
style and show biz; Ken Kesey just said,
"They'll know where it is but not what it is."
Amen.
Creedence Clearwater
With all this in mind, I heartily encourage
you to avoid music like Creedence Clearwater
Revival. I know they're competent, but so are
several hundred other bands. I know they're
tight and clean, but that doesn't always mean
good music. I know they're loud, but so
what? Their "live" performances are mere
re-creations of thosy draggy songs and boring
leads of John Fogerty on their albums; a real

treat for the lip-synch fans. A couple of nice
singles, but sorry: the"newwave" this ain't.
And a group with the talents of Cream
should know better than to release an album
like "Goodbye." It is an insult to the audience
and presumably embarrassing to the band.
Clapton's song, "Badge," (with Geo. Harrison
on rhythm) and some of his solos save the set
from being a complete disaster, but I sure
hope Skip James never listens to what they've
done to his "I'm So Glad." Virtuosity is just
fine, but only if you can find a reason for it.
Some local concerts by highly-regarded
people have also been disappointing. Led
Zepplin should have been great. Ex-Yardbird
Jimmy Page is an electrically brilliant guitarist
and bassist John Paul Jones and drummer
John Bonham fit in ideally. But most of their
impact vanishes when vocalist Robert Plant
opens his mouth. Shades of the Jeff Beck
group. Groups with so much musical potential
really should remember that somebody has to
sing.
INew Area Bands
Most of the newly-successful bands
emerging from the Bay Area (A.B. Skye,
Country Weather, Aum, Frumious
Bandersnatch) feature a whiz-band guitarist
with energetic support, and purport to be
playing blues. Well, maybe, but none for me,
thanks. The wonderful thing about many of
the groups who've come out of S.F. is that
they've made their own music; primarily
blues, yes, but not necessarily in gravelly
voices or twelve bars.

Bloomfield used to say it'd all end in flash and
style and show biz; Ken Kesey just said,
"They'll know where it is but not what it is."
Amen.
Creedence Clearwater
With all this in mind, I heartily encourage
you to avoid music like Creedence Clearwater
Revival. I know they're competent, but so are
several hundred other bands. I know they're
tight and clean, but that doesn't always mean
good music. I know they're loud, but so
what? Their "live" performances are mere
re-creations of thosy draggy songs and boring
leads of John Fogerty on their albums; a real

treat for the lip-synch fans. A couple of nice
singles, but sorry: the"newwave" this ain't.
And a group with the talents of Cream
should know better than to release an album
like "Goodbye." It is an insult to the audience
and presumably embarrassing to the band.
Clapton's song, "Badge," (with Geo. Harrison
on rhythm) and some of his solos save the set
from being a complete disaster, but I sure
hope Skip James never listens to what they've
done to his "I'm So Glad." Virtuosity is just
fine, but only if you can find a reason for it.
Some local concerts by highly-regarded
people have also been disappointing. Led
Zepplin should have been great. Ex-Yardbird
Jimmy Page is an electrically brilliant guitarist
and bassist John Paul Jones and drummer
John Bonham fit in ideally. But most of their
impact vanishes when vocalist Robert Plant
opens his mouth. Shades of the Jeff Beck
group. Groups with so much musical potential
really should remember that somebody has to
sing.
INew Area Bands
Most of the newly-successful bands
emerging from the Bay Area (A.B. Skye,
Country Weather, Aum, Frumious
Bandersnatch) feature a whiz-band guitarist
with energetic support, and purport to be
playing blues. Well, maybe, but none for me,
thanks. The wonderful thing about many of
the groups who've come out of S.F. is that
they've made their own music; primarily
blues, yes, but not necessarily in gravelly
voices or twelve bars.
"Comin' Back to You" or "Bass Strings"
have a whole lot more to do with blues than
any old extended imitation of a 8.8. King
standard. Man, everyone's heard 8.8. do them
himself, and they were beautiful because of
his talents and because they were his. Which
doesn't mean that people shouldn't play other
people's music. But if your new rendition

doesn't have something of you in it, I don't
see where you've given us much.
My aforementioned friend thinks it
inconceivable that kids now say they like
blues but won't listen to Roland Kirk or
Richard Farina records. A non sequitur,
indeed. Just like those calling Eric Calpton the
world's greatest guitarist and then refusing to
listen to Jerry Hahn or Doc Watson or Kenny
Burrell. Some airing is clearly in order. Beware
of anything called "heavy."
All this is not to say that the Old Masters
are flawless. For example, the new version of
Muddy Waters' band played here recently and,
from their hour-long set, it was virtually
impossible to recognize that Muddy is
probably the single most influential person in
the development of rock.
No one is left from those exciting days of a
few years ago and Muddy has been forced into
playing the electro-sigh-ka-dill-eech crap that
filled his "Electric Mud" album. The band just
kept shuckin', occasionally losing the beat, but
knowing they'd be adored regardless. Muddy
played some very tired bottleneck, his new
harpist contributed exactly nothing, and I
wanted to cry. Muddy would have never put
up with this nonsense back when.
But enough of this. Surprises still keep
coming. Success certainly spoiled Moby Grape
and John Mayall, but both have performed
well recently. For those worried about the
passing of Chicago blues, Magic Sam presents
testimony to the contrary.
I know it'll keep getting better . . .if it
doesn't suffocate first. Rock has made me
understand why Pauline Kael feels as she does
about the movies. Don't follow leaders. There
must be some way out of here.
P.S. There may be: Chet Helmes and the
Family Dog will be back in business in June,
emphasizing the "party" (as well as the
musical) elements of dance-concerts.
Now that rock has become Art and a
Success and Big Business (and not necessarily
in that order), there's a lot more mire to wade
through. I mean, all those high prices and
promotional build-ups, and your friendly FM
stations dictating all the FaarOout things we
should like, and . . .forget it.
A grand alternative like Traffic or the
Charlatans appears and promptly gets
strangled. And the Avalon got busted. The
Avalon: a sanctuary of bliss and sanity, like
the old Carousel, Larry Miller and Edward
Bear on KMPX, impromptu park concerts,
and Paul Williams in Craw daddy! ... all just
too nice to last. Change is okay, but only if
you move from the change. A terrifying
amount of rock is currently solidified,
forgetful of why it's there and permissive
about allowing someone else to determine
where it's going.
I hope they don't take the Fillmore from
Bill Graham—l like to see all those people
too—but maybe it's inevitable. I have a friend
who thinks it would provide us with the
necessary purge, and he's probably right. The
mysto that once made it all so perfect is hard
to find these days; nobody listens or dances or
feels anymore. Nothing is special. Michael
Bloomfield used to say it'd all end in flash and
style and show biz; Ken Kesey just said,
"They'll know where it is but not what it is."
