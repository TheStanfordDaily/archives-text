# DAMAGE

### 
Although no official estimate is yet
available, damage done to Encina Hall
during yesterday's sit-in probably runs
to "more than $1,000" according to
one source. Most of this was due to the
five windows broken and the damaged
front door. No files were damaged,
although a few, both open and closed
files, on second and fourth floors were
looked at. On first and third floors, no
files were touched by demonstrators.
A total of two typewriters were
damaged, and one $400 typewriter was
stolen. Several offices mentioned that
parts of their typewriters were missing.
There were reports of personal
property—"mean things, little yak,
petty cash"—having been taken.
A notice reading: "this department
kosher, only insipid work done here"
was given credit by one office on fourth
floor for having saved them from any
tampering. Mrs. Buma, accounting
manager, comptrollers office,
emphasized that she appreciated the
care taken by the demonstrators, but
nevertheless felt quite "sad" that
unnecessary and destructive things had
happened. The basement of Encina
evidently was not entered and had no
damage done to it.
