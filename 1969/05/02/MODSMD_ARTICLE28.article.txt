# Trustees Hear Testimony On SRI
## 
### 
Proposals that Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) should be sold for the
maximum possible value, that it be
dissolved, and that it be redirected
toward entirely civilian goals were
voiced in separate statements by three
faculty members before the Trustees
Wednesday afternoon.
Yesterday's Daily carried a summary
of Law Prof. Kenneth E. Scott's
position that his study committee faced
no other possible decision but to sell
SRI.
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), suggested that a summer-long
study should lead either to "a clearly
feasible plan for constructive dedication
of SRI to civilian goals . . . (or) to
separation from the University."
Dissolve SRI
Prof. Robert B. Textor of education
and anthropology presented " 'a'
possible solution that might be worth
considering if other proposals fail to

secure agreement among the
constituencies concerned . . ."
He suggested that SRI should be
dissolved over a one or two year period,
following immediate cancellation of
"morally objectionable" contracts.
Textor was quick to point out that
the move was a "last ditch" proposal,
which he, in fact, was currently
"disendorsing." But he added that such
a move "would demonstrate that this
University will no longer lend its name,
prestige, and moral authority to secret
research, to research of questionable
morality, to research sometimes of
questionable quality, or, most
importantly, to research highly likely to
lead to the death of large numbers of
innocent people in the Third World."
Students had other suggestions. Two
agreed that further study was needed.
Michael Kuhl, recently elected
president of the California College
Young Republicans, blasted both the
Scott report on SRI and the

student-faculty report on ROTC.
The April Third Movement has
demonstrated its ability to confront
individuals, he added, but has not
tackled the issues of academic freedom
and individual integrity with equal
vigor.
"For the second time this year, an
important issue has been tossed out in a
report, as if there were a
publish-or-perish syndrome here. We've
rushed off looking for simplistic
solutions, without consulting with
people directly affected."
David Jones, graduate student in
communication and head of the
Committee for New Politics, said that
"freedom is freedom only for those who
are able to use it . . . Freedom is a moot
point without the power to realize it
and the research grants to fund it.
Constructive research is a moot point
without the hope that our national
priorities can be rearranged to allow its
implementation."

Jones added that "as a nation, we
have presumed to determine the
economic, political and cultural future
of nations other than our own. Too
often, this cultural egotism has been
backed with the force of arms."
He suggested that the Scott
committee report be reformulated,
taking into account the opinion of the
SRI staff, "the feasibility of a specific
restrictive covenant," the costs,
benefits, and likelihood of a sale with
restrictive covenants, and a full
disclosure of all projects at SRI.
Jones asked that no decision on SRI
be made until the new report is issued,
and that, in the meantime, the
moratorium on new CBW contracts now
in effect at SRI be extended to
counterinsurgency work.
Finally, he suggested that a meeting
of the entire community be held to
decide on the issue, and that its decision
be approved pro forma by the Board.

innocent people in the Third World."
Students had other suggestions. Two
agreed that further study was needed.
Michael Kuhl, recently elected
president of the California College
Young Republicans, blasted both the
Scott report on SRI and the

student-faculty report on ROTC.
The April Third Movement has
demonstrated its ability to confront
individuals, he added, but has not
tackled the issues of academic freedom
and individual integrity with equal
vigor.
"For the second time this year, an
important issue has been tossed out in a
report, as if there were a
publish-or-perish syndrome here. We've
rushed off looking for simplistic
solutions, without consulting with
people directly affected."
David Jones, graduate student in
communication and head of the
Committee for New Politics, said that
"freedom is freedom only for those who
are able to use it . . . Freedom is a moot
point without the power to realize it
and the research grants to fund it.
Constructive research is a moot point
without the hope that our national
priorities can be rearranged to allow its
implementation."

Jones added that "as a nation, we
have presumed to determine the
economic, political and cultural future
of nations other than our own. Too
often, this cultural egotism has been
backed with the force of arms."
He suggested that the Scott
committee report be reformulated,
taking into account the opinion of the
SRI staff, "the feasibility of a specific
restrictive covenant," the costs,
benefits, and likelihood of a sale with
restrictive covenants, and a full
disclosure of all projects at SRI.
Jones asked that no decision on SRI
be made until the new report is issued,
and that, in the meantime, the
moratorium on new CBW contracts now
in effect at SRI be extended to
counterinsurgency work.
Finally, he suggested that a meeting
of the entire community be held to
decide on the issue, and that its decision
be approved pro forma by the Board.
Proposals that Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) should be sold for the
maximum possible value, that it be
dissolved, and that it be redirected
toward entirely civilian goals were
voiced in separate statements by three
faculty members before the Trustees
Wednesday afternoon.
Yesterday's Daily carried a summary
of Law Prof. Kenneth E. Scott's
position that his study committee faced
no other possible decision but to sell
SRI.
Prof. Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center
(SLAC), suggested that a summer-long
study should lead either to "a clearly
feasible plan for constructive dedication
of SRI to civilian goals . . . (or) to
separation from the University."
Dissolve SRI
Prof. Robert B. Textor of education
and anthropology presented " 'a'
possible solution that might be worth
considering if other proposals fail to

secure agreement among the
constituencies concerned . . ."
He suggested that SRI should be
dissolved over a one or two year period,
following immediate cancellation of
"morally objectionable" contracts.
Textor was quick to point out that
the move was a "last ditch" proposal,
which he, in fact, was currently
"disendorsing." But he added that such
a move "would demonstrate that this
University will no longer lend its name,
prestige, and moral authority to secret
research, to research of questionable
morality, to research sometimes of
questionable quality, or, most
importantly, to research highly likely to
lead to the death of large numbers of
innocent people in the Third World."
