# Council Action
## Faculty OK's Police Use 
### 
The Academic Council yesterday
approved a resolution supporting the
action taken by President Kenneth
Pitzer, Provost Richard Lyman, and the
Faculty Advisory CommiLtee to end the
occupation of Encina Hall.
The resolution, passed with only
scattered dissent, followed addresses to
the body by both Pitzer and Lyman.
The Council meeting replaced a
scheduled meeting of the Academic
Senate to disucss the University's
relation to SRI. That meeting has been
rescheduled for 3:15 this afternoon.
The failure of the student occupants
of Encina Hall to respond to the
internal judicial process which had been
set in motion and the destructive tone

of the sit-in itself were cited by Pitzer as
making necessary the use of Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies to clear the
building.
Suspensions Explained
Pitzer explained to the Council that
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed have been implemented.
He also told the assembled faculty
members that the administration was in
the process of seeking an injunction to
restrain both outsiders and suspended
students from persisting in destructive
acts or in violating the terms of their
suspensions.
Although he expressed the hope that
no one would be arrested, Pitzer
asserted that willful violation of the
injunction would result in arrests being
made on campus.
Before asking Lyman to describe to
the Council his experiences and views of
the occupation, Pitzer called upon
faculty, staff, and students "to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels."
Only in this manner, Pitzer concluded,
can Stanford avoid a major catastrophe
in the days ahead.
Fuller Account Given
Lyman gave a fuller account of the
considerations and events which had led
him and the five available members of
the Faculty Consultative Group on
Campus Disorders to summon the Santa
Clara County Sheriff.
He explained that it has become
obvious that the suspensions were being
ignored by the students who remained
in Encina because of contempt for the
campus judicial processes. They were
not serving to disperse the building's
occupants.
Lyman declared that there was

evidence that files of great importance
to the University had been manhandled
and that his group decided that vital
university functions would have been
hindered if the building were not
cleared.
Moreover, he asserted that the
University is determined to end the use
of coercion on campus and to deter
disruptive forces from prohibiting the
University to run its affairs.
Lyman concluded that by
summoning the police, Stanford had
suffered a defeat. "The victory that we
seek is a victory of reason and the
examined life over unreason and the
tyranny of coercion."

scattered dissent, followed addresses to
the body by both Pitzer and Lyman.
The Council meeting replaced a
scheduled meeting of the Academic
Senate to disucss the University's
relation to SRI. That meeting has been
rescheduled for 3:15 this afternoon.
The failure of the student occupants
of Encina Hall to respond to the
internal judicial process which had been
set in motion and the destructive tone

of the sit-in itself were cited by Pitzer as
making necessary the use of Santa Clara
County Sheriff's deputies to clear the
building.
Suspensions Explained
Pitzer explained to the Council that
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed have been implemented.
He also told the assembled faculty
members that the administration was in
the process of seeking an injunction to
restrain both outsiders and suspended
students from persisting in destructive
acts or in violating the terms of their
suspensions.
Although he expressed the hope that
no one would be arrested, Pitzer
asserted that willful violation of the
injunction would result in arrests being
made on campus.
Before asking Lyman to describe to
the Council his experiences and views of
the occupation, Pitzer called upon
faculty, staff, and students "to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels."
Only in this manner, Pitzer concluded,
can Stanford avoid a major catastrophe
in the days ahead.
Fuller Account Given
Lyman gave a fuller account of the
considerations and events which had led
him and the five available members of
the Faculty Consultative Group on
Campus Disorders to summon the Santa
Clara County Sheriff.
He explained that it has become
obvious that the suspensions were being
ignored by the students who remained
in Encina because of contempt for the
campus judicial processes. They were
not serving to disperse the building's
occupants.
Lyman declared that there was

evidence that files of great importance
to the University had been manhandled
and that his group decided that vital
university functions would have been
hindered if the building were not
cleared.
Moreover, he asserted that the
University is determined to end the use
of coercion on campus and to deter
disruptive forces from prohibiting the
University to run its affairs.
Lyman concluded that by
summoning the police, Stanford had
suffered a defeat. "The victory that we
seek is a victory of reason and the
examined life over unreason and the
tyranny of coercion."
The Academic Council yesterday
approved a resolution supporting the
action taken by President Kenneth
Pitzer, Provost Richard Lyman, and the
Faculty Advisory CommiLtee to end the
occupation of Encina Hall.
The resolution, passed with only
scattered dissent, followed addresses to
the body by both Pitzer and Lyman.
