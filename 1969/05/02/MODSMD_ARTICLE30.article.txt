# Cal Nine Here
## 
### 
Right hander Phil Keller will be
on the mount for the Indians
tomorrow as the Tribe battles Cal
for a piece of the Pacific-8
baseball lead. The game starts at
8:15 in Sunken Diamond.
This afternoon Stanford hosts
the San Diego Marine ball club in
a 3:00 game. Coach Ray Young
will probably pitch sophomores
Bruce Schoen and Bob Marshall.
Yesterday Jim Coate was
scheduled to pitch against USl' in
San Francisco.
The busy weekend of baseball
began for the Tribe - with a
Wednesday win over Cal State at
Hayward. Soph Steve Dunning
gave up eight hits as the Indians
won, 4-2. The game, played on a
windy and cold afternoon at

Hayward, was highlighted by a
towering home run by right
fielder Don Schellenberg, Dick
Borchers' three hits, and a
three-run homer in the first by
Bob Boone which was called foul
by the only man on the field who
counted—the home plate umpire.
Boone's right arm, bruised in last
Friday's game against USC, didn't
hurt his effectiveness at third
base.
Going into tomorrow's action,
four teams, Stanford, Cal, UCLA,
and USC are tied for the Pac-8
lead with 8-4 records. And Oregon
and Oregon State, with 6-6 marks,
aren't out of the race either. Cal
will go with Tom McAlone, who
leads the league with an 0.28
ERA.
