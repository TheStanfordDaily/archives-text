# Track Toss Up

"Tomorrow's meet with Cal is
the type I'd love to watch as a
spectator, but not as a coach,
said Stanford's mentor Payton
Jordan. The Big Meet starts
tomorrow at 1:15 p.m. in the
tanford Stadium.
But if the Tribe reaches its
peak, Coach Jordan may enjoy
the afternoon after all since the
Indians rate a good chance of
upsetting the Bears.
On the track, Cal sends their
sprint strength against the hurdle
and distance power of Stanford,
while in the field the teams are
virtually even. In order to combat
Berkeley's superior depth, Jordan
will ask demanding doubles ol
Allen Sanford and Duncan
McDonald in the mile and two ,
mile, and Randy White in the 440
and 440 intermediate hurdles.
Doubling in the Big Meet is not
new to Sanford who successfully
turned the trick as a sophomore.
Then last year he stuck to the
mile, winning easily in 4:08.0.
Now he has a shot at becoming
the first athlete ever to win three
consecutive Big Meet Miles.
Ironically his biggest race of
the day will come an hour and a
half later when he and McDonald
try to knock off Cal two mile ace
Bob Waldon.
In between, White will have
attempted to avert a Bear sweep
in the quarter mile and then will
return to face a gutty Bob
McLennan in the intermediates.
Sophomore running mate Rick
Tipton is also in line for a
yeoman's day—leading off the
sprint relay, running in the high
hurdles, and coming back in the
100. A third sophomore with a
pressure packed race is flashy Pete
Fairchild (1:50.9) who will
Itempt to turn back the
challenge of Jerry Tallon (1:50.7)
in what could be a blazing hall
mile.
But some of the keenest

competition of the day will take
place on the infield where high
jumper Clarence "Tree" Johnson
tries to duplicate last year's
victory over Indian captain Peter
Boyce and where Gary
Pennington tries to do the same in
the javelin against undefeated
Tom Colby.
Both the shot with T. C. Jones
and the discus with Steve Davis
are must-events for the Tribe, but
both face stiff competition from
Cal's musclemen.
The only sure events for
Stanford appear to be the
steeplechase with undefeated
Brook Thomas, the highs with
Tipton and the mile with Sanford,
McDonald, and Bob Anchondo.

Fairchild (1:50.9) who will
Itempt to turn back the
challenge of Jerry Tallon (1:50.7)
in what could be a blazing hall
mile.
But some of the keenest

competition of the day will take
place on the infield where high
jumper Clarence "Tree" Johnson
tries to duplicate last year's
victory over Indian captain Peter
Boyce and where Gary
Pennington tries to do the same in
the javelin against undefeated
Tom Colby.
Both the shot with T. C. Jones
and the discus with Steve Davis
are must-events for the Tribe, but
both face stiff competition from
Cal's musclemen.
The only sure events for
Stanford appear to be the
steeplechase with undefeated
Brook Thomas, the highs with
Tipton and the mile with Sanford,
McDonald, and Bob Anchondo.
"Tomorrow's meet with Cal is
the type I'd love to watch as a
spectator, but not as a coach,
said Stanford's mentor Payton
Jordan. The Big Meet starts
tomorrow at 1:15 p.m. in the
tanford Stadium.
But if the Tribe reaches its
peak, Coach Jordan may enjoy
the afternoon after all since the
Indians rate a good chance of
upsetting the Bears.
On the track, Cal sends their
sprint strength against the hurdle
and distance power of Stanford,
while in the field the teams are
virtually even. In order to combat
Berkeley's superior depth, Jordan
will ask demanding doubles ol
Allen Sanford and Duncan
McDonald in the mile and two ,
mile, and Randy White in the 440
and 440 intermediate hurdles.
Doubling in the Big Meet is not
new to Sanford who successfully
turned the trick as a sophomore.
Then last year he stuck to the
mile, winning easily in 4:08.0.
Now he has a shot at becoming
the first athlete ever to win three
consecutive Big Meet Miles.
Ironically his biggest race of
the day will come an hour and a
half later when he and McDonald
try to knock off Cal two mile ace
Bob Waldon.
In between, White will have
attempted to avert a Bear sweep
in the quarter mile and then will
return to face a gutty Bob
McLennan in the intermediates.
Sophomore running mate Rick
Tipton is also in line for a
yeoman's day—leading off the
sprint relay, running in the high
hurdles, and coming back in the
100. A third sophomore with a
pressure packed race is flashy Pete
