# Showdown
## Lacrosse Challenge 
### 
The Big Game in western
lacrosse is shaping up for Sunday
when Stanford meets the Air
Force Academy in Colorado
Springs. Before that, though, the
Indians will have to meet a tough
University of Denver team on
Saturday.
Stanford and Air Force have
identical 6-0 records. The Falcons
have scored over 100 goals to
Stanford's 74, but the Air Force
defense has allowed 23 goalsâ€”the
Tribe only 9.
The defending champion Cards
have won 27 games in a row.
Last year, on their home turf,
Stanford beat Air Force 8-4, and
was forced into double-overtime
against Denver before winning,
7-5.
The key to the Stanford game
last year was one of the nation's
best defensive units; half of that

unit left with the graduation of
crease defenseman Dennis
McNeeley and goalie Mel Ellis, but
the bruising outside defensemen
Bill Eakland and Wade Killefer are
back. Both rated All-New England
in prep school days, Killefer and
Eakland look to newcomers Doug
Patt and Ted McCracken Lo fill
the left by McNeeley. Goalie
play has been almost evenly
divided between Jay Morse, a
Baltimore product, and Dan
Clement, who prepped at Exeter.
In six games, Stanford has allowed
9 goals, but they have not been
severely tested yet.
If the defense is not quite as
solid as last year's, Coach George
Weiksner feels that the attack is
probably stronger. The Indians
have found a play maker in the
slight and shifty Chip Loveman to
complement the play of
Co-Captain George Muser.
