# Injunction Hits A3M, Rally Called For Noon
## 
### 
Stanford University yesterday
morning obtained an injunction and
temporary restraining order against 36
members of the April 3rd Movement
and up to five hundred, as yet unnamed
defendants. Thirty-three of the 36
defendants are expected to receive
notice from the University today of
their temporary suspension. The other
three defendants are non-students.
The injunction prohibits all
defendants from obstructing free use
and movement in and around any
academic, administrative or service
building of Stanford University. In
addition, those students suspended by
the University are prohibited from
entering the "principal" campus during
the term of their suspension other than
to attend hearings of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC).
The restraining order was issued in
Superior Court at the request of the
administration, and granted in the name

of the Board of Trustees, the legal
owners of Stanford University. The
court acted after reading "verified
complaint and the supporting
declarations" requesting a restraining
order. The court issued the order at
9:30 a.m. yesterday after hearing the
plaintiff's case. A complete text of the
order and the names of the defendants
appears on page four.
Injunction Revealed
The injunction against the students
was revealed last night at a meeting of
about 900 people of the April Third
Movement in Cubberley Auditorium.
The injunction emitted almost an
immediate response from the Movement
who later in the evening voted to
"demand that the Academic Senate
decide at their 3:15 meeting on Friday
to recommend that the Administration
withdraw the injunction order."
The defendants have been ordered to
appear in court at 9:30 a.m. on May 13.
Tliat is also the date of a scheduled
Board of Trustee's Meeting in San
Francisco. Any connection between the
two is uncertain.
Restraining Order
Persons violating the temporary
restraining order' are subject to arrest,
and if found guilty can be sentenced to
up to six months in the county jail.
A rally is scheduled for noon today
in White Plaza to discuss future plans. It
is expected that the topic of a student
boycott of classes will be discussed.
Just after the meeting began last
night Dan deYoung of the University
Department of Safety asked to be
recognized and read the injunction,
causing an immediate furor.
Political Differences
Up until that time an agenda
designed to mend political differences
among movement members following
Wednesday night's sit-in had been
approved and was just into its first point
of business.

among movement members following
Wednesday night's sit-in had been
approved and was just into its first point
of business.
The reading of the injunction
changed the entire structure of the
meeting.
After deYoung left Marc Heller was
served with an injunction inside the
building. It was discovered then that
four men carrying large manila

envelopes were serving papers just
outside the doors of the auditorium.
The men admitted to a Daily
reporter that they were carrying in the
neighborhood of 100 temporary
restraining orders. The papers were
served on a number of the individuals

listed specifically on a list as well as to a
select group of others who were not on
the list, but whom the observors said
they could identify.
The servers later indicated that they
were able to identify certain people
from photographs that had been
supplied to them.
Fred Cohen left the meeting and
reappeared soon after saying that he had
not been on the list but was served
under the "John Doe" provisions of the
papers.
Under this provision, if the server is
willing to identify in court the person
whom he serves, he can serve the paper
whether or not the person identifies
himself.
The four process servers left at 10:30
having served an undisclosed number of
injunctions.
During the meeting Marc Sapir,
stated that he had not been in Encina
Hall Wednesday night and yet was
served a restraining order.
University Attorney's
The firm of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown and Enersen is acting as
attorneys for the University. It was
pointed out at last night's meeting that
two members of the firm, Robert M.
Brown and Morris M. Doyle are
members of the Board of Trustees. It
was also noted that the firm's office in
San Francisco is in the same building as
the Trustee's office.
It was determined' then that
President Pitzer had made a brief
statement to the Academic Council
yesterday afternoon advising the faculty
of the order. But no action had been
taken in response to the move.
Paul Rupert, chairing the meeting,
read the statement which said in part,
"We are ... in the process of seeking an
injunction or a restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against those outsiders and
those suspended, if they persist in
destructive acts or violation of the terms
of their suspension. I hope that no one
will be arrested but if someone insists
on arrest by willful violation of the
injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have assembled again on this sort of
a subject this term and we are nearing
the limits of this sort of thing, it seems
to me, and the will of the community
needs to be expressed to those who
would disrupt the processes and
interfere with the rights of others in no
uncertain terms. I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved."

Rupert paraphrased the statement
saying "What he means is he's sorry to
screw us, but if we persist in being
screwed he will be happy to screw us. rt
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the Chapel
said that "the faculty knew nothing to
support the unilateral action of Trustees
outside of the University altogether. I
do think that it is fair to say that a great
number of faculty will be as indignant
about this as you are."
Napier made the statement before it
was realized that the administration had
issued the restraining order using the
Trustees name as plaintiff for legal
reasons.
Later at least one prof said that he
felt the faculty would not vote against
the administration's move.

Department of Safety asked to be
recognized and read the injunction,
causing an immediate furor.
Political Differences
Up until that time an agenda
designed to mend political differences
among movement members following
Wednesday night's sit-in had been
approved and was just into its first point
of business.
The reading of the injunction
changed the entire structure of the
meeting.
After deYoung left Marc Heller was
served with an injunction inside the
building. It was discovered then that
four men carrying large manila

envelopes were serving papers just
outside the doors of the auditorium.
The men admitted to a Daily
reporter that they were carrying in the
neighborhood of 100 temporary
restraining orders. The papers were
served on a number of the individuals

listed specifically on a list as well as to a
select group of others who were not on
the list, but whom the observors said
they could identify.
The servers later indicated that they
were able to identify certain people
from photographs that had been
supplied to them.
Fred Cohen left the meeting and
reappeared soon after saying that he had
not been on the list but was served
under the "John Doe" provisions of the
papers.
Under this provision, if the server is
willing to identify in court the person
whom he serves, he can serve the paper
whether or not the person identifies
himself.
The four process servers left at 10:30
having served an undisclosed number of
injunctions.
During the meeting Marc Sapir,
stated that he had not been in Encina
Hall Wednesday night and yet was
served a restraining order.
University Attorney's
The firm of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown and Enersen is acting as
attorneys for the University. It was
pointed out at last night's meeting that
two members of the firm, Robert M.
Brown and Morris M. Doyle are
members of the Board of Trustees. It
was also noted that the firm's office in
San Francisco is in the same building as
the Trustee's office.
It was determined' then that
President Pitzer had made a brief
statement to the Academic Council
yesterday afternoon advising the faculty
of the order. But no action had been
taken in response to the move.
Paul Rupert, chairing the meeting,
read the statement which said in part,
"We are ... in the process of seeking an
injunction or a restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against those outsiders and
those suspended, if they persist in
destructive acts or violation of the terms
of their suspension. I hope that no one
will be arrested but if someone insists
on arrest by willful violation of the
injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have assembled again on this sort of
a subject this term and we are nearing
the limits of this sort of thing, it seems
to me, and the will of the community
needs to be expressed to those who
would disrupt the processes and
interfere with the rights of others in no
uncertain terms. I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved."

Rupert paraphrased the statement
saying "What he means is he's sorry to
screw us, but if we persist in being
screwed he will be happy to screw us. rt
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the Chapel
said that "the faculty knew nothing to
support the unilateral action of Trustees
outside of the University altogether. I
do think that it is fair to say that a great
number of faculty will be as indignant
about this as you are."
Napier made the statement before it
was realized that the administration had
issued the restraining order using the
Trustees name as plaintiff for legal
reasons.
Later at least one prof said that he
felt the faculty would not vote against
the administration's move.
Stanford University yesterday
morning obtained an injunction and
temporary restraining order against 36
members of the April 3rd Movement
and up to five hundred, as yet unnamed
defendants. Thirty-three of the 36
defendants are expected to receive
notice from the University today of
their temporary suspension. The other
three defendants are non-students.
The injunction prohibits all
defendants from obstructing free use
and movement in and around any
academic, administrative or service
building of Stanford University. In
addition, those students suspended by
the University are prohibited from
entering the "principal" campus during
the term of their suspension other than
to attend hearings of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC).
The restraining order was issued in
Superior Court at the request of the
administration, and granted in the name

of the Board of Trustees, the legal
owners of Stanford University. The
court acted after reading "verified
complaint and the supporting
declarations" requesting a restraining
order. The court issued the order at
9:30 a.m. yesterday after hearing the
plaintiff's case. A complete text of the
order and the names of the defendants
appears on page four.
Injunction Revealed
The injunction against the students
was revealed last night at a meeting of
about 900 people of the April Third
Movement in Cubberley Auditorium.
The injunction emitted almost an
immediate response from the Movement
who later in the evening voted to
"demand that the Academic Senate
decide at their 3:15 meeting on Friday
to recommend that the Administration
withdraw the injunction order."
The defendants have been ordered to
appear in court at 9:30 a.m. on May 13.
Tliat is also the date of a scheduled
Board of Trustee's Meeting in San
Francisco. Any connection between the
two is uncertain.
Restraining Order
Persons violating the temporary
restraining order' are subject to arrest,
and if found guilty can be sentenced to
up to six months in the county jail.
A rally is scheduled for noon today
in White Plaza to discuss future plans. It
is expected that the topic of a student
boycott of classes will be discussed.

Paul Rupert, chairing the meeting,
read the statement which said in part,
"We are ... in the process of seeking an
injunction or a restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against those outsiders and
those suspended, if they persist in
destructive acts or violation of the terms
of their suspension. I hope that no one
will be arrested but if someone insists
on arrest by willful violation of the
injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have assembled again on this sort of
a subject this term and we are nearing
the limits of this sort of thing, it seems
to me, and the will of the community
needs to be expressed to those who
would disrupt the processes and
interfere with the rights of others in no
uncertain terms. I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved."

Rupert paraphrased the statement
saying "What he means is he's sorry to
screw us, but if we persist in being
screwed he will be happy to screw us. rt
B. Davie Napier, Dean of the Chapel
said that "the faculty knew nothing to
support the unilateral action of Trustees
outside of the University altogether. I
do think that it is fair to say that a great
number of faculty will be as indignant
about this as you are."
Napier made the statement before it
was realized that the administration had
issued the restraining order using the
Trustees name as plaintiff for legal
reasons.
Later at least one prof said that he
felt the faculty would not vote against
the administration's move.
Stanford University yesterday
morning obtained an injunction and
temporary restraining order against 36
members of the April 3rd Movement
and up to five hundred, as yet unnamed
defendants. Thirty-three of the 36
defendants are expected to receive
notice from the University today of
their temporary suspension. The other
three defendants are non-students.
The injunction prohibits all
defendants from obstructing free use
and movement in and around any
academic, administrative or service
building of Stanford University. In
addition, those students suspended by
the University are prohibited from
entering the "principal" campus during
the term of their suspension other than
to attend hearings of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC).
The restraining order was issued in
Superior Court at the request of the
administration, and granted in the name

of the Board of Trustees, the legal
owners of Stanford University. The
court acted after reading "verified
complaint and the supporting
declarations" requesting a restraining
order. The court issued the order at
9:30 a.m. yesterday after hearing the
plaintiff's case. A complete text of the
order and the names of the defendants
appears on page four.
Injunction Revealed
The injunction against the students
was revealed last night at a meeting of
about 900 people of the April Third
Movement in Cubberley Auditorium.
The injunction emitted almost an
immediate response from the Movement
who later in the evening voted to
"demand that the Academic Senate
decide at their 3:15 meeting on Friday
to recommend that the Administration
withdraw the injunction order."
The defendants have been ordered to
appear in court at 9:30 a.m. on May 13.
Tliat is also the date of a scheduled
Board of Trustee's Meeting in San
Francisco. Any connection between the
two is uncertain.
Restraining Order
Persons violating the temporary
restraining order' are subject to arrest,
and if found guilty can be sentenced to
up to six months in the county jail.
A rally is scheduled for noon today
in White Plaza to discuss future plans. It
is expected that the topic of a student
boycott of classes will be discussed.
Just after the meeting began last
night Dan deYoung of the University
Department of Safety asked to be
recognized and read the injunction,
causing an immediate furor.
Political Differences
Up until that time an agenda
designed to mend political differences
among movement members following
Wednesday night's sit-in had been
approved and was just into its first point
of business.
The reading of the injunction
changed the entire structure of the
meeting.
After deYoung left Marc Heller was
served with an injunction inside the
building. It was discovered then that
four men carrying large manila

envelopes were serving papers just
outside the doors of the auditorium.
The men admitted to a Daily
reporter that they were carrying in the
neighborhood of 100 temporary
restraining orders. The papers were
served on a number of the individuals

listed specifically on a list as well as to a
select group of others who were not on
the list, but whom the observors said
they could identify.
The servers later indicated that they
were able to identify certain people
from photographs that had been
supplied to them.
Fred Cohen left the meeting and
reappeared soon after saying that he had
not been on the list but was served
under the "John Doe" provisions of the
papers.
Under this provision, if the server is
willing to identify in court the person
whom he serves, he can serve the paper
whether or not the person identifies
himself.
The four process servers left at 10:30
having served an undisclosed number of
injunctions.
During the meeting Marc Sapir,
stated that he had not been in Encina
Hall Wednesday night and yet was
served a restraining order.
University Attorney's
The firm of McCutchen, Doyle,
Brown and Enersen is acting as
attorneys for the University. It was
pointed out at last night's meeting that
two members of the firm, Robert M.
Brown and Morris M. Doyle are
members of the Board of Trustees. It
was also noted that the firm's office in
San Francisco is in the same building as
the Trustee's office.
It was determined' then that
President Pitzer had made a brief
statement to the Academic Council
yesterday afternoon advising the faculty
of the order. But no action had been
taken in response to the move.
Paul Rupert, chairing the meeting,
read the statement which said in part,
