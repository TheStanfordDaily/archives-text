# Injunction Hits A3M, Rally Called For Noon
## 
### 
Stanford University yesterday
morning obtained an injunction and
temporary restraining order against 36
members of the April 3rd Movement
and up to five hundred, as yet unnamed
defendants. Thirty-three of the 36
defendants are expected to receive
notice from the University today of
their temporary suspension. The other
three defendants are non-students.
The injunction prohibits all
defendants from obstructing free use
and movement in and around any
academic, administrative or service
building of Stanford University. In
addition, those students suspended by
the University are prohibited from
entering the "principal" campus during
the term of their suspension other than
to attend hearings of the Stanford
Judicial Council (SJC).
The restraining order was issued in
Superior Court at the request of the
administration, and granted in the name

of the Board of Trustees, the legal
owners of Stanford University. The
court acted after reading "verified
complaint and the supporting
declarations" requesting a restraining
order. The court issued the order at
9:30 a.m. yesterday after hearing the
plaintiff's case. A complete text of the
order and the names of the defendants
appears on page four.
Injunction Revealed
The injunction against the students
was revealed last night at a meeting of
about 900 people of the April Third
Movement in Cubberley Auditorium.
The injunction emitted almost an
immediate response from the Movement
who later in the evening voted to
"demand that the Academic Senate
decide at their 3:15 meeting on Friday
to recommend that the Administration
withdraw the injunction order."
The defendants have been ordered to
appear in court at 9:30 a.m. on May 13.
Tliat is also the date of a scheduled
Board of Trustee's Meeting in San
Francisco. Any connection between the
two is uncertain.
Restraining Order
Persons violating the temporary
restraining order' are subject to arrest,
and if found guilty can be sentenced to
up to six months in the county jail.
A rally is scheduled for noon today
in White Plaza to discuss future plans. It
is expected that the topic of a student
boycott of classes will be discussed.
Just after the meeting began last
night Dan deYoung of the University
Department of Safety asked to be
recognized and read the injunction,
causing an immediate furor.
Political Differences
Up until that time an agenda
designed to mend political differences
among movement members following
Wednesday night's sit-in had been
approved and was just into its first point
of business.
