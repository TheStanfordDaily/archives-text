# Pitzer's Speech To Council
## 
### 
I would like to announce as before
that this is a meeting of the Academic
Council open to the regular members,
the Senior Members, Emeriti, and
invited guests, Dean Smith, Dean
Wyman, Dean Rosch, Dean Rosenzweig,
Mr. Beyers, Mrs. Coffey, the new ASSU
President, Pat Shea, and the most
recent—the recently retired President,
Denis Hayes. In inviting the Student
Association Presidents we are following
the action of the Senate which seemed
an appropriate precedent for this body
also.
I would also like to announce right at
the beginning, before getting into the
principal business, that the Senate
meeting displaced by this meeting of the
Academic Council this afternoon will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
in the usual place, and, as I understand
it, the agenda for tomorrow afternoon is
the single item of relations with SRI,
which has been the subject of extended
discussions already.
It is just short of two weeks since we

met in a special session of this body on
much the same subject. This meeting, as
before, concerns the capacity of the
campus to maintain conditions in which
teaching and research can effectively
take place. As I stated at that meeting,
and again in the letter of April 23 to
you, it was our intention to use all of
the machinery, the sanctions, the
methods, the persuasion of our internal
mechanism, including the suggestions of
the Judicial Council, and, in particular,
the immediate temporary suspension of
students in case of another Sit-In. Such
a Sit-In did occur last night in Encina
Hall, and these sanctions were applied
promptly. Unfortunately, the students
in Encina—at least most of them—did
not respond to either the advice and
persuasion of student leaders and of
faculty who visited the Hall or to the
persuasion of these sanctions. Also I am
sorry to say that the tone of this
episode was much more destructive than
that at the AEL. I will ask Dr. Lyman
and other firsthand observers to report

to you on this presently, but the broken
doors, the rifled files, the damaged
typewriters, were all evidence to me this
morning. Actually, I made a quick trip
to Los Angeles last night—yesterday
afternoon—to address the dinner of the
Stanford Associates. The last word that
I had received during the evening
indicated that a Sit-In was not likely.
Nevertheless, it seemed wise to return to
Stanford, but I retired and slept on the
assumption that there was no difficulty.
Actually then I was called at 4:00 a.m.
and received a report the equivalent of
which, I am sure, will be given to you
by Dr. Lyman in a few moments, and it
convinced me that he was entirely
correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, and I authorized
him to do so at once. The five available
members of the faculty Consultative
Group on Campus Disorders
unanimously recommended this action.
The sixth member was out of the State

The sixth member was out of the State

and unavailable. We were all reluctani to
reach this decision but the willful entry
into files of great importance to the
University, together with other risks
critical to the functions of the
University, left no reasonable choice.
Among the documents stolen were
detailed budgets, including individual
salary information for most of the
University. The relevance of this
information to the objectives of the
April 3rd Movement is difficult to
understand.
Preliminary arrangements with the
Sheriff's associates had been made
carefully in order to handle such a
situation without violence if at all
possible, and with reasonable
opportunity for anyone to avoid arrest.
Faculty observers were part of the plan,
and many of you came on call early this
morning to assist. While there were
sensitive moments and all did not
exactly follow the plan, I am happy to
say that no one was arrested nor was
there any injury at all so far as the
police were concerned. There were
minor injuries when the building was
entered but nothing involving the
police. Those sitting-in fortunately
chose to vacate the building at that
time. After some threatening actions
outside of Encina, and a march through
certain portions of the President's
office, the group dispersed.
There are many who deserve great
commendation for their action last
night. Dick Lyman carried the
responsibility of the presidency and
carried it superbly. Joel Smith and Bill
Wyman handled their responsibilities of
the Dean of Students area with
distinction. I want to thank again the
Faculty Consultative Group and express
appreciation to at least ten other faculty
who spent much of the night making
visits to Encina on several occasions and
later helped to summon additional
faculty to organize the observer group.
Other administrative personnel handled
their responsibilities very well indeed.
The long hours and devoted service are
something which we should all
appreciate very much.
Today we have implemented the
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed and full notice and warning was
given throughout. This is in precise
accordance with the suggestions of the
Stanford Judicial Council should a
situation like this arise. In order that
this sanction be imposed properly on all
guilty parties, we will need your
assistance in identification of other
persons who may be identifiable from
photographs. The letters of suspension
which have been or are being sent out
read as follows:
To the Particular Individual:
In response to the suggestions made
by the Stanford Judicial Council in
its decision dated April 17, 1969, I
promulgated temporary regulations
regarding the occupation of
University buildings. Pursuant to
those regulations, the attached order
regarding the occupation of Encina
Hall was issued at 2:00 a.m., May 1,
1969. After the order was issued, all
occupants of the building were
warned and were given fifteen
minutes to leave the building. You
were identified as being present in
Encina Hall on May 1, 1969, after
the order was issued and after the
warnings and notice period.
Consequently, I hereby notify you
that you are temporarily suspended
from the University. During the
period of your suspension you may
not enter upon any part of the
campus of the University except to
participate in a proceedings called by
the Stanford Judicial Council, or for
some other specific purpose when

authorized by the office ol the Dean
of Students. Your suspension is
temporary and shall be in effect only
until such time as the Stanford
Judicial Council holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding your
violation or non-violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. A hearing will be granted
on request to the Council.
We are also in the process of seeking
an injunction or restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against both outsiders and
those now suspended if they persist in
destructive acts or in violation of the
terms of their suspension. I hope that
no one will be arrested, but if someone
insists on arrest, by willful violation of
the injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have to assemble again on this sort
of a subject this term, and we are
nearing the limits of this sort of thing, it
seems to me, and the will of the
community needs to be expressed to
those who would disrupt the processes,
interfere with the rights of others, in no
uncertain terms, and I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved.
Many students have expressed
concern that little is being accomplished
concerning the underlying issues about
which many of us have voiced our
opinions. I can testify from personal
knowledge that much is being done
toward as speedy a resolution of these
issues as is reasonable. Certainly
members of the Senate who have spent
an enormous amount of time recently
on various of the issues could certify to
that point most eloquently. Indeed,
many of us are spending so much of our
time on these particular matters that
other items of great importance to the
University are certainly being neglected.
Among other things which might be
mentioned are the referendum or
questionnaire sent to students and
faculty, the recent Open Hearing of the
Board Committee, special meetings of
the University Advisory Council, as I
have already said, great activity on the
part of the faculty Senate, and the
appointment of the Committee to
consider revision in the functions and
composition of the " Board of
Trustees—the Chairman of which, John
Gardner, has spent two days earlier this
week on the campus gaining the views
of many of you. In other words, it is
simply not true at all that important
issues are being stalled. There is a great
amount of attention. Procedures are
actually remarkably flexible and
responsive, it seems to me, and this
message, it seems to me, needs to be
conveyed to those who still seem to be
impatient about this. One cannot help
but suspect that in many cases it is not
really a matter of feeling that nothing is
being done but rather the question is, is
it being done to exactly the end that a
particular person seeks. As I say, I think
it is very important that you make this
clear to the students with whom you
can have contact and with whom you
can have influence, and that this be
done both promptly and repeatedly.
To date we have not had a major
catastrophe here at Stanford. I do not
know how much longer we can continue
to avoid such trying situations unless
faculty, staff and students decide to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels.
We have survived, as I say, relatively
unscathed up to this moment, but every
student, every faculty member, every
staff member must really consider the
long term implications of every action if
we are to confront the important days
ahead without a catastrophe which
could easily arise.

that this is a meeting of the Academic

correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, and I authorized
him to do so at once. The five available
members of the faculty Consultative
Group on Campus Disorders
unanimously recommended this action.
The sixth member was out of the State
\ViUii iiiiuiu 1IVJII1 */
and unavailable. We were all reluctani to
reach this decision but the willful entry
into files of great importance to the
University, together with other risks
critical to the functions of the
University, left no reasonable choice.
Among the documents stolen were
detailed budgets, including individual
salary information for most of the
University. The relevance of this
information to the objectives of the
April 3rd Movement is difficult to
understand.
Preliminary arrangements with the
Sheriff's associates had been made
carefully in order to handle such a
situation without violence if at all
possible, and with reasonable
opportunity for anyone to avoid arrest.
Faculty observers were part of the plan,
and many of you came on call early this
morning to assist. While there were
sensitive moments and all did not
exactly follow the plan, I am happy to
say that no one was arrested nor was
there any injury at all so far as the
police were concerned. There were
minor injuries when the building was
entered but nothing involving the
police. Those sitting-in fortunately
chose to vacate the building at that
time. After some threatening actions
outside of Encina, and a march through
certain portions of the President's
office, the group dispersed.
There are many who deserve great
commendation for their action last
night. Dick Lyman carried the
responsibility of the presidency and
carried it superbly. Joel Smith and Bill
Wyman handled their responsibilities of
the Dean of Students area with
distinction. I want to thank again the
Faculty Consultative Group and express
appreciation to at least ten other faculty
who spent much of the night making
visits to Encina on several occasions and
later helped to summon additional
faculty to organize the observer group.
Other administrative personnel handled
their responsibilities very well indeed.
The long hours and devoted service are
something which we should all
appreciate very much.
Today we have implemented the
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed and full notice and warning was
given throughout. This is in precise
accordance with the suggestions of the
Stanford Judicial Council should a
situation like this arise. In order that
this sanction be imposed properly on all
guilty parties, we will need your
assistance in identification of other
persons who may be identifiable from
photographs. The letters of suspension
which have been or are being sent out
read as follows:
To the Particular Individual:
In response to the suggestions made
by the Stanford Judicial Council in
its decision dated April 17, 1969, I
promulgated temporary regulations
regarding the occupation of
University buildings. Pursuant to
those regulations, the attached order
regarding the occupation of Encina
Hall was issued at 2:00 a.m., May 1,
1969. After the order was issued, all
occupants of the building were
warned and were given fifteen
minutes to leave the building. You
were identified as being present in
Encina Hall on May 1, 1969, after
the order was issued and after the
warnings and notice period.
Consequently, I hereby notify you
that you are temporarily suspended
from the University. During the
period of your suspension you may
not enter upon any part of the
campus of the University except to
participate in a proceedings called by
the Stanford Judicial Council, or for
some other specific purpose when

authorized by the office ol the Dean
of Students. Your suspension is
temporary and shall be in effect only
until such time as the Stanford
Judicial Council holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding your
violation or non-violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. A hearing will be granted
on request to the Council.
We are also in the process of seeking
an injunction or restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against both outsiders and
those now suspended if they persist in
destructive acts or in violation of the
terms of their suspension. I hope that
no one will be arrested, but if someone
insists on arrest, by willful violation of
the injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have to assemble again on this sort
of a subject this term, and we are
nearing the limits of this sort of thing, it
seems to me, and the will of the
community needs to be expressed to
those who would disrupt the processes,
interfere with the rights of others, in no
uncertain terms, and I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved.
Many students have expressed
concern that little is being accomplished
concerning the underlying issues about
which many of us have voiced our
opinions. I can testify from personal
knowledge that much is being done
toward as speedy a resolution of these
issues as is reasonable. Certainly
members of the Senate who have spent
an enormous amount of time recently
on various of the issues could certify to
that point most eloquently. Indeed,
many of us are spending so much of our
time on these particular matters that
other items of great importance to the
University are certainly being neglected.
Among other things which might be
mentioned are the referendum or
questionnaire sent to students and
faculty, the recent Open Hearing of the
Board Committee, special meetings of
the University Advisory Council, as I
have already said, great activity on the
part of the faculty Senate, and the
appointment of the Committee to
consider revision in the functions and
composition of the " Board of
Trustees—the Chairman of which, John
Gardner, has spent two days earlier this
week on the campus gaining the views
of many of you. In other words, it is
simply not true at all that important
issues are being stalled. There is a great
amount of attention. Procedures are
actually remarkably flexible and
responsive, it seems to me, and this
message, it seems to me, needs to be
conveyed to those who still seem to be
impatient about this. One cannot help
but suspect that in many cases it is not
really a matter of feeling that nothing is
being done but rather the question is, is
it being done to exactly the end that a
particular person seeks. As I say, I think
it is very important that you make this
clear to the students with whom you
can have contact and with whom you
can have influence, and that this be
done both promptly and repeatedly.
To date we have not had a major
catastrophe here at Stanford. I do not
know how much longer we can continue
to avoid such trying situations unless
faculty, staff and students decide to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels.
We have survived, as I say, relatively
unscathed up to this moment, but every
student, every faculty member, every
staff member must really consider the
long term implications of every action if
we are to confront the important days
ahead without a catastrophe which
could easily arise.
I would like to announce as before
that this is a meeting of the Academic
Council open to the regular members,
the Senior Members, Emeriti, and
invited guests, Dean Smith, Dean
Wyman, Dean Rosch, Dean Rosenzweig,
Mr. Beyers, Mrs. Coffey, the new ASSU
President, Pat Shea, and the most
recent—the recently retired President,
Denis Hayes. In inviting the Student
Association Presidents we are following
the action of the Senate which seemed
an appropriate precedent for this body
also.
I would also like to announce right at
the beginning, before getting into the
principal business, that the Senate
meeting displaced by this meeting of the
Academic Council this afternoon will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
in the usual place, and, as I understand
it, the agenda for tomorrow afternoon is
the single item of relations with SRI,
which has been the subject of extended
discussions already.
It is just short of two weeks since we

met in a special session of this body on
much the same subject. This meeting, as
before, concerns the capacity of the
campus to maintain conditions in which
teaching and research can effectively
take place. As I stated at that meeting,
and again in the letter of April 23 to
you, it was our intention to use all of
the machinery, the sanctions, the
methods, the persuasion of our internal
mechanism, including the suggestions of
the Judicial Council, and, in particular,
the immediate temporary suspension of
students in case of another Sit-In. Such
a Sit-In did occur last night in Encina
Hall, and these sanctions were applied
promptly. Unfortunately, the students
in Encina—at least most of them—did
not respond to either the advice and
persuasion of student leaders and of
faculty who visited the Hall or to the
persuasion of these sanctions. Also I am
sorry to say that the tone of this
episode was much more destructive than
that at the AEL. I will ask Dr. Lyman
and other firsthand observers to report

to you on this presently, but the broken
doors, the rifled files, the damaged
typewriters, were all evidence to me this
morning. Actually, I made a quick trip
to Los Angeles last night—yesterday
afternoon—to address the dinner of the
Stanford Associates. The last word that
I had received during the evening
indicated that a Sit-In was not likely.
Nevertheless, it seemed wise to return to
Stanford, but I retired and slept on the
assumption that there was no difficulty.
Actually then I was called at 4:00 a.m.
and received a report the equivalent of
which, I am sure, will be given to you
by Dr. Lyman in a few moments, and it
convinced me that he was entirely
correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa

its decision dated April 17, 1969, I
promulgated temporary regulations
regarding the occupation of
University buildings. Pursuant to
those regulations, the attached order
regarding the occupation of Encina
Hall was issued at 2:00 a.m., May 1,
1969. After the order was issued, all
occupants of the building were
warned and were given fifteen
minutes to leave the building. You
were identified as being present in
Encina Hall on May 1, 1969, after
the order was issued and after the
warnings and notice period.
Consequently, I hereby notify you
that you are temporarily suspended
from the University. During the
period of your suspension you may
not enter upon any part of the
campus of the University except to
participate in a proceedings called by
the Stanford Judicial Council, or for
some other specific purpose when

authorized by the office ol the Dean
of Students. Your suspension is
temporary and shall be in effect only
until such time as the Stanford
Judicial Council holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding your
violation or non-violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. A hearing will be granted
on request to the Council.
We are also in the process of seeking
an injunction or restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against both outsiders and
those now suspended if they persist in
destructive acts or in violation of the
terms of their suspension. I hope that
no one will be arrested, but if someone
insists on arrest, by willful violation of
the injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have to assemble again on this sort
of a subject this term, and we are
nearing the limits of this sort of thing, it
seems to me, and the will of the
community needs to be expressed to
those who would disrupt the processes,
interfere with the rights of others, in no
uncertain terms, and I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved.
Many students have expressed
concern that little is being accomplished
concerning the underlying issues about
which many of us have voiced our
opinions. I can testify from personal
knowledge that much is being done
toward as speedy a resolution of these
issues as is reasonable. Certainly
members of the Senate who have spent
an enormous amount of time recently
on various of the issues could certify to
that point most eloquently. Indeed,
many of us are spending so much of our
time on these particular matters that
other items of great importance to the
University are certainly being neglected.
Among other things which might be
mentioned are the referendum or
questionnaire sent to students and
faculty, the recent Open Hearing of the
Board Committee, special meetings of
the University Advisory Council, as I
have already said, great activity on the
part of the faculty Senate, and the
appointment of the Committee to
consider revision in the functions and
composition of the " Board of
Trustees—the Chairman of which, John
Gardner, has spent two days earlier this
week on the campus gaining the views
of many of you. In other words, it is
simply not true at all that important
issues are being stalled. There is a great
amount of attention. Procedures are
actually remarkably flexible and
responsive, it seems to me, and this
message, it seems to me, needs to be
conveyed to those who still seem to be
impatient about this. One cannot help
but suspect that in many cases it is not
really a matter of feeling that nothing is
being done but rather the question is, is
it being done to exactly the end that a
particular person seeks. As I say, I think
it is very important that you make this
clear to the students with whom you
can have contact and with whom you
can have influence, and that this be
done both promptly and repeatedly.
To date we have not had a major
catastrophe here at Stanford. I do not
know how much longer we can continue
to avoid such trying situations unless
faculty, staff and students decide to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels.
We have survived, as I say, relatively
unscathed up to this moment, but every
student, every faculty member, every
staff member must really consider the
long term implications of every action if
we are to confront the important days
ahead without a catastrophe which
could easily arise.
I would like to announce as before
that this is a meeting of the Academic
Council open to the regular members,
the Senior Members, Emeriti, and
invited guests, Dean Smith, Dean
Wyman, Dean Rosch, Dean Rosenzweig,
Mr. Beyers, Mrs. Coffey, the new ASSU
President, Pat Shea, and the most
recent—the recently retired President,
Denis Hayes. In inviting the Student
Association Presidents we are following
the action of the Senate which seemed
an appropriate precedent for this body
also.
I would also like to announce right at
the beginning, before getting into the
principal business, that the Senate
meeting displaced by this meeting of the
Academic Council this afternoon will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
in the usual place, and, as I understand
it, the agenda for tomorrow afternoon is
the single item of relations with SRI,
which has been the subject of extended
discussions already.
It is just short of two weeks since we

met in a special session of this body on
much the same subject. This meeting, as
before, concerns the capacity of the
campus to maintain conditions in which
teaching and research can effectively
take place. As I stated at that meeting,
and again in the letter of April 23 to
you, it was our intention to use all of
the machinery, the sanctions, the
methods, the persuasion of our internal
mechanism, including the suggestions of
the Judicial Council, and, in particular,
the immediate temporary suspension of
students in case of another Sit-In. Such
a Sit-In did occur last night in Encina
Hall, and these sanctions were applied
promptly. Unfortunately, the students
in Encina—at least most of them—did
not respond to either the advice and
persuasion of student leaders and of
faculty who visited the Hall or to the
persuasion of these sanctions. Also I am
sorry to say that the tone of this
episode was much more destructive than
that at the AEL. I will ask Dr. Lyman
and other firsthand observers to report

to you on this presently, but the broken
doors, the rifled files, the damaged
typewriters, were all evidence to me this
morning. Actually, I made a quick trip
to Los Angeles last night—yesterday
afternoon—to address the dinner of the
Stanford Associates. The last word that
I had received during the evening
indicated that a Sit-In was not likely.
Nevertheless, it seemed wise to return to
Stanford, but I retired and slept on the
assumption that there was no difficulty.
Actually then I was called at 4:00 a.m.
and received a report the equivalent of
which, I am sure, will be given to you
by Dr. Lyman in a few moments, and it
convinced me that he was entirely
correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, and I authorized
him to do so at once. The five available
members of the faculty Consultative
Group on Campus Disorders
unanimously recommended this action.
The sixth member was out of the State
\ViUii iiiiuiu 1IVJII1 */
and unavailable. We were all reluctani to
reach this decision but the willful entry
into files of great importance to the
University, together with other risks
critical to the functions of the
University, left no reasonable choice.
Among the documents stolen were
detailed budgets, including individual
salary information for most of the
University. The relevance of this
information to the objectives of the
April 3rd Movement is difficult to
understand.
Preliminary arrangements with the
Sheriff's associates had been made
carefully in order to handle such a
situation without violence if at all
possible, and with reasonable
opportunity for anyone to avoid arrest.
Faculty observers were part of the plan,
and many of you came on call early this
morning to assist. While there were
sensitive moments and all did not
exactly follow the plan, I am happy to
say that no one was arrested nor was
there any injury at all so far as the
police were concerned. There were
minor injuries when the building was
entered but nothing involving the
police. Those sitting-in fortunately
chose to vacate the building at that
time. After some threatening actions
outside of Encina, and a march through
certain portions of the President's
office, the group dispersed.
There are many who deserve great
commendation for their action last
night. Dick Lyman carried the
responsibility of the presidency and
carried it superbly. Joel Smith and Bill
Wyman handled their responsibilities of
the Dean of Students area with
distinction. I want to thank again the
Faculty Consultative Group and express
appreciation to at least ten other faculty
who spent much of the night making
visits to Encina on several occasions and
later helped to summon additional
faculty to organize the observer group.
Other administrative personnel handled
their responsibilities very well indeed.
The long hours and devoted service are
something which we should all
appreciate very much.
Today we have implemented the
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed and full notice and warning was
given throughout. This is in precise
accordance with the suggestions of the
Stanford Judicial Council should a
situation like this arise. In order that
this sanction be imposed properly on all
guilty parties, we will need your
assistance in identification of other
persons who may be identifiable from
photographs. The letters of suspension
which have been or are being sent out
read as follows:

Board Committee, special meetings of
the University Advisory Council, as I
have already said, great activity on the
part of the faculty Senate, and the
appointment of the Committee to
consider revision in the functions and
composition of the " Board of
Trustees—the Chairman of which, John
Gardner, has spent two days earlier this
week on the campus gaining the views
of many of you. In other words, it is
simply not true at all that important
issues are being stalled. There is a great
amount of attention. Procedures are
actually remarkably flexible and
responsive, it seems to me, and this
message, it seems to me, needs to be
conveyed to those who still seem to be
impatient about this. One cannot help
but suspect that in many cases it is not
really a matter of feeling that nothing is
being done but rather the question is, is
it being done to exactly the end that a
particular person seeks. As I say, I think
it is very important that you make this
clear to the students with whom you
can have contact and with whom you
can have influence, and that this be
done both promptly and repeatedly.
To date we have not had a major
catastrophe here at Stanford. I do not
know how much longer we can continue
to avoid such trying situations unless
faculty, staff and students decide to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels.
We have survived, as I say, relatively
unscathed up to this moment, but every
student, every faculty member, every
staff member must really consider the
long term implications of every action if
we are to confront the important days
ahead without a catastrophe which
could easily arise.
I would like to announce as before
that this is a meeting of the Academic
Council open to the regular members,
the Senior Members, Emeriti, and
invited guests, Dean Smith, Dean
Wyman, Dean Rosch, Dean Rosenzweig,
Mr. Beyers, Mrs. Coffey, the new ASSU
President, Pat Shea, and the most
recent—the recently retired President,
Denis Hayes. In inviting the Student
Association Presidents we are following
the action of the Senate which seemed
an appropriate precedent for this body
also.
I would also like to announce right at
the beginning, before getting into the
principal business, that the Senate
meeting displaced by this meeting of the
Academic Council this afternoon will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
in the usual place, and, as I understand
it, the agenda for tomorrow afternoon is
the single item of relations with SRI,
which has been the subject of extended
discussions already.
It is just short of two weeks since we

met in a special session of this body on
much the same subject. This meeting, as
before, concerns the capacity of the
campus to maintain conditions in which
teaching and research can effectively
take place. As I stated at that meeting,
and again in the letter of April 23 to
you, it was our intention to use all of
the machinery, the sanctions, the
methods, the persuasion of our internal
mechanism, including the suggestions of
the Judicial Council, and, in particular,
the immediate temporary suspension of
students in case of another Sit-In. Such
a Sit-In did occur last night in Encina
Hall, and these sanctions were applied
promptly. Unfortunately, the students
in Encina—at least most of them—did
not respond to either the advice and
persuasion of student leaders and of
faculty who visited the Hall or to the
persuasion of these sanctions. Also I am
sorry to say that the tone of this
episode was much more destructive than
that at the AEL. I will ask Dr. Lyman
and other firsthand observers to report

to you on this presently, but the broken
doors, the rifled files, the damaged
typewriters, were all evidence to me this
morning. Actually, I made a quick trip
to Los Angeles last night—yesterday
afternoon—to address the dinner of the
Stanford Associates. The last word that
I had received during the evening
indicated that a Sit-In was not likely.
Nevertheless, it seemed wise to return to
Stanford, but I retired and slept on the
assumption that there was no difficulty.
Actually then I was called at 4:00 a.m.
and received a report the equivalent of
which, I am sure, will be given to you
by Dr. Lyman in a few moments, and it
convinced me that he was entirely
correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, and I authorized
him to do so at once. The five available
members of the faculty Consultative
Group on Campus Disorders
unanimously recommended this action.
The sixth member was out of the State
\ViUii iiiiuiu 1IVJII1 */
and unavailable. We were all reluctani to
reach this decision but the willful entry
into files of great importance to the
University, together with other risks
critical to the functions of the
University, left no reasonable choice.
Among the documents stolen were
detailed budgets, including individual
salary information for most of the
University. The relevance of this
information to the objectives of the
April 3rd Movement is difficult to
understand.
Preliminary arrangements with the
Sheriff's associates had been made
carefully in order to handle such a
situation without violence if at all
possible, and with reasonable
opportunity for anyone to avoid arrest.
Faculty observers were part of the plan,
and many of you came on call early this
morning to assist. While there were
sensitive moments and all did not
exactly follow the plan, I am happy to
say that no one was arrested nor was
there any injury at all so far as the
police were concerned. There were
minor injuries when the building was
entered but nothing involving the
police. Those sitting-in fortunately
chose to vacate the building at that
time. After some threatening actions
outside of Encina, and a march through
certain portions of the President's
office, the group dispersed.
There are many who deserve great
commendation for their action last
night. Dick Lyman carried the
responsibility of the presidency and
carried it superbly. Joel Smith and Bill
Wyman handled their responsibilities of
the Dean of Students area with
distinction. I want to thank again the
Faculty Consultative Group and express
appreciation to at least ten other faculty
who spent much of the night making
visits to Encina on several occasions and
later helped to summon additional
faculty to organize the observer group.
Other administrative personnel handled
their responsibilities very well indeed.
The long hours and devoted service are
something which we should all
appreciate very much.
Today we have implemented the
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed and full notice and warning was
given throughout. This is in precise
accordance with the suggestions of the
Stanford Judicial Council should a
situation like this arise. In order that
this sanction be imposed properly on all
guilty parties, we will need your
assistance in identification of other
persons who may be identifiable from
photographs. The letters of suspension
which have been or are being sent out
read as follows:
To the Particular Individual:
In response to the suggestions made
by the Stanford Judicial Council in
its decision dated April 17, 1969, I
promulgated temporary regulations
regarding the occupation of
University buildings. Pursuant to
those regulations, the attached order
regarding the occupation of Encina
Hall was issued at 2:00 a.m., May 1,
1969. After the order was issued, all
occupants of the building were
warned and were given fifteen
minutes to leave the building. You
were identified as being present in
Encina Hall on May 1, 1969, after
the order was issued and after the
warnings and notice period.
Consequently, I hereby notify you
that you are temporarily suspended
from the University. During the
period of your suspension you may
not enter upon any part of the
campus of the University except to
participate in a proceedings called by
the Stanford Judicial Council, or for
some other specific purpose when

authorized by the office ol the Dean
of Students. Your suspension is
temporary and shall be in effect only
until such time as the Stanford
Judicial Council holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding your
violation or non-violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. A hearing will be granted
on request to the Council.
We are also in the process of seeking
an injunction or restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against both outsiders and
those now suspended if they persist in
destructive acts or in violation of the
terms of their suspension. I hope that
no one will be arrested, but if someone
insists on arrest, by willful violation of
the injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have to assemble again on this sort
of a subject this term, and we are
nearing the limits of this sort of thing, it
seems to me, and the will of the
community needs to be expressed to
those who would disrupt the processes,
interfere with the rights of others, in no
uncertain terms, and I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved.
Many students have expressed
concern that little is being accomplished
concerning the underlying issues about
which many of us have voiced our
opinions. I can testify from personal
knowledge that much is being done
toward as speedy a resolution of these
issues as is reasonable. Certainly
members of the Senate who have spent
an enormous amount of time recently
on various of the issues could certify to
that point most eloquently. Indeed,
many of us are spending so much of our
time on these particular matters that
other items of great importance to the
University are certainly being neglected.
Among other things which might be
mentioned are the referendum or
questionnaire sent to students and
faculty, the recent Open Hearing of the
Board Committee, special meetings of
the University Advisory Council, as I
have already said, great activity on the
part of the faculty Senate, and the
appointment of the Committee to
consider revision in the functions and
composition of the " Board of

before, concerns the capacity of the
campus to maintain conditions in which
teaching and research can effectively
take place. As I stated at that meeting,
and again in the letter of April 23 to
you, it was our intention to use all of
the machinery, the sanctions, the
methods, the persuasion of our internal
mechanism, including the suggestions of
the Judicial Council, and, in particular,
the immediate temporary suspension of
students in case of another Sit-In. Such
a Sit-In did occur last night in Encina
Hall, and these sanctions were applied
promptly. Unfortunately, the students
in Encina—at least most of them—did
not respond to either the advice and
persuasion of student leaders and of
faculty who visited the Hall or to the
persuasion of these sanctions. Also I am
sorry to say that the tone of this
episode was much more destructive than
that at the AEL. I will ask Dr. Lyman
and other firsthand observers to report

to you on this presently, but the broken
doors, the rifled files, the damaged
typewriters, were all evidence to me this
morning. Actually, I made a quick trip
to Los Angeles last night—yesterday
afternoon—to address the dinner of the
Stanford Associates. The last word that
I had received during the evening
indicated that a Sit-In was not likely.
Nevertheless, it seemed wise to return to
Stanford, but I retired and slept on the
assumption that there was no difficulty.
Actually then I was called at 4:00 a.m.
and received a report the equivalent of
which, I am sure, will be given to you
by Dr. Lyman in a few moments, and it
convinced me that he was entirely
correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, and I authorized
him to do so at once. The five available
members of the faculty Consultative
Group on Campus Disorders
unanimously recommended this action.
The sixth member was out of the State
\ViUii iiiiuiu 1IVJII1 */
and unavailable. We were all reluctani to
reach this decision but the willful entry
into files of great importance to the
University, together with other risks
critical to the functions of the
University, left no reasonable choice.
Among the documents stolen were
detailed budgets, including individual
salary information for most of the
University. The relevance of this
information to the objectives of the
April 3rd Movement is difficult to
understand.
Preliminary arrangements with the
Sheriff's associates had been made
carefully in order to handle such a
situation without violence if at all
possible, and with reasonable
opportunity for anyone to avoid arrest.
Faculty observers were part of the plan,
and many of you came on call early this
morning to assist. While there were
sensitive moments and all did not
exactly follow the plan, I am happy to
say that no one was arrested nor was
there any injury at all so far as the
police were concerned. There were
minor injuries when the building was
entered but nothing involving the
police. Those sitting-in fortunately
chose to vacate the building at that
time. After some threatening actions
outside of Encina, and a march through
certain portions of the President's
office, the group dispersed.
There are many who deserve great
commendation for their action last
night. Dick Lyman carried the
responsibility of the presidency and
carried it superbly. Joel Smith and Bill
Wyman handled their responsibilities of
the Dean of Students area with
distinction. I want to thank again the
Faculty Consultative Group and express
appreciation to at least ten other faculty
who spent much of the night making
visits to Encina on several occasions and
later helped to summon additional
faculty to organize the observer group.
Other administrative personnel handled
their responsibilities very well indeed.
The long hours and devoted service are
something which we should all
appreciate very much.
Today we have implemented the
temporary suspensions of those
identified last night as remaining in
Encina after the building was declared
closed and full notice and warning was
given throughout. This is in precise
accordance with the suggestions of the
Stanford Judicial Council should a
situation like this arise. In order that
this sanction be imposed properly on all
guilty parties, we will need your
assistance in identification of other
persons who may be identifiable from
photographs. The letters of suspension
which have been or are being sent out
read as follows:
To the Particular Individual:
In response to the suggestions made
by the Stanford Judicial Council in
its decision dated April 17, 1969, I
promulgated temporary regulations
regarding the occupation of
University buildings. Pursuant to
those regulations, the attached order
regarding the occupation of Encina
Hall was issued at 2:00 a.m., May 1,
1969. After the order was issued, all
occupants of the building were
warned and were given fifteen
minutes to leave the building. You
were identified as being present in
Encina Hall on May 1, 1969, after
the order was issued and after the
warnings and notice period.
Consequently, I hereby notify you
that you are temporarily suspended
from the University. During the
period of your suspension you may
not enter upon any part of the
campus of the University except to
participate in a proceedings called by
the Stanford Judicial Council, or for
some other specific purpose when

authorized by the office ol the Dean
of Students. Your suspension is
temporary and shall be in effect only
until such time as the Stanford
Judicial Council holds a hearing and
renders a decision regarding your
violation or non-violation of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. A hearing will be granted
on request to the Council.
We are also in the process of seeking
an injunction or restraining order from
the appropriate legal authorities to bring
restraint against both outsiders and
those now suspended if they persist in
destructive acts or in violation of the
terms of their suspension. I hope that
no one will be arrested, but if someone
insists on arrest, by willful violation of
the injunction, assuming that it issues, I
suppose we shall be obliged to have that
happen. Naturally I am very sorry that
we have to assemble again on this sort
of a subject this term, and we are
nearing the limits of this sort of thing, it
seems to me, and the will of the
community needs to be expressed to
those who would disrupt the processes,
interfere with the rights of others, in no
uncertain terms, and I think this is best
done, as I said, individually by all of
you in contact with students or others
that might be involved.
Many students have expressed
concern that little is being accomplished
concerning the underlying issues about
which many of us have voiced our
opinions. I can testify from personal
knowledge that much is being done
toward as speedy a resolution of these
issues as is reasonable. Certainly
members of the Senate who have spent
an enormous amount of time recently
on various of the issues could certify to
that point most eloquently. Indeed,
many of us are spending so much of our
time on these particular matters that
other items of great importance to the
University are certainly being neglected.
Among other things which might be
mentioned are the referendum or
questionnaire sent to students and
faculty, the recent Open Hearing of the
Board Committee, special meetings of
the University Advisory Council, as I
have already said, great activity on the
part of the faculty Senate, and the
appointment of the Committee to
consider revision in the functions and
composition of the " Board of
Trustees—the Chairman of which, John
Gardner, has spent two days earlier this
week on the campus gaining the views
of many of you. In other words, it is
simply not true at all that important
issues are being stalled. There is a great
amount of attention. Procedures are
actually remarkably flexible and
responsive, it seems to me, and this
message, it seems to me, needs to be
conveyed to those who still seem to be
impatient about this. One cannot help
but suspect that in many cases it is not
really a matter of feeling that nothing is
being done but rather the question is, is
it being done to exactly the end that a
particular person seeks. As I say, I think
it is very important that you make this
clear to the students with whom you
can have contact and with whom you
can have influence, and that this be
done both promptly and repeatedly.
To date we have not had a major
catastrophe here at Stanford. I do not
know how much longer we can continue
to avoid such trying situations unless
faculty, staff and students decide to
rededicate themselves to the creation of
a spirit of mutual trust and decision
making through recognized channels.
We have survived, as I say, relatively
unscathed up to this moment, but every
student, every faculty member, every
staff member must really consider the
long term implications of every action if
we are to confront the important days
ahead without a catastrophe which
could easily arise.
