# Pitzer's Speech To Council
## 
### 
I would like to announce as before
that this is a meeting of the Academic
Council open to the regular members,
the Senior Members, Emeriti, and
invited guests, Dean Smith, Dean
Wyman, Dean Rosch, Dean Rosenzweig,
Mr. Beyers, Mrs. Coffey, the new ASSU
President, Pat Shea, and the most
recent—the recently retired President,
Denis Hayes. In inviting the Student
Association Presidents we are following
the action of the Senate which seemed
an appropriate precedent for this body
also.
I would also like to announce right at
the beginning, before getting into the
principal business, that the Senate
meeting displaced by this meeting of the
Academic Council this afternoon will be
held tomorrow afternoon at 3:15 p.m.
in the usual place, and, as I understand
it, the agenda for tomorrow afternoon is
the single item of relations with SRI,
which has been the subject of extended
discussions already.
It is just short of two weeks since we

met in a special session of this body on
much the same subject. This meeting, as
before, concerns the capacity of the
campus to maintain conditions in which
teaching and research can effectively
take place. As I stated at that meeting,
and again in the letter of April 23 to
you, it was our intention to use all of
the machinery, the sanctions, the
methods, the persuasion of our internal
mechanism, including the suggestions of
the Judicial Council, and, in particular,
the immediate temporary suspension of
students in case of another Sit-In. Such
a Sit-In did occur last night in Encina
Hall, and these sanctions were applied
promptly. Unfortunately, the students
in Encina—at least most of them—did
not respond to either the advice and
persuasion of student leaders and of
faculty who visited the Hall or to the
persuasion of these sanctions. Also I am
sorry to say that the tone of this
episode was much more destructive than
that at the AEL. I will ask Dr. Lyman
and other firsthand observers to report

to you on this presently, but the broken
doors, the rifled files, the damaged
typewriters, were all evidence to me this
morning. Actually, I made a quick trip
to Los Angeles last night—yesterday
afternoon—to address the dinner of the
Stanford Associates. The last word that
I had received during the evening
indicated that a Sit-In was not likely.
Nevertheless, it seemed wise to return to
Stanford, but I retired and slept on the
assumption that there was no difficulty.
Actually then I was called at 4:00 a.m.
and received a report the equivalent of
which, I am sure, will be given to you
by Dr. Lyman in a few moments, and it
convinced me that he was entirely
correct in recommending that the
situation required summoning the Santa
Clara County Sheriff, and I authorized
him to do so at once. The five available
members of the faculty Consultative
Group on Campus Disorders
unanimously recommended this action.
The sixth member was out of the State
