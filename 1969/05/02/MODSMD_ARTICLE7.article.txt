# Restraint?

### 
The past forty-eight hours at Stanford
has witnessed the clash ot two lorces,each
wrongly believing all right was on its side
and total justice in its actions.
Early Thursday morning, members of
the April 3rd Movement rashly decided to
occupy Encina Hall. The mood of their
Wednesday night meetings, and the style ot
their action produced great bitterness on
campus. At 7 a.m. yesterday, 125 police
were summoned onto campus to stop the
demonstration. It was ended for them by
the demonstrators, who fearing arrest, left
Encina.
The arrival of police-perhaps the need
lor police—signified that confrontation at
Stanford has reached a new level. It is a
very dangerous level because the
antagonists may quickly overreact to each
other, a process that can escalate
indefi nately.
The process, in fact, has already begun.
The sit-in at Encina was an overreaction to
the frustration of delay by Trustees on the
SRI issue. Interestingly, the
administration's response of
pol ice ~n ormally an inflamatory
move-turned out to be less of an explosion
than their legal action yesterday against
demonstrators.
President Pitzer temporarily suspended
part of the crowd which had spent the
night in Encina, notifying them that they
may not set foot on campus except to
attend a hearing of the Stanford Judicial
Council. As if that were not enough, the
administration sought and received a
temporary restraining order from Superior

Court, which backs up the University
suspension with threat of arrest should any
student violate the terms of his suspension.
The court order raises more questions
than it settles and has the potential to
produce exactly the disruption it seeks to
end. By calling the police yesterday, the
administration admitted that the internal
governing system at Stanford is unable to
handle the crisis on campus. The court
injunction is a logical second step in using
external authority.
Clearly, after the demonstration in
Encina and the subsequent brief foray into
the President's office, the April 3rd people
gave Pitzer legitimate cause for great
concern about preserving a semblance of
peace. It seems, however, that his action
itself threatens the peace, and bring
Stanford ever closer to losing control of its
own destiny.
The injunction is a very legal affair with
complexities that confuse a layman's mind
and excite his political emotions. It appears
overly stringent to prevent a suspended
student from coming onto the campus,
holding the threat of arrest over his head.
The demonstrators at Encina, with few
exceptions, do not work for destruction of
Stanford. They work for change, change
which is desired by many on campus.
Stanford has now pushed them off
campus, apparently afraid of further
disruption, but unafraid that the move may
appear as politically intolerant and
repressive.
The President should hold his ace until
he really needs it.

temporary restraining order from Superior

Court, which backs up the University
suspension with threat of arrest should any
student violate the terms of his suspension.
The court order raises more questions
than it settles and has the potential to
produce exactly the disruption it seeks to
end. By calling the police yesterday, the
administration admitted that the internal
governing system at Stanford is unable to
handle the crisis on campus. The court
injunction is a logical second step in using
external authority.
Clearly, after the demonstration in
Encina and the subsequent brief foray into
the President's office, the April 3rd people
gave Pitzer legitimate cause for great
concern about preserving a semblance of
peace. It seems, however, that his action
itself threatens the peace, and bring
Stanford ever closer to losing control of its
own destiny.
The injunction is a very legal affair with
complexities that confuse a layman's mind
and excite his political emotions. It appears
overly stringent to prevent a suspended
student from coming onto the campus,
holding the threat of arrest over his head.
The demonstrators at Encina, with few
exceptions, do not work for destruction of
Stanford. They work for change, change
which is desired by many on campus.
Stanford has now pushed them off
campus, apparently afraid of further
disruption, but unafraid that the move may
appear as politically intolerant and
repressive.
The President should hold his ace until
he really needs it.
The past forty-eight hours at Stanford
has witnessed the clash ot two lorces,each
wrongly believing all right was on its side
and total justice in its actions.
Early Thursday morning, members of
the April 3rd Movement rashly decided to
occupy Encina Hall. The mood of their
Wednesday night meetings, and the style ot
their action produced great bitterness on
campus. At 7 a.m. yesterday, 125 police
were summoned onto campus to stop the
demonstration. It was ended for them by
the demonstrators, who fearing arrest, left
Encina.
The arrival of police-perhaps the need
lor police—signified that confrontation at
Stanford has reached a new level. It is a
very dangerous level because the
antagonists may quickly overreact to each
other, a process that can escalate
indefi nately.
The process, in fact, has already begun.
The sit-in at Encina was an overreaction to
the frustration of delay by Trustees on the
SRI issue. Interestingly, the
administration's response of
pol ice ~n ormally an inflamatory
move-turned out to be less of an explosion
than their legal action yesterday against
demonstrators.
President Pitzer temporarily suspended
part of the crowd which had spent the
night in Encina, notifying them that they
may not set foot on campus except to
attend a hearing of the Stanford Judicial
Council. As if that were not enough, the
administration sought and received a
temporary restraining order from Superior

Court, which backs up the University
suspension with threat of arrest should any
student violate the terms of his suspension.
