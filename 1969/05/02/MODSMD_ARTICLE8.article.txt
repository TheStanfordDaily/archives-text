# Rhetoric Similar
## Joe McCarthy 'Witch Hunts' 
### William F.U. U'Ren 
In viewing the activities of SDS
and other student groups on
campus during the last six or
seven months, it has become
evident to me that the rhetoric I
hear now is very similar to what I
was subjected to as an
undergraduate in the 1950s at the
University of California at
Berkeley.
In those days the faculty was
faced with a little different
problem, i.e., they were told to
sign the special loyalty oath or get
out. This was the day of the
Joseph McCarthy witch hunts,
and professors were being told not
to study communism, etc.,
because the McCarthy followers
had determined that all that type
of research was morally wrong.
Therefore, the professor should
forget about examining such
morally objectionable writings as
the Communist Manifesto, etc.,
and go about his business of
enlightening the youth of the
nation in what we have
determined is morally acceptable
subject matter.
Fortunately, professors took
the position that they could not
determine what was morally
wrong with this subject area
unless they examined it very
carefully.
Another Group
Now, the professor finds
himself faced with another
"eniightened" group that has
made another determination as to
what is or is not morally
objectionable. The faculty is now
told to sign this restrictive
research covenant, and then go
out and enlighten your students in
those areas that we have
determined are morally correct.
We have decided that war
related research is not your "bag."
Of course, if we would have paid
some attention to what Mao
Tse-tung and Ramon Magsaysay
have done and said, we might not
be in the mess we presently face
in Vietnam.
Magsaysay found that to
counter-insurgency you had to go
out and find out what the
underlying problems were, and
then work to overcome these
problems, i.e., meet the needs of
the people. President Kennedy in
his second "State of the Union"
message pointed out to the
American people that the real
crux of the problem of
counter-insurgency rested in many
political factors, e.g.,
modernization and reform.
Where do we find the tools to

deal with this problem? Do we
look to the Defense Department?
If the President would have paid a
little more attention to the
research projects coming from this
and other campuses, we might
have been able to prevent what is
now going on in Vietnam.
The problems in Vietnam are
really not military, but they are
basically political, economic,
social, etc. So where do you find
the talent to examine these
problems? If you turn to the
Defense Department's war
machine, then you have failed,
because as Magsaysay learned
physical force is not the answer.
Where better to turn than to the
one area where the greatest single
group of talent to answer your
problems is available, i.e., the
college campus. Wars are not
begun because people are
knowledgeable; they are begun
through ignorance.
Peace with USSR
In the last fifteen or twenty
years we have learned to live in
peace with the Soviet Union. We
have not maintained this Peace,
such as it is, through the wisdom
of the McCarthys or the others
who would have us burying our
head in the sand. The students on
this campus today are the
benefactors of those professors
who stood up and told McCarthy,
et al, what it was really all about.
But the strange thing to me is that
those same students are the ones
who are telling professors, "you
have gone far enough now, and
you were right in the 1950s to
stand up to McCarthy, but you
must stop your inquiry now
because it is morally wrong, i.e.,
you must not stand up against us
because we, unlike McCarthy,
have the correct moral prospective
in this area."
Obviously, this is an
oversimplified analogy, but it

appears to me that it raises some
questions that have not been
answered, and I just hope that it
will make some students stop and
re-evaluate their positions. I think
that there are many pressing
problems facing this country at
the present time, and it is good
for the student to be involved.
But I think that students should
examine where and how they are
going, and realize that without the
knowledge necessary to
accomplish the task, they are
doomed to failure.
Knowledge is not gained by
drawing up some vague moral
standard, and saying , "Here is the
line, if you cross it, you may fall
off the edge, but just to make sure
you don't fall off and hurt
yourself, we are going to sit here
in front of you and protect you
from your own inquisitive
nature." Knowledge is gained
through inquiry, research and
hard work. It is strange to see the
student attack inquiry; when what
he wants to attack is the use of
that knowledge.

I'm afraid I don't have any
simple answer to that dilemma,
but I end this letter with the
words of Samuel Johnson:
"Integrity without knowledge
is weak and useless, and
knowledge without integrity is
dangerous and dreadful."

problem, i.e., they were told to
sign the special loyalty oath or get
out. This was the day of the
Joseph McCarthy witch hunts,
and professors were being told not
to study communism, etc.,
because the McCarthy followers
had determined that all that type
of research was morally wrong.
Therefore, the professor should
forget about examining such
morally objectionable writings as
the Communist Manifesto, etc.,
and go about his business of
enlightening the youth of the
nation in what we have
determined is morally acceptable
subject matter.
Fortunately, professors took
the position that they could not
determine what was morally
wrong with this subject area
unless they examined it very
carefully.
Another Group
Now, the professor finds
himself faced with another
"eniightened" group that has
made another determination as to
what is or is not morally
objectionable. The faculty is now
told to sign this restrictive
research covenant, and then go
out and enlighten your students in
those areas that we have
determined are morally correct.
We have decided that war
related research is not your "bag."
Of course, if we would have paid
some attention to what Mao
Tse-tung and Ramon Magsaysay
have done and said, we might not
be in the mess we presently face
in Vietnam.
Magsaysay found that to
counter-insurgency you had to go
out and find out what the
underlying problems were, and
then work to overcome these
problems, i.e., meet the needs of
the people. President Kennedy in
his second "State of the Union"
message pointed out to the
American people that the real
crux of the problem of
counter-insurgency rested in many
political factors, e.g.,
modernization and reform.
Where do we find the tools to

deal with this problem? Do we
look to the Defense Department?
If the President would have paid a
little more attention to the
research projects coming from this
and other campuses, we might
have been able to prevent what is
now going on in Vietnam.
The problems in Vietnam are
really not military, but they are
basically political, economic,
social, etc. So where do you find
the talent to examine these
problems? If you turn to the
Defense Department's war
machine, then you have failed,
because as Magsaysay learned
physical force is not the answer.
Where better to turn than to the
one area where the greatest single
group of talent to answer your
problems is available, i.e., the
college campus. Wars are not
begun because people are
knowledgeable; they are begun
through ignorance.
Peace with USSR
In the last fifteen or twenty
years we have learned to live in
peace with the Soviet Union. We
have not maintained this Peace,
such as it is, through the wisdom
of the McCarthys or the others
who would have us burying our
head in the sand. The students on
this campus today are the
benefactors of those professors
who stood up and told McCarthy,
et al, what it was really all about.
But the strange thing to me is that
those same students are the ones
who are telling professors, "you
have gone far enough now, and
you were right in the 1950s to
stand up to McCarthy, but you
must stop your inquiry now
because it is morally wrong, i.e.,
you must not stand up against us
because we, unlike McCarthy,
have the correct moral prospective
in this area."
Obviously, this is an
oversimplified analogy, but it

appears to me that it raises some
questions that have not been
answered, and I just hope that it
will make some students stop and
re-evaluate their positions. I think
that there are many pressing
problems facing this country at
the present time, and it is good
for the student to be involved.
But I think that students should
examine where and how they are
going, and realize that without the
knowledge necessary to
accomplish the task, they are
doomed to failure.
Knowledge is not gained by
drawing up some vague moral
standard, and saying , "Here is the
line, if you cross it, you may fall
off the edge, but just to make sure
you don't fall off and hurt
yourself, we are going to sit here
in front of you and protect you
from your own inquisitive
nature." Knowledge is gained
through inquiry, research and
hard work. It is strange to see the
student attack inquiry; when what
he wants to attack is the use of
that knowledge.

I'm afraid I don't have any
simple answer to that dilemma,
but I end this letter with the
words of Samuel Johnson:
"Integrity without knowledge
is weak and useless, and
knowledge without integrity is
dangerous and dreadful."

In viewing the activities of SDS

evident to me that the rhetoric I
hear now is very similar to what I
was subjected to as an

enlightening the youth of the
nation in what we have
determined is morally acceptable
subject matter.
Fortunately, professors took
the position that they could not
determine what was morally
wrong with this subject area
unless they examined it very
carefully.
Another Group
Now, the professor finds
himself faced with another
"eniightened" group that has
made another determination as to
what is or is not morally
objectionable. The faculty is now
told to sign this restrictive
research covenant, and then go
out and enlighten your students in
those areas that we have
determined are morally correct.
We have decided that war
related research is not your "bag."
Of course, if we would have paid
some attention to what Mao
Tse-tung and Ramon Magsaysay
have done and said, we might not
be in the mess we presently face
in Vietnam.
Magsaysay found that to
counter-insurgency you had to go
out and find out what the
underlying problems were, and
then work to overcome these
problems, i.e., meet the needs of
the people. President Kennedy in
his second "State of the Union"
message pointed out to the
American people that the real
crux of the problem of
counter-insurgency rested in many
political factors, e.g.,
modernization and reform.
Where do we find the tools to

deal with this problem? Do we
look to the Defense Department?
If the President would have paid a
little more attention to the
research projects coming from this
and other campuses, we might
have been able to prevent what is
now going on in Vietnam.
The problems in Vietnam are
really not military, but they are
basically political, economic,
social, etc. So where do you find
the talent to examine these
problems? If you turn to the
Defense Department's war
machine, then you have failed,
because as Magsaysay learned
physical force is not the answer.
Where better to turn than to the
one area where the greatest single
group of talent to answer your
problems is available, i.e., the
college campus. Wars are not
begun because people are
knowledgeable; they are begun
through ignorance.
Peace with USSR
In the last fifteen or twenty
years we have learned to live in
peace with the Soviet Union. We
have not maintained this Peace,
such as it is, through the wisdom
of the McCarthys or the others
who would have us burying our
head in the sand. The students on
this campus today are the
benefactors of those professors
who stood up and told McCarthy,
et al, what it was really all about.
But the strange thing to me is that
those same students are the ones
who are telling professors, "you
have gone far enough now, and
you were right in the 1950s to
stand up to McCarthy, but you
must stop your inquiry now
because it is morally wrong, i.e.,
you must not stand up against us
because we, unlike McCarthy,
have the correct moral prospective
in this area."
Obviously, this is an
oversimplified analogy, but it

appears to me that it raises some
questions that have not been
answered, and I just hope that it
will make some students stop and
re-evaluate their positions. I think
that there are many pressing
problems facing this country at
the present time, and it is good
for the student to be involved.
But I think that students should
examine where and how they are
going, and realize that without the
knowledge necessary to
accomplish the task, they are
doomed to failure.
Knowledge is not gained by
drawing up some vague moral
standard, and saying , "Here is the
line, if you cross it, you may fall
off the edge, but just to make sure
you don't fall off and hurt
yourself, we are going to sit here
in front of you and protect you
from your own inquisitive
nature." Knowledge is gained
through inquiry, research and
hard work. It is strange to see the
student attack inquiry; when what
he wants to attack is the use of
that knowledge.

I'm afraid I don't have any
simple answer to that dilemma,
but I end this letter with the
words of Samuel Johnson:
"Integrity without knowledge
is weak and useless, and
knowledge without integrity is
dangerous and dreadful."

In viewing the activities of SDS
and other student groups on
campus during the last six or
seven months, it has become
evident to me that the rhetoric I
hear now is very similar to what I
was subjected to as an
undergraduate in the 1950s at the
University of California at
Berkeley.
In those days the faculty was
faced with a little different
problem, i.e., they were told to
sign the special loyalty oath or get
out. This was the day of the
Joseph McCarthy witch hunts,
and professors were being told not
to study communism, etc.,
because the McCarthy followers
had determined that all that type
of research was morally wrong.
Therefore, the professor should
forget about examining such
morally objectionable writings as
the Communist Manifesto, etc.,
and go about his business of
enlightening the youth of the
nation in what we have
determined is morally acceptable
subject matter.
Fortunately, professors took
the position that they could not
determine what was morally
wrong with this subject area
unless they examined it very
