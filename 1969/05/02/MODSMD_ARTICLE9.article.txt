## Clarification Of Statements 
### Dr. Roy C. Amara Dr. Daniel D. Cubicciotti Dr. Dean Parkinson Dr. Lloyd Smith 
We as members of the
professional staff at Stanford
Research Institute protest most
vigorously the remarks attributed
to us by Susan Aimazol in a story
which appeared April 27 under
the heading "SRl's War Role
Minor Says Chief."
Miss Aimazol interviewed each
of us at some length, then selected
phrases and sentences which gave
a grossly inaccurate summary of
what was actually said.
Dr. Amara discussed at length
the democratic process in this
country which, through the ballot
box, expresses national desires
about priorities in the expenditure
of national resources. He, like all
of us, believes change can best be
achieved through this process, and
not by small groups taking illegal
or coercive action. Dr. Amara was
quoted as saying: "You can't
buck the system."
Worried About Priorities
Dr. Cubicciotti expressed his
own worries about national
priorities, his concern over the
end of research, and the difficulty
of predicting how research results
might be used in the future as well
as his opposition to any outside
group overseeing research at SRI.
He was quoted as saying: "I
wanted to do fundamental
research. But you've got to eat.
You've got to do something that
someone will pay for."
While correct in the wording,
Mr. Parkinson's comments were
atrributed to the wrong questions.
He criticized the Scott Committee
report on SRI not for its
references to the cessation of
war-related research but rather for
the committee's callous disregard
for the opinions and welfare of
SRI staff members. He also argued
that it would be impossible for
anyone to intelligently limit
research on the grounds that at
some future date someone might
use the results for immoral
purposes. He also stressed that
any research workers who object
to research projects on moral
grounds should be free to refuse
such work.
Problem Complex
Dr. Lloyd Smith spent more
than 30 minutes discussing with

Miss Aimazol the complexities of
the problem, only to be quoted
out of context in one sentence
saying: "It would be interesting to
know how the nature of research
would be affected if the structure
of funding is changed."
Nowhere in her article did Miss
Aimazol show that each of us
expressed very strongly the
following points of view:
(1) Researchers at SRI are
dedicated people who are doing a
great deal to solve some of the
world's pressing problems. They
are highly moral people who
carefully consider the social
effects of their research. We
believe our moral judgments will
stand comparison with the moral
judgments of any other group;
and we certainly do not intend to
submit ourselves to some outside
"review committee" which would
attempt to pass on the "morality"
of a particular research project

even before it is started.
(2) It is extremely difficult, if
not impossible, to define "morally
objectionable" research. Morality
lies in action, not in knowledge.
We believe that criticism of
certain types of applied research
arises as much from political views
as from moral considerations.
Predicting the eventual use of
research knowledge is equally
impossible. Ten years ago, when
the laser was first developed,
newspapers hailed it as a new
"death ray." We still do not have
a laser "death ray," but the device
has benefitted mankind
enormously in the field of
medicine and in many commercial
applications.
(3) SRI is one of the world's
foremost applied research
organizations. This institution
could be destroyed by
ill-conceived, hastily-contrived
changes in its organizational

structure and relationships. As
members of the professional staff
that built SRI into what it is
today, we do not intend to sit idly
by while irresponsible outsiders
attempt to remold the Institute
closer to their ideal of a "socially
relevant" research tool.
Unfortunately Dr. Lawrence
Pinneo, whose remarks were also
grossly distorted, is out of town
and has not had a chance to see
Miss Almazol's article. Had he
done so, we feel he would agree
with the views expressed in this
letter.
In summation, we all deplore
this distortion of our personal
comments and feel this article was
a gross distortion of the beliefs
generally held by most SRI
professionals. In the interest of
fair play, the Examiner should
print this letter in at least as
prominent a position as was given
to Miss Almazol's story.
