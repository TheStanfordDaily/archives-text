## The 						Big Lie Technique 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
The technique of the big lie
repeated often enough until it is
believed seems to me to be a
standard technique of the April
3rd Movement. SRI is
constinually accused of
performing "counterinsurgency
research in Oakland." This is
based upon a newspaper clipping
from the July 12, 1968, San
Francisco Chronicle which states,
"Researchers from Stanford
Research Institute began
conferring with Oakland police
officials yesterday to try to find
new ways of protecting small
business from robbery, burglary,
and vandalism." This is
counterinsurgency?
This contract resulted from
action of the Congress to find
means for providing insurance to
the small establishments in the
ghetto. Such insurance is not
available commercially these days
and the Federal Government has
been seeking ways in which it
could underwrite the insurance. It
therefore asked the Small Business
Administration to provide it with
the results of a study which would
indicate what steps, if any, the
operators of small business should
be required to take to be
insurable. This included
investigation of such ordinary
steps as the types of locks
provided and the steps to be taken
to minimize the risk of fire. This
is counterinsurgency?
The technique of the big lie is
an old one. It is not an honorable
one.

• Disturbed
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have been very disturbed
today by the reactions of the
Stanford community to the April
3rd Movement's seizures of
Encina Hall. The issues that have
been raised in the past few
months, the same issues that are
listed in the demands of the
Movement, have not changed
overnight—regardless of whether
we agree or disagree with tactics.
Statements by students and
faculty to the effect of their
losing sympathy with the
demands of the Movement due to
their actions Monday morning are
frightening.
Furthermore, the statement of
the Council of President's printed
in yesterday's Daily is responsible.
There is no logically acceptable

reason for yesterday's sit-in to
eliminate or delay any of the
constructive steps that were to be
taken by the Academic Senate on
Thursday, nor to change the
meetings on Thursday and Friday
designed to delve into the
Stanford-SRI problem.
Although it may be difficult, it
is extremely important for each
member of the Stanford
community divorce his feelings on
the tactics used by the Movement
from the substantive issues to be
acted on. These issues—namely
research restrictions at Stanford
and at SRl—have been shown to
be of major concern to the whole
community and should be dealt
with immediately.

• Poem
Editor. THE DAILY:
To Charles Anderson, Songster
Sing no song of plenitude,
of lemmings off to sea,
of marching bands
and shifting sands,
a land that kills to be.
Sing no song of arrogance,
of mercy killers' pride,
of Judas knife
that must bleed life
lest surfeit be denied.
Sing a song, if sing you must,
to liberate the Free,
from ulcered hands
of a fatherland
that showed us not to see.

• The Facts
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to draw attention
again to the facts (as presented in
The Daily, April 29, 1969) about
the "Consensus on SRI" (The

Daily, April 30, 1969):
The student body's
"overwhelming support" of the
position that SRI should be
retained by the University was
68.2 per cent of the 44 per cent
responding to the poll.
The Daily reported: "Both
faculty and students support this
position."
The faculty support of this
position was 35.6 per cent of the
55 per cent who responded.
While these figures show that a
majority of the minority of
registered students responding
were of a consensus, this opinion
clearly does not represent the
faculty position.
When The Daily asserts that
"openness is imperativeat Stanford
(April 30, 1969), I hope it will
keep inmind that openness applied
to all the facts, whether or not
they support your own position.
A "consensus" is a collective
opinion but it is also an
expression of unanimity, which
the result of campus discussion
and opinion is obviously not.
