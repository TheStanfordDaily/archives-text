## A 						Bitter Reversal In Course 
### Gerald T. Snow 
An ironic and bitter reversal
has almost run its course. We have
seen what began—at least, many
of us were willing to believe—as a
movement of sincerely motivated,
idealistic people sacrifice its
morality and integrity, and in
doing so, reveal an extremely ugly
side. In a crucial failure to
perceive the necessity of choosing
tactics of the same moral nature
as the moral ends it professes to
seek, the April 3rd Movement has
foundered in contradictions and
has come to resemble more and
more the kind of thing it claims to
oppose.
In a movement such as the
A3M, by the nature of its ends,
integrity is all-important. It claims
the moral sanctions of being in
the right: it ought therefore to
adopt the tactical position that
right makes might, and not the
converse. It ought to be
long-suffering, as Christ and
Gandhi were. It ought to be

courageous, willing to accept the
consequences of civil
disobedience, as Thoreau was and
Dave Harris was. It ought to love
and not hate. No society yet was
ever redeemed with hate. It ought
to tolerate difference of opinion.
If a tyranny of the majority is
intolerable, what then is a tyranny
of the minority? It must do these
things; otherwise, it remains no
longer true to itself or to its ends.
Pea ce The A ini
If peace is the aim of this
movement, it cannot seek it
through violence—not if it is to be
believed. If the preservation of life
and property is a value to be
upheld, can it be any less so in
one's backyard than in Southeast
Asia? If a person cannot love and
tolerate those nearest to him,
those with whom he lives and
works, it is a pathetic
self-deception on his part to think
that his love and concern for

distant millions is anything more
than an unreal abstraction.
Who's fooling whom, after all?
Some kind of height of hypocrisy
must have been reached the other
night when the A3M's rule of
non-violence was changed to allow
entrance to Encina "by the most
humane means possible." If what
the campus then witnessed is the
best in humanity that the A3M
has to offer, I would say that we
have not yet found an alternative
to what sickens us all in Vietnam.
I am not calling for a return to
a Golden Age. There never was
and never will be one. As one who
remembers Stanford in the early
60's, I would be wrong not to
recognize the many favorable
changes that have come about at
Stanford, at least in part through
the efforts of campus radicals, But
let us pray that some changes will
never come, that the most basic
freedoms of the individual—even
the right to be wrong—will not be

abridged in a precipitous rush to
usher in Utopia tomorrow. If
indeed the winds of greater
freedom and enlightenment have
begun to blow at Stanford in
recent years, it was the hot breath
of hell that visited the campus and
night of Wednesday, April 30.
Take Stock
And now, in the wake of
another crisis, stop! Let us step
out of ourselves for a painful
moment and take stock. The cry
is now for a boycott of classes,
but instead of participating in
more of the same alienated and
alienating responses, why not urge
University to declare a day of
silence, of introspection and
soul-searching, of campus-wide
mourning for the violence we have
done to one another and to our
community—a day of solemn
thought instead of reckless
speech? In addition to a
moratorium on war research, how
about a moratorium on hate?
Until we, whose community this
is, learn to reach out to one
another in love and
understanding, it is vanity to fight
the SRl's and Defense
Departments of this
world—vanity, or worse.
Finally, sadly, the actions of
the April 3rd Movement need to
be overwhelmingly repudiated I
the student body, not in a spirit
of vindictiveness, but simply out
of awareness of what must be
done. The suspensions—apart
from the question of whether or
not those suspended should be
allowed on campus in the
interim—should be ultimately
upheld. The charge by the
Movement of political repression
on the part of the administration
is no more than a red herring. In
the end, what we seek must be the
"victory of reason and the
examined life over unreason and
the tyranny of coercion.

English major—Ed.)
An ironic and bitter reversal
has almost run its course. We have
seen what began—at least, many
of us were willing to believe—as a
movement of sincerely motivated,
idealistic people sacrifice its
morality and integrity, and in
doing so, reveal an extremely ugly
side. In a crucial failure to
perceive the necessity of choosing
tactics of the same moral nature
as the moral ends it professes to
seek, the April 3rd Movement has
foundered in contradictions and
has come to resemble more and
more the kind of thing it claims to
oppose.
In a movement such as the
A3M, by the nature of its ends,
integrity is all-important. It claims
the moral sanctions of being in
the right: it ought therefore to
adopt the tactical position that
right makes might, and not the
converse. It ought to be
long-suffering, as Christ and
Gandhi were. It ought to be

courageous, willing to accept the
consequences of civil
disobedience, as Thoreau was and
Dave Harris was. It ought to love
and not hate. No society yet was
ever redeemed with hate. It ought
to tolerate difference of opinion.
If a tyranny of the majority is
intolerable, what then is a tyranny
of the minority? It must do these
things; otherwise, it remains no
longer true to itself or to its ends.
Pea ce The A ini
If peace is the aim of this
movement, it cannot seek it
through violence—not if it is to be
believed. If the preservation of life
and property is a value to be
upheld, can it be any less so in
one's backyard than in Southeast
Asia? If a person cannot love and
tolerate those nearest to him,
those with whom he lives and
works, it is a pathetic
self-deception on his part to think
that his love and concern for

distant millions is anything more
than an unreal abstraction.
Who's fooling whom, after all?
Some kind of height of hypocrisy
must have been reached the other
night when the A3M's rule of
non-violence was changed to allow
entrance to Encina "by the most
humane means possible." If what
the campus then witnessed is the
best in humanity that the A3M
has to offer, I would say that we
have not yet found an alternative
to what sickens us all in Vietnam.
I am not calling for a return to
a Golden Age. There never was
and never will be one. As one who
remembers Stanford in the early
60's, I would be wrong not to
recognize the many favorable
changes that have come about at
Stanford, at least in part through
the efforts of campus radicals, But
let us pray that some changes will
never come, that the most basic
freedoms of the individual—even
the right to be wrong—will not be

abridged in a precipitous rush to
usher in Utopia tomorrow. If
indeed the winds of greater
freedom and enlightenment have
begun to blow at Stanford in
recent years, it was the hot breath
of hell that visited the campus and
night of Wednesday, April 30.
Take Stock
And now, in the wake of
another crisis, stop! Let us step
out of ourselves for a painful
moment and take stock. The cry
is now for a boycott of classes,
but instead of participating in
more of the same alienated and
alienating responses, why not urge
University to declare a day of
silence, of introspection and
soul-searching, of campus-wide
mourning for the violence we have
done to one another and to our
community—a day of solemn
thought instead of reckless
speech? In addition to a
moratorium on war research, how
about a moratorium on hate?
Until we, whose community this
is, learn to reach out to one
another in love and
understanding, it is vanity to fight
the SRl's and Defense
Departments of this
world—vanity, or worse.
Finally, sadly, the actions of
the April 3rd Movement need to
be overwhelmingly repudiated I
the student body, not in a spirit
of vindictiveness, but simply out
of awareness of what must be
done. The suspensions—apart
from the question of whether or
not those suspended should be
allowed on campus in the
interim—should be ultimately
upheld. The charge by the
Movement of political repression
on the part of the administration
is no more than a red herring. In
the end, what we seek must be the
"victory of reason and the
examined life over unreason and
the tyranny of coercion.
