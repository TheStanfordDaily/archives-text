# Caught In The Middle
## The
						A3M: A Paper Tiger 
### Thomas C. Dawson 
The April 3rd Movement is a
paper tiger.
They talk big about noble goals
such as ending death-dealing
research at Stanford and its
affiliates. They pretend they are
the only ones who possess this
concern. They say they know the
ideal solution to the SRI problem.
Yet they are unwilling to place
either their bodies or their minds
on the line.
Challenged to discuss the fate,
of SRI and classified research in
an open manner (ie, not to
pre-judge the solution) they refuse
and occupy a University building,
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory.
When things are not proceding
to their satisfaction, they forcibly
and violently break into another
University building, Encina Hall.
Yet when they are asked to place
their bodies on the line (when the
police come), they whimper out
claiming they have been betrayed
because everyone who voted to
sit-in didn't. I should think that it
was the principle (SRI) that
mattered and not the numbers of
people they could rally.
If principle does indeed matter,
then why don't they use rational
dialogue (horrors) instead of
swinging fists and kicking feet, the
method of entry into Encina Hall?
The imposition of outside legal
forces on the internal operation of
the University is an outrage. It is
an outrage made necessary by the
violent, forceful occupation of a
University building by certain
militant elements of the April 3rd
Movement. They acted in
complete disregard and contempt
for the internal disciplinary
mechanisms set up by students
and faculty last Spring and
subsequently ratified twice by the
student body, the last time by an
80% margin.
The University took the step
toward calling in outside forces
(both in the form of the police
and the restraining order)
hesitantly and with regret. As
Provost Richard Lyman said to
the Academic Council Thursday,
"No one is entitled to consider
clearing of Encina Hall a victory.
Any time it becomes necessary for
a University to summon the police
a defeat has taken place."
The occupation of Encina Hall
has few supporters outside the
April 3rd Movement and probably
few within the Movement. If the
administration had stopped at the
clearing of the building, perhaps
everyone would be trying to write
off the occupation as an
aberration.
The administration went
further, however. They had the

audacity to try to prevent further
outbreaks like the Encina Hall
occupation. For this they are
being attacked for political
intimidation and supression.
According to President Pitzer,
the court order has two functions:
"to prevent the disruption of
campus activities, or in the event
that this purpose fails, to enable
the University to end the
disruption promptly."
The only really questionable
part of the initial injunction has
now been amended. Paragraph 5,
which prohibited suspended
students from coming on campus,
now prohibits them from entering
classrooms, labs or administration
buildings.
This is not unreasonable,
particularly in view of their
established propensity to disrupt
such facilities. Yet some inequity
lingers on in Paragraph 5. The
paragraph does not prohibit
non-students involved in the
Encina Hall occupation from
entering certain buildings.
So while Steve Weissman, that
veteran of campus insurrections, is
allowed in the Aeronautics and
Astronautics building, Mike
Weinstein, the former LASSU
speaker, is not.
This section of the injunction
should be extended to include all
who were involved in the
ransacking of Encina Hall.
Dealing with the injunction in
more detail, it can be divided into
two parts. The first four
paragraphs merely give the
campus disruptions policy some
real teeth. People violating it are
subject to fines and
imprisonment. In light of recent
events, this is not unreasonable.
The University, or any other
community, cannot permit small
groups to install themselves as
exclusive moral adjudicators.
Paragraph 5, already discussed
in part, is an extreme measure. It
is a necessary one. The history of
the April 3rd Movement shows a
total lack of cooperation with the
internal judicial procedures of the
University.
There is no reason to believe
these particular members of the
Movement will be any more
cooperative with temporary
suspensions imposed against them.
If they intend to continue
ignoring the Stanford Judicial
Council, and their refusal to
identify themselves to Dean Smith
Thursday morning hints they do,
they should not be allowed in
campus buildings. Perhaps they
shouldn't be allowed on campus.
Members of the Stanford

community accept an obligation
to follow procedures set up by the
community (in this case, the
students, faculty and
administration). If they do not
accept this obligation, they have
no right to remain on campus.
It is significant to note that 1
twenty per cent of this column is
devoted to a discussion of
principles and the remaining
eighty per cent to tactics. This is
what the Movement has done to
dialogue at Stanford.
