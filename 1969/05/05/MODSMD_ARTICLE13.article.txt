# Notes From Cornell
## 
### 
I am sending this letter to correct some of the inaccurate reports
concerning recent events on the Cornell University campus.
Background: By minor demonstrations in December: The
Afro-American Society manifested their dissatisfaction with what they
felt to be the slow progress of the committee formed to lay the
foundation of a Black Studies Program. Six blacks were charged with
misconduct and were asked to appear before a judicial board. They
refused, challenging the Board's judicial legitimacy. At a Faculty
Meeting on March 12, it was decided that the board could try the cases.
On Thursday, April 17th, the board rendered reprimands to three of
the students. The Society continued to question the legitimacy of this
board.
Tension arose over harassment of the blacks and heightened when a
cross was burned on the porch of the Black Women's Cooperative.
In an attempt to have their dissatisfaction with both Black Studies
Committee and the judicial board recognized, and partly in response to
the cross-burning, unarmed black students entered Willard Straight Hall
early Saturday morning. A group led by the Students for Democratic
Society formed around the Hall offering protection and support for the
students inside. On Saturday afternoon, threats and a forced entry by
whites (involving a minor scuffle) resulted in a feeling on the part of the
blacks that their safety was imperiled, and they introduced arms for
self-defense. On Sunday, April 20th, administration officials and the
AAS reached an agreement, and the occupation of the building ended.
On Monday, President Perkins announced that bearing of arms or
seizure of a University building would result in suspension or arrest.
That afternoon a faculty meeting was called to consider nullifying the
reprimands previously given by the judicial board. The faculty decided
against nullifying them at that time.
On Tuesday, the AAS called for a reversal of the faculty decision by
9:00 p.m.; otherwise further action would be taken. A number of
faculty pledged non-violent support. That evening, 5000 students met
in support of the AAS. In an atmosphere stressing non-violence they
decided to remain in Barton Hall (a large gymnasium) to support the
AAS and discuss the issues and to await faculty action expected the
next day. 2,500 people remaine'd overnight and voted to underscore
their support by calling their action a "seizure" despite the University's
permission to remain in the building. There was open access to the
building.
The next morning, many students left to discuss the issues with their
professors. At 1:30 p.m., an estimated 10,000 persons met for a
teach-in at Barton Hall. The faculty announced its decision to rescind
the reprimands and to re-evaluate the judicial system. President Perkins
and others addressed the Barton Hall assembly.
As a direct result, concrete proposals for restructuring the University
are being considered and discussions on racism, academic freedom, and
the role of the University in our society are being held, The
Afro-American Society has announced that its guns have been removed
from campus, and they have opened their buildings to inspection. Other
students have removed weapons from their buildings. Most classes have
been resumed.
This is the situation at Cornell. John Kimberly
