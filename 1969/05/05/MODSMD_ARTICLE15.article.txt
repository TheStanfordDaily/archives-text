## A 						Proposal For Orderly Change 
### Forrest R. Frank 
It is apparent to all of us that
the situation on campus is no
longer tolerable. The Community
of the Right has deplored both
the tactics and the demands of the
April 3 Movement, the
Community of the Middle has
deplored some of the tactics of
the April 3 Movement and has
conveyed its "profound" concern
over the issues raised by the
Movement. The Community of
the Left has deplored the lack of
visible action on the demands on
the part of the faculty and

Trustees. All of us agree that the
situation is really pretty bad, the
only question is what should the
community do to alleviate the
problems.
I would like to make the
following proposal. It has
tremendous weaknesses which are
abundantly clear to everyone.
Nonetheless, if we desire effective,
long run change, I believe we must
move in a deliberate pace. Change
must come and will come. It may
come slowly and with violence, or
it may come quickly and orderly.

I propose that we pursue the
latter course.
If consensus exists on any one
issue right now, it is that the Scott
Committee did not really do a
satisfactory job. The inherent
weaknesses of the Scott
Committee doomed it from the
very beginning. The Scott
Committee and the April 3
Movement have raised important
issues, which I think most of us
will agree, insufficient
information is available to all
members of the Community. I

therefore suggest that we adopt
the following proposal:
A new Stanford
University—Stanford Research
Institute Relationship Committee
be established. The membership
on the new committee shall be the
following:
Four employees of the
Stanford Research Institute, at
least three of whom shall hold
non-managerial positions in the
Institute, all of whom to be
elected by secret ballot from the
employees of SRI;
Two Trustees of Stanford
University who are not members
of the Stanford Research Institute
Board of Directors;
One Trustee of Stanford
University who is a member of the
Stanford Research Institute Board
of Directors;
Four students of Stanford
University to be elected in a
manner deemed appropriate by
the Student Legislature;
Four faculty members of
Stanford University to be elected
from the Academic Council in a
manner deemed appropriate by
that body;
The Vice-Provost of Stanford
University.
Fundamentals
The Board of Trustees of
Stanford University shall
authorize the expenditure of
dollars and the Board of
Directors of Stanford Research
Institute shall authorize the
expenditure of — — — — — —
dollars to facilitate field trips,
gathering of testimony from all
parties involved, meet facility
rental costs, and handle the costs
of printing reports.
The proposed committee shall
be given institutional supeonea
power to secure testimony from
witnesses and obtain documents it
deems necessary to the
committee's study.
Noncompliance with a supeonea
order shall be grounds for
prosecution as a violation of the
Fundamental Standard of the
University and/or similar internal
disciplinary action.
Pending the final report of the
Committee and decision by the
Board of Trustees, the following
rules governing research activity at
both Stanford University and
Stanford Research Insittute shall
be in effect:
1. All present research now in
progress at Stanford Research
Institute and/or Stanford
University in ..categories of
Chemical and Biologial Warfare or
Counter Insurgency as defined by
the Joint Chiefs of Staff,
Dictionary of Military Terms for
Joint Usage, 1964. (Joint Chiefs
of Staff, Washington, D.C.) cease.
2. That where contractual
obligations prevent immediate
cessation, every effort be made to
the satisfaction of the Committee
to shift that work to other
institutions and/or withdraw from
contractual obligations.
3. That no new proposals be
'ther submitted for consideration

or accepted in the areas defined in
(1) above.
4. That in the case of
proposals already submitted to an
agency for consideration, those
proposals are to be recalled, or if
unable to do so, no contract on
such proposals are to be accepted.
If a proposal is submitted that
presents a question of definition,
that proposal shall be submitted
first to the Committee,to insure
that the temporary research
limitations are adhered to.
Open Hearings
The Committee shall meet over
the period commencing upon
adoption of this proposal until
one week prior to the October,
1969, meeting of the Stanford
University Board of Trustees. The
Committee shall hold such open
hearings as it deems necessary,
except that during the month of
October, 1969, it shall hold at
least one open hearing per
calendar week prior to submission
of a preliminary report. The
Committee shall hold open
hearings during the month of
November, 1969, up to
submission of the final report one
week prior to the November,
1969, meeting of the Board of
Trustees.
The Board of Trustees upon
receipt of the preliminary shall
hold open hearings at which time
a quorum of the Board shall be
present. These hearings shall be
held at least once a week for a
period of at least three hours. The
Board of Trustees shall make a
final decision on the relationship
of SRI to Stanford University at
its November, 1969, meeting, at
which time, the Board shall
submit that decision to a
referendum of the employees of
SRI as well as the students,
faculty, and staff of Stanford
University.
If the decision of the Trustees
does not receive a majority of the
votes cast, the Board shall
reconsider its action and submit a
new decision to a similar
referendum. If after the second
referendum, the Board has been
unable to gain support of a
majority of the community
casting ballots, the Board shall
consult with members of the
community and reach another
decision which will not be subject
to referendum.
I realize this puts off the
decision on SRI until next year,
and I regret the necessity of
making such a suggestion. But it
seems to me that if this University
is to survive in any form we had
all best take one step backwards,
together, so that we may all go
two steps forward.
I urge that the Community of
Stanford accept this compromise
proposal with all do haste so that
we may once again return to a
discussion of the issues of
Chemical and Biological Warfare
Research, Counterinsurgency, and
Classified Research in institutions
of learning.
