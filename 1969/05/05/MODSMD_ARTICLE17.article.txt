# The 						Movement
## Where Do We Go From Here?

Where do we go from here?
In a solid month of struggle,
the April 3rd Movement has these
achievements:
A ban on secret research at
Stanford.
A halt to new chemical
biological warfare research at SRI.
A quiet faculty revolt against
the Baxter Committee on
Research Policy.
A growing awareness on
campus of the illegitimacy of the
Board of Trustees.
At first glance, this seems like a
formidable list. But it is scarcely a
beginning if we remember the
magnitude of our task. The
original name of the April 3rd
Movement was "SRI Coalition,"
and SRl's military activities in
Southeast Asia have always been
the most urgent problem facing
the Movement.
SRI is the big one. The
sprawling research complex is the
institutional embodiment of the
corruption of America's
technological goals. As Ken Pitzer
told the Trustees last month,
"You are being asked through
your decision on SRI to say that
our national priorities are
wrong—that we spend too much
on the military, on means to kill
people, and not enough on
constructive things, on helping
ordinary people to live."
Faculty Passes Buck
The struggle to keep SRI is not
going well. On Friday, the
Academic Senate shattered any
hopes that the faculty would
block the drive to sever SRI. After
three long meetings—more than
15 hours total—the Senate would
make no recommendation on the
future of SRI. It asked only that
the Trustees hold off a final
decision until fall. A mild
resolution passed against CBW,
but not a word on
counterinsurgency.
Just a day after the faculty
passed the buck, the
Establishment let it be known
that it had its own ideas about
SRl's future. The word came from
none other than David Packard,
former Stanford Trustee and SRI
director, on temporary
reassignment to the Defense
Department. Packard told the San

Francisco Chronicle that "the
solution at Stanford would be for
SRI to adopt a more independent
status."
Unless the Movement can
develop a new strategy, Packard is
certain to have his way. Only one
important group remains unheard
on the question of severance—the
SRI employees themselves. *A
convincing argument must be
made that blocking severance is in
their interests, too.
For months, the SRI
management has tried to keep the
SRI staff ignorant of the
Movement's goals, and to exploit
irrational fears of an "outside
morals committee" which would
pass judgment on research
contracts. The management has
jealously attempted to
monopolize communication
between the staff and the outside
world. Only last Wednesday, SRI
responded to an invitation for
"staff" to testify at the Trustees'
hearing by sending five top
executives, instead of
representative research personnel.
The Movement's past attempts
to talk with individual SRI staff
have been promising. But the
pressure of other business has
kept limited this work. Now it
must have top priority. A splendid
opportunity will be today at
noon, when SRI employees are
invited to have lunch with us at
Burgess Park, adjacent to SRI.
The first task today will be to
dispell the lie that the Movement
wants to foist something on the
SRI staff. It should be emphasized
that any SRI research policy
group should draw most of its
members from rank and file SRI
employees, not from the outside.
Moreover, SRI staff should
recognize that they already have
an elite, non-representative group
that channels their
research — n a m e 1 y , SRI
management. It is SRI
management that determines
whether SRI finds contracts to
save our ecological balance or
contracts to defoliate Vietnam. As
SRI President Charles Anderson
told the Academic Senate, "There
is already internal guidance at SRI
on research projects . . ."

Although it sounds incredible,
the SRI professional staff of
1,5 00 has no representative
government. Control comes from
the top down.
Recently SRI management
tried to squelch attempts by staff
to form a representative body,
and then set up its own
"Kindermann Committee" to
"study" the problem. In the near
future, the Kinderman Committee
is expected to recommend some
token advisory body.
We must convince the SRI staff
that they need more than token
self-government. Why should an
elitist management make research
policy for SRI? We have seen the
result—s6.2s million of death
research in Southeast Asia.
The punch line is this: if SRI is
severed from the University, the
staff will lose their chance to gain
representative government.
Already, the Academic Senate has
come out in favor of an elected
body at SRI, but only if ties to
the University continue.
After years of management
thought-control and co-optation,
we cannot expect the SRI staff to
immediately embrace these ideas.
But a start must be made. SRI is
the big one.
