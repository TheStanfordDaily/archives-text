# Former Governor Speaks
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
Former California governor,
Edmund G. "Pat" Brown, as
confident and brassy as he was
during his eight years as governor
of California, still sees himself as
"the only one who can save the
state of California." The
ex-governor adds with a wry smile,
however, that he sees "no great
demand for my return to public
office."
The raspy-voiced politician
spoke before a crowd of about 75

last week in Tresidder on every
political issue in California from
Sirhan Sirhan to the plight of
Californians at the hands of
Ronald Reagan.
On the Sirhan ease, the former
governor said, "I'd commute his
sentence to life in prison just like
that," snapping his fingers. When

asked about lluey Newton, the
governor evaded the question
somewhat, but did say that
"ordinarily, he would be
permitted to go free on appeal."
Fire Maker
Brown had few good words for
California Governor Reagan,
especially in talking of his

treatment ol campus disorders.
"Ronald Reagan is playing a
strong part in what goes on in this
state, Brown said. "I think
Reagan has poured gasoline on a
the with his threats towards the
California campuses.
"I d give the vote to the
19-year-old," Brown continued,
"But how much authority the
students should have on campus, I
just don t know. You (students)
know what's wrong, but you
don't know what's right."
"As long as Reagan takes a
tough stand on the campus crisis,
he will be popular," Brown
observed. But he added, "Where
there is a violation of the law and
the governor is called upon for
assistance, he must answer."
Issue Round-Up
Speaking from a small note
card, the e;c-governor made the
rounds ol the issues, both local
and national.
On President Nixon: "In 1962,
I thought 1 was a better man. But
now Nixon is President and I'm
defeated."
On politics: "Politics is
dynamic. Get into politics; there
is nothing like it."
On ABM: "We can't do it all."
On the San Francisco Bay: "I
want to protect our bay from the
spoilers who will try to make
money on it."
Brown's "we can reason
together" approach was summed
up by the remark, "The great
problem of government is to get
enough money for what has to be
done." Whether that is the great
problem in government or not was
never mentioned.
"The intelligent people in the
state of California will take
intelligent candidates in the
future, they are not going to take
any Reagan's or Rafferty's,"
Brown concluded.
