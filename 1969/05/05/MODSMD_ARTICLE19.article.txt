# Research Grant Given To Build Microscope

NB:W YORK-The John A.
Hartford Foundation, Inc., has
awarded a two-year, $169,552
research grant to Stanford
University for studies aimed at
building an acoustic microscope
using ultra-high frequency sound
waves instead of light or
electromagnetic waves for
imaging.
Prof. Marvin Chodorow and
Dr. Bertram A. Auld of Stanford's
Microwave Laboratory, the
principal investigators, declared
that such a microscope would

have a "major impact" on
biological and medical research.
"In particular," they said, "one
could avoid the destruction of
cells by electrons in the electron
microscope, or by the staining
techniques required for optical
microscopes. Therefore one could
look at living cells and observe
their behavior under the action of
various stimulants, which is not
possible with conventional
instruments."
Techniques employing
ultrasonic waves to study living
structures are already in use, they
pointed out, but the smallest
wavelengths used are a tenth of a
millimeter long. This allows
imaging only of fairly large
portions of bones, tumors, and
similar subjects.
The Stanford investigators
expect to use wavelengths of less
than three thousandths of a
millimeter, comparable to those
of light. Thus it could "see" the
same size objects as an optical
microscope.
The Stanford scientists believe
that the acoustic microscope
could be made as much as 10,000
times more sensitive to structural
details than the optical
microscope.
