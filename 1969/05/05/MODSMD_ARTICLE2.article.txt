# Senate Passes Resolution Favoring More SRI Study
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
After three long meetings on SRI,
the Academic Senate adopted on Friday
a carefully phrased 300-word resolution
that calls for:
• Further study of alternatives for
SRl's future;
• A "tentative or preliminary"
decision by the Board of Trustees "as
promptly as possible," with no "final
decision or commitment to action"
before Fall quarter;
• Participation by SRI professional
staff in establishing research policy, if
Stanford keeps SRI; and
• Elimination of chemical-biological
warfare research at SRI.
The resolution does not favor any
specific solution to the SRI controversy,
which has been the key issue in the past
month of turmoil on the Stanford
campus. But the resolution names
explicitly only those alternatives on SRI
which involve severance from the
University. The crucial sentence reads,
"The Senate suggests that the
President consider recommending to the
Board of Trustees further detailed
exploration, with professional assistance
and with the participation of the SRI
professional staff, of a number of
alternate possibilities: sale of SRI,
participation in the purchase by SRI
employees, the feasibility of research
limitations as part of the terms of sale,
and the feasibility of other possible
alternatives."
Overtures to SRI Staff
The Senate's resolution makes several
overtures to the 1,500 professional
research staff at SRI, who have thus far
received no representation in the SRI
debate other than that provided by SRI
President Charles Anderson and other
top executives.
"In the event that ties between
Stanford and SRI continue," says the
resolution, "the Senate believes that
determination of research policy at SRI
should involve active participation of
the research personnel of the Institute.
"Establishment of procedures to this
end at SRI would greatly facilitate
development of an appropriate
relationship between Stanford and SRI
and of new research policies at the
Institute."
The Senate went on to suggest
formation of a joint "conference
committee" on research policy by the
Senate and "elected representatives" of
SRl's professional staff.
A Senate member emphasized that
the resolution means the Senate is ready
to form the joint conference committee
immediately, in advance of any Trustee
decision.
At the Friday meeting, the Senate
voted approximately 24-16 to
''postpone indefinitely" the
consideration of a resolution against
military counterinsurgency at SRI.

The proposed resolution, drawn up
by a group of Senators and introduced
by history Prof. Philip Dawson ,and
seconded by biology Prof. Donald
Kennedy, would ban "investigations
that specifically assist efforts and
operations to suppress groups of citizens
by armed force or to provide military
aid to one side in a civil war." The
proposal avoids using the word
"counterinsurgency," and acknowledges
the difficulty of too precise a definition.
After the meeting, several Senators
said they were hopeful that the
counterinsurgency resolution would
come up again. "We're not through with
our consideration of this matter," said
one.
The section of the Senate's final
resolution on the timing of the Trustees
decision was called "confusing" by
another Senator. It asks for a tentative
decision as soon as possible, presumably
at the May 13 Board meeting, but also
urges no final decision until fall quarter,
because of "the complexity of the issues
as well as the level of concern in the
community."
For the last month, the Senate has
been under pressure from the April 3rd
Movement and other groups to come
out against sale of SRI. Besides

advocating an end to secret, CBW,
counterinsurgency and other war-related
research at SRI, the Movement has
proposed a closer relationship with the
University and an emphasis on "socially
constructive" research.
A six-month study by the
Stanford-SRI Committee, cnaired by
law Prof. Kenneth Scott, favored sale of
SRI. One majority statement proposed a
covenant on the sale restricting
"morally objectionable research," while
another statement advocated outright
sale for the largest possible price. A
minority statement endorsed the April
3rd Movement's stand.
The Senate received the Scott
committee report on April 17, and
heard testimony from SRI President
Charles Anderson and members of the
Scott Committee.
In a five-hour meeting April 28, the
Senate went into a confidential
Committee of the Whole and worked
out a first draft of the resolution,
sentence by sentence.
A final version of the resolution was
drafted by the Senate's Steering
Committee and presented at the Friday
meeting. It was accepted with minor
changes.
