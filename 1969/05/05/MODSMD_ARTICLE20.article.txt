# This Week's Campus Films
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Some of the best films of
Orson Welles, Fritz Lang,
Federico Fellini and Satyajit Ray
grace this week's movie calendar.
Fritz Lang's evocative thriller,
M, is the final German classic in
Tresidder's Monday night series.
This 1932 production, Lang's first
with sound, offers a brilliant
performance by Peter Lorre as a
psychopathic murderer caught in
the web of underground criminal
intrigue.
Orson Welles' last American
film. Touch of Evil was ignored
upon its release in 1958, though it
won the Best Picture award at the
Brussels World's Fair, but it is
now being discovered by
enthusiastic audiences at art
houses, college campuses and
otiier places of ill-repute. The plot
is of secondary interest, but
Welles' flair for mood, camera
movement and the baroque is as
evident here as in any of his other
pictures, the opening shot
(partially obscured behind the
titles) being perhaps the most
extraordinary tracking shot in
memory. The cast includes
Marlene Dietrich, Charlton
Heston, Janet Leigh, Joseph
Cotten, Akim Tamiroff and, of
course, Welles himself. You can
see it in Geology 320 on Tuesday
at 8 or 10.
The Western Civ film in
Cubberley on Tuesday and
Wednesday at 4:15 and 7:30 is
Peter Watkins' The War Game.
Regarded by British critic
Kenneth Tynan as "possibly the
most important film ever made,"
this simulated documentary is an
account of a ghastly nuclear
holocaust in London. Made for
the BBC, the film was then denied
broadcast due to its vividness.
Academy Award Winner.
The Cranes Are Flying is one
of the major works of the Russian
cinema, one of the first produced
in the relative freedom after
de-Stalinization began. Dealing
with two lovers caught amidst the
drama of the Second World War,
this week's I-Center film will be
shown in Physics Tank at 8:15 on
Thursday evening.
The Organizer, to be shown
Thursday in Cubberley at 8:15, is
a powerful study of an industrial

workers' strike in Italy at the turn
of the century. Marcello
Mastroianni is superb as the
pivotal character in the rebellion,
the intellectual turned organizer.
Fellini's La Strada is a
magnificent film, being at once a
complex parable and a summation
of the Italian neo-realist
movement. The unique
performances of Giulietta Masina,
Anthony Quinn and Richard
Basehart add to the haunting
mood of the picture, which won
the Academy Award for Best
Foreign Film in 1956. In
Cubberley on Friday night.
Father Panchali, the first
segment of Satyajit Ray's The
Apu Trilogy, will be shown at
Tresidder on Friday night, with
the remaining two parts to follow
in the coming weeks. Patience is
needed, especially with this
episode, but the experience of the
entire trilogy is rewarding, for it
presents a detailed study of a

youth growing into manhood in
India's vast middle class and since
India is rarely heard from
artistically as a country. Ravi
Shankar has provided a rich
musical score.
The Lady Vanishes is one of
Hitchcock's most intriguing and
perversely humorous films. This
murder mystery about a little old
lady who disappears on a train,
made in England in 1938, features
Michael Redgrave, Margaret
Lockwood, Dame May Whitty,
Paul Lukas and an entertaining
supporting cast. At Tresidder on
Saturday.
Franco Zeffirelli's The Taming
of the Shrew is a boisterous,
beautiful comedy; Shakespeare
performed as it rarely is
elsewhere. As in Romeo and
Juliet, Zeffirelli's eye for period
and detail is impeccable. Burton
and Taylor head the marvellous
cast of this Sunday's flick.
