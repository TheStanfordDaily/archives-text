# Senate Resolution
## 
### 
The Senate of the Academic
Council recognizes that the
Report of the Stanford-SRI
Committee was rendered to the
President of the University to
assist in the formulation of his
recommendations to the Board of
Trustees, and that a final decision
on this matter does not lie within
the jurisdiction of the Senate.
Nevertheless, the actions of the
Board will have a far-reaching
impact on the community, and
therefore the Senate believes it
has a responsibility to advise the
Board on this matter.
The Senate suggests that the
President consider recommending
to the Board of Trustees further
detailed exploration, with
professional assistance and with
the participation of the SRI
professional staff, of a number of
alternate possibilities: sale of SRI,
participation in the purchase by
SRI employees, the feasibility of
research limitations as part of the
terms of sale, and the feasibility
of other possible alternatives. The
Senate further believes it desirable
that at least a tentative or
preliminary decision be reached as
promptly as possible after
consultation with the professional

staff of SRI. However, the Senate
recognizes the complexity of the
issues as well as the level of
concern in the community and
urges that the results of the
further detailed exploration
referred to above be reported in
the Fall Quarter 1969 and that no
linal decision or commitment to
action be made until then.
In the event that ties between
Stanford and SRI continue, the
Senate believes that determination
of research policy at SRI should
involve active participation of the
research personnel of the
Institute. Establishment of
procedures to this end at SRI
would greatly facilitate
development of an appropriate
relationship between Stanford and
SRI and of new research policies
at the Institute. The Senate stands
ready to form, in cooperation
with elected representatives of the
professional research personnel at
SRI, a conference committee to
consider research objectives and
policies at both institutions.
The Senate urges the Board of
Trustees to work with SRl's
professional staff toward the
elimination of any projects
dealing directly with the
development of weapons of
biological or chemical warfare at
SRI.
