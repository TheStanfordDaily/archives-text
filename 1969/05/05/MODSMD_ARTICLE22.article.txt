# Tribe Sweeps Cal In Big Day
## Pac-8 Track Win After Three Years 
### 
His hair blown astray by the gusty winds, Randy White pulled on
his sweats with a satisfied smile. Coach Paytop. Jordan had just
informed him that he needn't add a mile relay leg to his quarter-mile
440, intermediate hurdle double wins. The Tribe has suifucient
reserves to assure an 87-67 upset win over Cal.
It turned out the Indians did not need White as they won the final
relay when Pete Fairchild blazed a 47.9 anchor leg to hold oif
Clarence "Tree" Johnson. This was an event which exemplified the
team effort of a fired-up squad seeking its first conference victory in
three years.
The stadium was overflowing with Indian heroes. Donning war
paint, Rick Tipton added a double of his own in the high hurdles and
the 100 year dash, Fairchild has already won the 880, easily
outkicking highly regarded Jerry Tallon.
Previously, Stanford has pulled off a one-two sweep in steeplechase
with Brook Thomas and Chuck Menz, and had swept the mile behind
Allen Sanford's third straight Big Meet mile triumph.
On the infield, Tom Colby threw the javelin just short of the length
of the football field: 265-8, for a new school and meet mark. For the
second week in a row, T.C. Jones came from behind to take the shot
with a new personal best of 58.1.
Tom Massey overcame step problems to win the triple jump at
48-9 1 /j. And captain Peter Boyce dueled Johnson to a stand off at 6-10
in the high jump, only to lose on misses.
Not all of the key men came away winners. Seconds and thirds
became extremely inportant. Bob Anchondo just nipped Bear Dennis
Barkly at the tape to assure the Tribe's sweep in the mile. Bill Griffith
lunged to important points in the highs as he beat out Cal's Bob
McLennan for second.
Jim Kauffman followed White in the quarter and turned a
predicted Bear sweep into a one-two finish for the Tribe. Duncan
McDonald tried his first mile-two mile double and came away with
four points with a second and a third.
And finally Jim Mallery leaped to a life time best in the triple jump
to place third and record the magic 78th point meaning victory on the
scoreboard.
The frosh followed suit in their 84-67 victory over the Cubs. Mark
Haight set the only meet record as he knocked off White's standard in
the 440 intermediates with a 53.9. Scott Stillinger vaulted to a
seasonal best in the pole vault with a 14-6 effort, and Doug Adams
recorded a personal best 144-6 in the discus.


LAST HOPKâ€”Stanford's amazing
freshman, Paul Cerken of East
Norwalk, Connecticut, was the Tribe's
only remaining player yesterday as lie
went into the finals of the California
State Tennis Championships at Alpine
Hills. Cerken faced Burlingame High
senior Krik Van Dillen in the finals of
the five day tournament, Cerken
slipped past rugged Bob Alloo of Cal to
reach the finals, beating him 2-6, 6-3,
6-2. In their only other meeting, Van
Dillen clobbered Cerken in three sets
for the NorCal class singles title,
Unfortunately for Cerken, Van Dillen
repeated the feat yesterday, winning
the title, 3-6, 6-4, 6-2.
