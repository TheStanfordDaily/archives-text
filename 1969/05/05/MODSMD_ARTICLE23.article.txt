# Indians Roll, 10-4, In Tie With UCLA
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
The tightest race in the
three-year history of Pacific-8
baseball loosened up a bit
Saturday. Stanford and UCLA
both beat their traditional rivals
and are now tied for the Pac-8
lead with nine wins and four
losses. Cal and USC are tied for
the number two spot with 9-5
records.
At the Sunken Diamond on
Saturday Coach Ray Young's
Indians humbled the Cal Bears
with a 10-4 triumph. The big
blows of the afternoon were 1) a
three-run home run by Ron
Shotts in the third, 2) a two-run
homer by Bob Boone in the
fourth, and 3) the wind, a 20
m.p.h. blast which played havoc
with fly balls, chilled fans and
participants alike, and picked up
enough dirt to coat everything in
the park with a inch-thick layer of
dust.
A fourth highlight had to be
the surprising and heartening
emergence of the Tribe's offense.
For the first time in weeks
Stanford looked downright
healthy at the plate. The ten runs
scored equalled the locals' output
for the last five league games, and
the 15 hits collected are virtually
unprecedented.
An indication of what was to
come was perhaps given in
Friday's contest between Stanford
and the San Diego Marines.

Trailing 2-0 going into the ninth,
the Tribe evened the score on a
two run homer by center fielder
Ron Shotts. Shotts, a senior who
hits the ball out of sight when he
connects, was getting his first
starting assignment in some time
and made the most of the
opportunity.
The Indians went on to win the
game in the eleventh on four
straight singles. With two out
catcher Craig Lusiani got his third
hit, then advanced to third on
safeties by Bob Marshall and Jack
Hodges and scored on a single by
right fielder Hank Snider. It was
the fifth hit in six trips for the
left-handed hitting Snider.
It was no surprise, therefore,
when Lusiani, Shotts and Snider
were all in the starting lineup
against Cal. The Indians jumped
all over Cal "ace" Tom McAlone
(whose league-leading 0.28 ERA
was still climbing when last seen n
the third) with one run in the first
and two in the second. Shotts'
blast, a high drive to left which
probably would have gone even
without the wind, contributed
three of the four runs scored in
the fourth, and Boone's clout, a
screamer down the line in left,
wrapped up the scoring for
Stanford except for run number
10 in the eighth.
Phil Keller pitched the first six
innings for the Tribe and got the
win, his fifth against three losses.
Rod Poteete finished up. Left
hander Mike Baldwin pitched the
last five innings for Cal.
