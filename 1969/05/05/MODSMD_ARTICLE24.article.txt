# Sad Rowing Day

### 
An inspired race by the
Stanford frosh crew to win their
race in Saturday's Newport
Regatta was the only bright note
in an otherwise dismal weekend in
the Southland for the Indian
oarsmen.
On Friday, UCLA swept the
Harbach Cup Regatta, defeating
the Stanford varsity, JV, and
frosh crews by seven seconds,
eight seconds, and 1.4 seconds
respectively. In the frosh race, the
yearlings came back from a length
down with 500 meters left to lose
by only three seats, or about
fifteen feet.
Hoping to avenge the UCLA
losses somewhat in the next day's
Newport Regatta, the Indians
again found rough going. Held in
Newport Harbor against a stiff
head wind, the Regatta included
crews from host Orange Coast
College, Loyola, San Diego State,
Long Beach, and UC Irvine.
The frosh started off well by
beating Orange Coast by a length,

but the varsity and JV boats both
lost to shells from Irvine. In the
JV race, the Stanford crew came
back from a length defecit to
Orange Coast to a length ahead,
only to find the Irvine crew three
lengths up on them. They were
able to close the gap, but not
enough.
In the varsity race, UCI took a
quick one-length lead and held it
for 1500 meters before the Tribe
began to move. The lead narrowed
to four seats, then two, then one
at the finish, as the Stanford boat
lost by the smallest of margins.


STILL WlNNlNG—Stanford's Rick Tipton is shown winning against San Jose
State. He continued the act in helping the Tribe down Cal, 87-67.
