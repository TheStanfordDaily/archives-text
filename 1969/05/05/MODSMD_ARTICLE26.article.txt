# Golfers Sweep
## 
### 
Tom Watson and Greg Pitzer
led two days of Stanford golf
success over the weekend as the
Indian linksters systematically
smashed San Jose State on Friday
and Pac-8 foe UCLA on Saturday.
The league victory over the
Bruins was a sweet one for Coach
Bud Finger's men. The visitors fell
19-8, as Pitzer took medalist
honors with a fine score of 73
over the tough Stanford course.
The win over the Spartans did

not count in league, but was bery
enjoyable just the same. It
avenged a 14-13 loss to SJS last
month when the teams met at San
Jose Country Club. This time the
score was 17-10, Stanford.
Top man Watson blazed to a
three-under-par 68 against the
Spartans. He started poorly,
three-putting the fourth hole, and
bogeying several others. The
sophomore regained his touch and
rattled off seven birdies for top
honors.
