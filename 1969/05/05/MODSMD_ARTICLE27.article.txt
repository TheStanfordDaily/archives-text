# Austrian Bank Pres. Guest Speaker Today
## 
### 
Dr. Wolfgang Schmitz,
President of the Nationalbank, the
central bank of Austria, will speak
in Tresidder room 281, at 4:15
today. His visit is being sponsored
by the Overseas Campuses Office.
Dr. Schmitz, 45, was appointed
President of the Nationalbank in
early 1968 after having served for
two years as Austria's youngest
Minister of Finance. An
economist of note and active in a
number of professional
associations, he is a champion of
free enterprise and of Catholic
social philosophy.
Dr. Schmitz studied law and
economics at Catholic University
in Washington, D.C., and at the
University of Vienna, where he
earned his doctorate in 1948.
In 1953, Dr. Schmitz was put
in charge of organizing the

Congress of the International
Chamber of Commerce. He is
especially proud of his role as a
co-founder of the Advisory
Council on Economic and Social
Questions. This council affords
the nation's economists an
opportunity to influence the
course of the economy.
A hiker, mountain climber, and
world traveler, Dr. Schmitz is also
a lover of classical music. He is a
sought-after speaker on economic
questions, although he is hardly a
practitioner of grassroots politics.
He describes himself as an
"egghead" and a braintruster.
When the conversation turns to
finance, he usually pulls out a
small slide rule to demonstrate his
point. Even as chief of the
Finance Ministry, he considered
himself a technician, an expert,
rather than a politician.
