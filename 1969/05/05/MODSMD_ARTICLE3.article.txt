# David Packard:
## Sever SRI 
### 
A solution to the present SRI crisis
would be "a more independent status,"
according to Undersecretary of Defense
David Packard.
In his interview with Michael Harris
in Saturday's"San Francisco Chronicle,"
Packard, former chairman of the Board
of Trustees revealed that "it would be
close to disasterous" for SRI to cut
back on classified research.
A member of the Board of Trustees
and of the SRI Board of Directors until
last January, Packard has since placed
300 million dollars in trust to become
second in command of the defense
department. In the course of the
interview, Packard said it was by no
means good for the universities or the
Department of Defense to scale back
their long term cooperation.
The former chairman of the
Hewlett-Packard Co. was questioned
about his view on the SRI crisis here at
Stanford.
He said, "The position of the
(militant) students is that they want to
have Department of Defense research
cut back wherever it is, and they will try
to have SRI brought in under the
faculty. It won't be. It would be
disastrous if it were . . ."

"The hard core bunch is out to
destroy the university. There is a small
group behind all this (who have
attracted) honest young students trying
to find the answers. But the small, hard
core groups—they are the mean ones,"
he said.
Along with advocating areas of
classified research at SRI, Packard went
on to say that the university should
adopt a firm line to bring the campus
back to order.
