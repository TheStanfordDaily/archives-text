# Housing Draw Begins Amid Much Confusion
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Round one of the housing draw,
Stanford's fickle and mysterious
mechanism for placing students in
campus residences, will begin
Wednesday. Unlike last year, all
students wanting to live on campus, not
only those changing residences, must
enter the draw.
Not all students will be able to find
space on campus, as in past years,
according to Assistant Dean of Students
Bob Rosch. But unlike past years,
everyone, except next year's entering
freshmen, will run equal risk of being
evicted from campus residences
regardless of class or sex.
Students who select their present
residence as the first choice must go
through the draw to remain there next
fall. Students will thus run an equal
chance of being evicted, according to
the new rules installed by a
student-faculty draw committee.
Process Of Elimination
Step one in the draw process is
obtaining a draw card from one's
residence director. On it the student

lists in order of preference the code
numbers of his residence choices.
He should then take the card to the
registrar's office in the Old Union on
Wednesday, Thursday, or Friday and
draw a number which is affixed to the
card. This number determines the order
of placement in residences.
Results of the first round will be
returned to residence directions on May
20. Those not assigned to any of their
choices and those who reject their first
round assignment will then enter round
two of the draw.
Students who have not been assigned
by the end of round two will be placed
on waiting lists for their residence
choices. Hopefully they will be placed
as others drop out of the residence
system over the summer.
In order to be placed on as many
waiting lists as possible if necessary,
even students wanting to remain in their
old residences should list alternative
choices.
Present residents who know they will
be moving out of campus housing
should notify their dorm directors.
