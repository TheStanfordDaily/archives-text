# Stanford Lawyers To Test Use Of Restraining Order
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Attorneys for the April 3rd
Movement plan to challenge this
morning the legality of the injunction
and temporary restraining order
obtained by the University last
Thursday in Superior Court. Arguments
will claim that the restraining order is
invalid because it was issued ex parte;
that is, no notice was given that an
order was being sought and no hearing
was held before its issuance.
Richard Kuhns, one of the
Movement's attorneys, commented that
it is not uncommon for ex parte
restraining orders to be issued. He said
that this one would be challenged,
however, because important free speecli
rights may be jeopardized.
Other attorneys for the Movement
are Jim Wolpman, who recently
conducted the successful defense of
persons charged in relation to the
disturbances in Lytton Plaza on
November 6; and Jeff Jennings and
Bruce Kennedy, both teaching fellows
at the Law School.
Attempted Deletion
Friday, the University attempted to
have paragraph five of the temporary
restraining order (TRO) deleted. This
section states that students who are
suspended may not enter the principal
campus of the University during the
period of their suspension other than to
attend meetings of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
The court refused Stanford's request
but Saturday amended paragraph five,
deleting the words "principal campus"
and stated that suspended students may
not enter any classroom, laboratory,
library or other academic building or
any administrative office building of the
University. [The text of the amendment
follows this story. ]
This allows them to remain in
dormitories and use recreational and
auditorium facilities on campus.
Threatened Strike
In other developments, the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) local
1816 sent a letter to President Kenneth
S. Pitzer Friday which protested the
suspension of several members of the
local.
The AFT said, "This injunction
appears to have the effect of
terminating their employment . . . We
must therefore request that you (the
University) negotiate these issues with
this Local immediately. If the
injunction against our members is not
lifted we will be forced to seek strike
sanction from the Santa Clara Labor
Council and the AFT."
In a meeting last night, the Local
passed almost unanimously a statement
that "the union is prepared to strike
unless the issues involving suspension of
our members is resolved quickly."
Three members of the Local have
been suspended to date for their
participation in the sit-in in Encina Hall,
more suspensions are expected.
A general meeting of the Local has
been called for Thursday at 8 p.m. to
discuss the progress of negotiations.
Pitzer's Statement
President Pitzer in a statement issued
late Friday and circulated on campus
Saturday, stated that the purpose of the

injunction is "not punitive; it is not
political; it is not to destroy the April
3rd Movement, or any other movement.
It is intended to prevent the disruption
of campus activities, or in the event that
this purpose fails, to end the disruption
promptly."
He explained that campus judicial
proceedings are still in operation and
that 33 persons were notified by letter
of May 1, that they were immediately
suspended from the University.
One additional person has since been
notified of his suspension bring the total
to 34. Five non-students have been
served with the restraining order
bringing the total number named by the
court to 39.
Further suspensions are expected,
and persons with knowledge of
individuals who were in Encina Hall
have been asked to get in touch with the
President's office.
Pitzer explained why 500 John Does
were listed as defendants saying that it
"enables the order to be used with
dispatch in the event of future
disruption, and enables it to be served
on individuals who are later identified as
having remained in Encina Hall in
violation of the closing order."
• DEPENDENTS' STATEMENT
After a meeting yesterday afternoon
of almost all the named defendants and
their attorneys, the defendants in the
April 3rd Movement issued the
following statement:
As those members of the April 3rd

Movement cited, we wish to make clear
our position on the Temporafy
Restraining Order issued by the Santa
Clara County Superior Court on May
1st.
The April 3rd Movement is involved
in a political, not a judicial struggle. The
University has consistently ignored the
political content and has now chosen to
fight us on essentially irrelevant legal
grounds. Even in this context, however,
the University has attempted to deny us
the basic rights that the legal system
guarantees.
The Restraining Order was issued ex
parte; that is, we were given no notice
that an Order dealing with and
regulating our political speech and
conduct would be sought. No hearing
was held.
On the following day, our attorneys
notified the University's attorneys and
Judge Evans, who had issued the Order,
that any hearings on the Order would
have to be held in open court. This
would allow the defendants to be
present and would guarantee is certain
essential safeguards the right to. present
evidence and argument on our behalf,
and the right to have the entire
proceedings transcribed.
The judge and the attorneys for the
trustees would have none of this.
Instead, Judge Evans sought a private
meeting from which the defendants
would be excluded—only attorneys
would be present. There would be no
written record or open legal procedure.

Judge Evans indicated that unless
our attorneys made themselves
available for such a meeting, he
would feel free to go ahead and
modify his Temporary Restraining
Order unilaterally without
bothering to hold a hearing.
On Sunday morning, May 4th,
we were notified that he had done
just this.
All of this is an appalling
example of the use of backroom
tactics to deprive us of a hearing.
Any attorney can tell you that
private hearings between judge
and counsel, "in chambers" is
where the wheeling and dealing
which never comes to the surface
in the courtroom takes place.
The results of such
machinations are always to the
detriment of justice. Even by legal
standards, the Temporary
Restraining Order fails. Where
political rights such as those
covered by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments are
concerned, the U.S. Supreme
Court has recently ruled on the
use of ex parte proceedings. The
Court has held such proceedings
invalid. (Carroll v. Commissioners

of Princess Anne, 21 L.Ed. 2d
325, 1968). The very illegality of
the Order illustrates the basically
political motive in its issuance. It
is clearly an effort on the part of
the University to channel the
April 3rd Movement's energies
into the courtroom and away
from the political arena.
The Order of the Santa Clara
County Superior Court is invalid
and unjust. We will respect it in
exactly the same manner that
Kenneth Pitzer, the Trustees of
Stanford University, the fancy
San Francisco lawyers, their Law
School consultants, and Judge
Evans respected us when they got
together to cook up this little
abortion.
We will not permit ourselves to
be railroaded by this
unconstitutional legal proceeding:
we demand a full, fair, and open
hearing. Until we get it, we hold
the Court Order in contempt. We
will continue to fight Stanford's
involvement in war research and
to struggle for the demands of the
April 3rd Movement.
• AMI-NDMKNT TO TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDIiR

RESTRAINING ORDIiR
Upon motion of plaintiff, and

Dated May 3, 1 969
Stanley R. Uvans
Judge of the Superior Court
Attorneys for the April 3rd
Movement plan to challenge this
morning the legality of the injunction
and temporary restraining order
obtained by the University last
Thursday in Superior Court. Arguments
will claim that the restraining order is
invalid because it was issued ex parte;
that is, no notice was given that an
order was being sought and no hearing
was held before its issuance.
Richard Kuhns, one of the
Movement's attorneys, commented that
it is not uncommon for ex parte
restraining orders to be issued. He said
that this one would be challenged,
however, because important free speecli
rights may be jeopardized.
Other attorneys for the Movement
are Jim Wolpman, who recently
conducted the successful defense of
persons charged in relation to the
disturbances in Lytton Plaza on
November 6; and Jeff Jennings and
Bruce Kennedy, both teaching fellows
at the Law School.
Attempted Deletion
Friday, the University attempted to
have paragraph five of the temporary
restraining order (TRO) deleted. This
section states that students who are
suspended may not enter the principal
campus of the University during the
period of their suspension other than to
attend meetings of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
The court refused Stanford's request
but Saturday amended paragraph five,
deleting the words "principal campus"
and stated that suspended students may
not enter any classroom, laboratory,
library or other academic building or
any administrative office building of the
University. [The text of the amendment
follows this story. ]
This allows them to remain in
dormitories and use recreational and
auditorium facilities on campus.
Threatened Strike
In other developments, the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) local
1816 sent a letter to President Kenneth
S. Pitzer Friday which protested the
suspension of several members of the
local.
The AFT said, "This injunction
appears to have the effect of
terminating their employment . . . We
must therefore request that you (the
University) negotiate these issues with
this Local immediately. If the
injunction against our members is not
lifted we will be forced to seek strike
sanction from the Santa Clara Labor
Council and the AFT."
In a meeting last night, the Local
passed almost unanimously a statement
that "the union is prepared to strike
unless the issues involving suspension of
our members is resolved quickly."
Three members of the Local have
been suspended to date for their
participation in the sit-in in Encina Hall,
more suspensions are expected.
A general meeting of the Local has
been called for Thursday at 8 p.m. to
discuss the progress of negotiations.
Pitzer's Statement
President Pitzer in a statement issued
late Friday and circulated on campus
Saturday, stated that the purpose of the

injunction is "not punitive; it is not
political; it is not to destroy the April
3rd Movement, or any other movement.
It is intended to prevent the disruption
of campus activities, or in the event that
this purpose fails, to end the disruption
promptly."
He explained that campus judicial
proceedings are still in operation and
that 33 persons were notified by letter
of May 1, that they were immediately
suspended from the University.
One additional person has since been
notified of his suspension bring the total
to 34. Five non-students have been
served with the restraining order
bringing the total number named by the
court to 39.
Further suspensions are expected,
and persons with knowledge of
individuals who were in Encina Hall
have been asked to get in touch with the
President's office.
Pitzer explained why 500 John Does
were listed as defendants saying that it
"enables the order to be used with
dispatch in the event of future
disruption, and enables it to be served
on individuals who are later identified as
having remained in Encina Hall in
violation of the closing order."
• DEPENDENTS' STATEMENT
After a meeting yesterday afternoon
of almost all the named defendants and
their attorneys, the defendants in the
April 3rd Movement issued the
following statement:
As those members of the April 3rd

Movement cited, we wish to make clear
our position on the Temporafy
Restraining Order issued by the Santa
Clara County Superior Court on May
1st.
The April 3rd Movement is involved
in a political, not a judicial struggle. The
University has consistently ignored the
political content and has now chosen to
fight us on essentially irrelevant legal
grounds. Even in this context, however,
the University has attempted to deny us
the basic rights that the legal system
guarantees.
The Restraining Order was issued ex
parte; that is, we were given no notice
that an Order dealing with and
regulating our political speech and
conduct would be sought. No hearing
was held.
On the following day, our attorneys
notified the University's attorneys and
Judge Evans, who had issued the Order,
that any hearings on the Order would
have to be held in open court. This
would allow the defendants to be
present and would guarantee is certain
essential safeguards the right to. present
evidence and argument on our behalf,
and the right to have the entire
proceedings transcribed.
The judge and the attorneys for the
trustees would have none of this.
Instead, Judge Evans sought a private
meeting from which the defendants
would be excluded—only attorneys
would be present. There would be no
written record or open legal procedure.
Judge Evans indicated that unless
our attorneys made themselves
available for such a meeting, he
would feel free to go ahead and
modify his Temporary Restraining
Order unilaterally without
bothering to hold a hearing.
On Sunday morning, May 4th,
we were notified that he had done
just this.
All of this is an appalling
example of the use of backroom
tactics to deprive us of a hearing.
Any attorney can tell you that
private hearings between judge
and counsel, "in chambers" is
where the wheeling and dealing
which never comes to the surface
in the courtroom takes place.
The results of such
machinations are always to the
detriment of justice. Even by legal
standards, the Temporary
Restraining Order fails. Where
political rights such as those
covered by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments are
concerned, the U.S. Supreme
Court has recently ruled on the
use of ex parte proceedings. The
Court has held such proceedings
invalid. (Carroll v. Commissioners

of Princess Anne, 21 L.Ed. 2d
325, 1968). The very illegality of
the Order illustrates the basically
political motive in its issuance. It
is clearly an effort on the part of
the University to channel the
April 3rd Movement's energies

University has consistently ignored the
political content and has now chosen to
fight us on essentially irrelevant legal
grounds. Even in this context, however,
the University has attempted to deny us
the basic rights that the legal system
guarantees.
The Restraining Order was issued ex
parte; that is, we were given no notice
that an Order dealing with and
regulating our political speech and
conduct would be sought. No hearing
was held.
On the following day, our attorneys
notified the University's attorneys and
Judge Evans, who had issued the Order,
that any hearings on the Order would
have to be held in open court. This
would allow the defendants to be
present and would guarantee is certain
essential safeguards the right to. present
evidence and argument on our behalf,
and the right to have the entire
proceedings transcribed.
The judge and the attorneys for the
trustees would have none of this.
Instead, Judge Evans sought a private
meeting from which the defendants
would be excluded—only attorneys
would be present. There would be no
written record or open legal procedure.
Judge Evans indicated that unless
our attorneys made themselves
available for such a meeting, he
would feel free to go ahead and
modify his Temporary Restraining
Order unilaterally without
bothering to hold a hearing.
On Sunday morning, May 4th,
we were notified that he had done
just this.
All of this is an appalling
example of the use of backroom
tactics to deprive us of a hearing.
Any attorney can tell you that
private hearings between judge
and counsel, "in chambers" is
where the wheeling and dealing
which never comes to the surface
in the courtroom takes place.
The results of such
machinations are always to the
detriment of justice. Even by legal
standards, the Temporary
Restraining Order fails. Where
political rights such as those
covered by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments are
concerned, the U.S. Supreme
Court has recently ruled on the
use of ex parte proceedings. The
Court has held such proceedings
invalid. (Carroll v. Commissioners

of Princess Anne, 21 L.Ed. 2d
325, 1968). The very illegality of
the Order illustrates the basically
political motive in its issuance. It
is clearly an effort on the part of
the University to channel the
April 3rd Movement's energies
into the courtroom and away
from the political arena.
The Order of the Santa Clara
County Superior Court is invalid
and unjust. We will respect it in
exactly the same manner that
Kenneth Pitzer, the Trustees of
Stanford University, the fancy
San Francisco lawyers, their Law
School consultants, and Judge
Evans respected us when they got
together to cook up this little
abortion.
We will not permit ourselves to
be railroaded by this
unconstitutional legal proceeding:
we demand a full, fair, and open
hearing. Until we get it, we hold
the Court Order in contempt. We
will continue to fight Stanford's
involvement in war research and

Stanley R. Uvans
Judge of the Superior Court
Attorneys for the April 3rd
Movement plan to challenge this
morning the legality of the injunction
and temporary restraining order
obtained by the University last
Thursday in Superior Court. Arguments
will claim that the restraining order is
invalid because it was issued ex parte;
that is, no notice was given that an
order was being sought and no hearing
was held before its issuance.
Richard Kuhns, one of the
Movement's attorneys, commented that
it is not uncommon for ex parte
restraining orders to be issued. He said
that this one would be challenged,
however, because important free speecli
rights may be jeopardized.
Other attorneys for the Movement
are Jim Wolpman, who recently
conducted the successful defense of
persons charged in relation to the
disturbances in Lytton Plaza on
November 6; and Jeff Jennings and
Bruce Kennedy, both teaching fellows
at the Law School.
Attempted Deletion
Friday, the University attempted to
have paragraph five of the temporary
restraining order (TRO) deleted. This
section states that students who are
suspended may not enter the principal
campus of the University during the
period of their suspension other than to
attend meetings of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
The court refused Stanford's request
but Saturday amended paragraph five,
deleting the words "principal campus"
and stated that suspended students may
not enter any classroom, laboratory,
library or other academic building or
any administrative office building of the
University. [The text of the amendment
follows this story. ]
This allows them to remain in
dormitories and use recreational and
auditorium facilities on campus.
Threatened Strike
In other developments, the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) local
1816 sent a letter to President Kenneth
S. Pitzer Friday which protested the
suspension of several members of the
local.
The AFT said, "This injunction
appears to have the effect of
terminating their employment . . . We
must therefore request that you (the
University) negotiate these issues with
this Local immediately. If the
injunction against our members is not
lifted we will be forced to seek strike
sanction from the Santa Clara Labor
Council and the AFT."
In a meeting last night, the Local
passed almost unanimously a statement
that "the union is prepared to strike
unless the issues involving suspension of
our members is resolved quickly."
Three members of the Local have
been suspended to date for their
participation in the sit-in in Encina Hall,
more suspensions are expected.
A general meeting of the Local has
been called for Thursday at 8 p.m. to
discuss the progress of negotiations.
Pitzer's Statement
President Pitzer in a statement issued
late Friday and circulated on campus
Saturday, stated that the purpose of the

injunction is "not punitive; it is not
political; it is not to destroy the April
3rd Movement, or any other movement.
It is intended to prevent the disruption
of campus activities, or in the event that
this purpose fails, to end the disruption
promptly."
He explained that campus judicial
proceedings are still in operation and
that 33 persons were notified by letter
of May 1, that they were immediately
suspended from the University.
One additional person has since been
notified of his suspension bring the total
to 34. Five non-students have been
served with the restraining order
bringing the total number named by the
court to 39.
Further suspensions are expected,
and persons with knowledge of
individuals who were in Encina Hall
have been asked to get in touch with the
President's office.
Pitzer explained why 500 John Does
were listed as defendants saying that it
"enables the order to be used with
dispatch in the event of future
disruption, and enables it to be served
on individuals who are later identified as
having remained in Encina Hall in
violation of the closing order."

passed almost unanimously a statement
that "the union is prepared to strike
unless the issues involving suspension of
our members is resolved quickly."
Three members of the Local have
been suspended to date for their
participation in the sit-in in Encina Hall,
more suspensions are expected.
A general meeting of the Local has
been called for Thursday at 8 p.m. to
discuss the progress of negotiations.
Pitzer's Statement
President Pitzer in a statement issued
late Friday and circulated on campus
Saturday, stated that the purpose of the

injunction is "not punitive; it is not
political; it is not to destroy the April
3rd Movement, or any other movement.
It is intended to prevent the disruption
of campus activities, or in the event that
this purpose fails, to end the disruption
promptly."
He explained that campus judicial
proceedings are still in operation and
that 33 persons were notified by letter
of May 1, that they were immediately
suspended from the University.
One additional person has since been
notified of his suspension bring the total
to 34. Five non-students have been
served with the restraining order
bringing the total number named by the
court to 39.
Further suspensions are expected,
and persons with knowledge of
individuals who were in Encina Hall
have been asked to get in touch with the
President's office.
Pitzer explained why 500 John Does
were listed as defendants saying that it
"enables the order to be used with
dispatch in the event of future
disruption, and enables it to be served
on individuals who are later identified as
having remained in Encina Hall in
violation of the closing order."
• DEPENDENTS' STATEMENT
After a meeting yesterday afternoon
of almost all the named defendants and
their attorneys, the defendants in the
April 3rd Movement issued the
following statement:
As those members of the April 3rd

Movement cited, we wish to make clear
our position on the Temporafy
Restraining Order issued by the Santa
Clara County Superior Court on May
1st.
The April 3rd Movement is involved
in a political, not a judicial struggle. The
University has consistently ignored the
political content and has now chosen to
fight us on essentially irrelevant legal
grounds. Even in this context, however,
the University has attempted to deny us
the basic rights that the legal system
guarantees.
The Restraining Order was issued ex
parte; that is, we were given no notice
that an Order dealing with and
regulating our political speech and
conduct would be sought. No hearing
was held.
On the following day, our attorneys
notified the University's attorneys and
Judge Evans, who had issued the Order,
that any hearings on the Order would
have to be held in open court. This
would allow the defendants to be
present and would guarantee is certain
essential safeguards the right to. present
evidence and argument on our behalf,
and the right to have the entire
proceedings transcribed.
The judge and the attorneys for the
trustees would have none of this.
Instead, Judge Evans sought a private
meeting from which the defendants
would be excluded—only attorneys
would be present. There would be no
written record or open legal procedure.
Judge Evans indicated that unless
our attorneys made themselves
available for such a meeting, he
would feel free to go ahead and
modify his Temporary Restraining
Order unilaterally without
bothering to hold a hearing.
On Sunday morning, May 4th,
we were notified that he had done
just this.
All of this is an appalling
example of the use of backroom
tactics to deprive us of a hearing.
Any attorney can tell you that
private hearings between judge
and counsel, "in chambers" is
where the wheeling and dealing
which never comes to the surface
in the courtroom takes place.
The results of such
machinations are always to the
detriment of justice. Even by legal
standards, the Temporary
Restraining Order fails. Where
political rights such as those
covered by the First and
Fourteenth Amendments are
concerned, the U.S. Supreme
Court has recently ruled on the
use of ex parte proceedings. The
Court has held such proceedings
invalid. (Carroll v. Commissioners

of Princess Anne, 21 L.Ed. 2d
325, 1968). The very illegality of
the Order illustrates the basically
political motive in its issuance. It
is clearly an effort on the part of
the University to channel the
April 3rd Movement's energies
into the courtroom and away
from the political arena.
The Order of the Santa Clara
County Superior Court is invalid
and unjust. We will respect it in
exactly the same manner that
Kenneth Pitzer, the Trustees of
Stanford University, the fancy
San Francisco lawyers, their Law
School consultants, and Judge
Evans respected us when they got
together to cook up this little
abortion.
We will not permit ourselves to
be railroaded by this
unconstitutional legal proceeding:
we demand a full, fair, and open
hearing. Until we get it, we hold
the Court Order in contempt. We
will continue to fight Stanford's
involvement in war research and
to struggle for the demands of the
April 3rd Movement.
• AMI-NDMKNT TO TEMPORARY
RESTRAINING ORDIiR
Upon motion of plaintiff, and
it appearing that it is necessary for
the continued orderly conduct of
the activities of Stanford
University that paragraph 5 of the
Temporary Restraining Order
issued May 1, 1969, be amended,
IT IS HEREBY ORDERED
that paragraph 5 of said
Temporary Restraining Order be
amended to read as follows:
5. In the case of those
defendants who have been
suspended as students of Stanford
University, from entering any
classroom, laboratory, library or
other academic building or any
administrative office building of
Stanford University during the
period of their suspension other
than to attend meetings of the
Judicial Council of the University.
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED
that plaintiff shall make
reasonable and prompt efforts to
provide copies of this amendment
to all persons heretofore served
with said Temporary Restraining
Order; and
IT IS FURTHER ORDERED
that said Temporary Restraining
Order, except as herein amended,
and the Order to Show Cause
issued therewith, shall remain in
full force and effect as therein
provided.
Dated May 3, 1 969
Stanley R. Uvans
Judge of the Superior Court
Attorneys for the April 3rd
Movement plan to challenge this
morning the legality of the injunction
and temporary restraining order
obtained by the University last
Thursday in Superior Court. Arguments
will claim that the restraining order is
invalid because it was issued ex parte;
that is, no notice was given that an
order was being sought and no hearing
was held before its issuance.
Richard Kuhns, one of the
Movement's attorneys, commented that
it is not uncommon for ex parte
restraining orders to be issued. He said
that this one would be challenged,
however, because important free speecli
rights may be jeopardized.
Other attorneys for the Movement
are Jim Wolpman, who recently
conducted the successful defense of
persons charged in relation to the
disturbances in Lytton Plaza on
November 6; and Jeff Jennings and
Bruce Kennedy, both teaching fellows
at the Law School.
Attempted Deletion
Friday, the University attempted to
have paragraph five of the temporary
restraining order (TRO) deleted. This
section states that students who are
suspended may not enter the principal
campus of the University during the
period of their suspension other than to
attend meetings of the Stanford Judicial
Council.
The court refused Stanford's request
but Saturday amended paragraph five,
deleting the words "principal campus"
and stated that suspended students may
not enter any classroom, laboratory,
library or other academic building or
any administrative office building of the
University. [The text of the amendment
follows this story. ]
This allows them to remain in
dormitories and use recreational and
auditorium facilities on campus.
Threatened Strike
In other developments, the American
Federation of Teachers (AFT) local
1816 sent a letter to President Kenneth
S. Pitzer Friday which protested the
suspension of several members of the
local.
The AFT said, "This injunction
appears to have the effect of
terminating their employment . . . We
must therefore request that you (the
University) negotiate these issues with
this Local immediately. If the
injunction against our members is not
lifted we will be forced to seek strike
sanction from the Santa Clara Labor
Council and the AFT."
In a meeting last night, the Local
passed almost unanimously a statement
that "the union is prepared to strike
unless the issues involving suspension of
our members is resolved quickly."
Three members of the Local have
been suspended to date for their
participation in the sit-in in Encina Hall,
more suspensions are expected.
A general meeting of the Local has
been called for Thursday at 8 p.m. to
discuss the progress of negotiations.

on individuals who are later identified as
