# SRI Wants Dialogue; Movement Discusses
## 
### 
Students, faculty, and the staff of
the Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
are invited to a community dialogue at
noon today in Burgess Park next to SRI.
Sponsored by the staff of SRI, the
purpose of the discussion is to take a
"basic step towards establishing a
community dialogue and spirit."
"We must come together," urged a
leaflet put out about the noon meeting.
"If there is hope for a Stanford
community, then we, the people of SRI
and the Stanford faculty and staff, must
lay the ground work for communication
and a sincere understanding of the many
problems involved," the leaflet said.
Transportation to Burgess Park will
be provided from the Old Union
Courtyard at noon.
The April 3rd Movement (A3M) is
holding an additional community
meeting tonight at 7:15 in the Old
Union Courtyard.
Organizational Effort
The ranks of the Movement have
been devoting themselves to a copious
amount of organizational and discussion
meetings since their brief sit-in at
Encina Hall last Wednesday night.
At a noon rally at White Plaza on
Friday, members of the Movement and
other speakers gave their opinions on
the legal and moral ramifications of the
temporary restraining order obtained on
May 1.
Harrison Minge Brown, a graduate

student in physics and son of Stanford
Trustee Robert Minge Brown, told the
White Plaza rally on Friday that the
court injunction obtained by the
University was "encroaching fascism."
Brown described the involvement of
his father's law firm, Brown,
McCutcheon, Doyle, and Enersen in
assisting the University draw up the
injunction as "outrageous."
The principal speaker at the rally was
Doron Weinberg, one of the named
defendants in the action and a teaching
fellow at the Stanford Law School.
Weinberg called the injunction "an
attempt to suppress the free speech" of
those suspended students who are
prohibited from entering the campus.
His comments were followed by
questions from the crowd about various
points of the injunction.
Search For Affinity
John Schoch, who was the rally's
master of ceremonies, announced that
the Movement would spend the
weekend discussing various plans for the
future in small, "affinity" groups.
More than 130 students appeared
later Friday afternoon on the lawn in
front of the law school to "rap" with
one another. The eight or nine affinity
groups that were quickly organized
spent the rest of the afternoon
discussing issues, tactics, personal
hang-ups, and politics.
