# Waxes Emotionalism
## Mary Hanson: Radical In Progress 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Mary Hanson, member of the April
3rd Movement and former Stanford
student, was not a "red diaper baby."
There was a lot of political discussion in
her family, but her mother was only
fairly liberal and her father was
conservative.
Today, Mary is known on campus for
her role as girl-radical-at-Stanford. When
she speaks at an SDS or Movement
meeting, she sometimes waxes
emotional and berates the group for not
examining a particular issue fully.
She is one of the individuals named
last Thursday in the University's action
to halt further disruptive acts on
campus.
Coming from Sturgeon Bay,
Wisconsin, Mary came to Stanford in
1964 and was almost immediately
radicalized. She fell in with a crowd that
she describes as "the New York, Jewish,
English T.A. bunch."
Political Involvement
By 1968, Stanford was not offering
Mary anything very attractive
academically, and she became more and
more involved politically. She left
Stanford for five months to work with
the Radical Education Project in
Michigan where she met radicals from
all over the country.
At the start of the current school
year, Mary returned to Stanford as a
non-student because she liked working
with the radical movement here. She
respects the people in the movement
here because they are "honest and
intelligent about what has to bf done."
Why is it important to take the
radical approach to politics at Stanford?
Mary states that there is a high
concentration of the corporate liberal
system in the surrounding
area â€” specifically the

university-military-industrial complex.
Radicals at Stanford have studied the
situation and have learned how much
influence the local complex has in the
world.
Stanford radicals focus their
attention on the complex's involvement
in Southeast Asia, Latin American and
domestic ghettoes because the Trustees
and their corporations seem to have
their most destructive effects in these
areas, Mary maintains.
Radical's Progress
It is Mary's opinion that the radical
element at Stanford has become much
more unified as the present year has
progressed. The April 3rd meeting in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium was a turning
point because it was actually the first
time the whole community gathered

together to make demands about halting
chemical-biological warfare research and
counterinsurgency and bringing SRI
closer to the University.
"The expression is that the April 3rd
movement did for SDS what SDS had
been trying to do for itself," Mary
observed. "It got people working
together and putting their differences of
opinion into a perspective that didn't
keep us from organizing."
The question of the use of force as i
tactic ties into the issue of attempting
to shut down the university, Mary feels.
Force will be necessary if the radicals
are to obtain their demands. Mary is
unsure as to whether or not the
demands will be obtained by the close
of the year. The possibility of gaining
the demands rests on what the radicals
do and how they do it, according to her.
One thing is certain in Mary's mind:
if the radicals make no moves, there will
be no chance for change. The Trustees
are not going to be influenced on any
other plane, but their vested interests.
Radicals As Teachers
Do Stanford radicals see themselves
as teachers of the unaware mass of
Stanford students?
"At our best, we can talk to people
with open minds and attempt to
politicize them. Sometimes we get
preachy. I know I get preachy," Mary
admitted.
A radical becomes preachy when he
is just rattling off what he feels. Mary
notes that ineffective communication is
one of the big drawbacks of the general
meetings that the April 3rd Movement
has held. Many students come to the
general meetings hoping to be educated
politically, but the meetings often don't
live up to the students' hope.
A more effect ive means of becoming
radicalized is to talk to individuals with

radical sentiments on a one-to-one basis.
Mary sometimes feels the drawbacks of
a large meeting in a very personal way.
She becomes so "up-tight" when she
feels a particularly important issue is
not being effectively communicated
that she can't even express her concern.
How much of a "kick element" is
there to the radical movement at
Stanford?
Stanford radicals take their politics
quite seriously. There is very little, if
any, of the let's-cause-trouble-for-the
fun-of-it aspect to radicals' activities
here. Mary believes that the hours many
radicals spend in political discussion is
evidence of the fact that politics is a
serious business to these people.
Irreverance on the radical's part
appears as callousness to other people.
After listening to faculty and
administration people contend that they
are morally concerned with issues and
then watching them act in the opposite
manner, radicals feel that authority
figures' credibility has worn thin.
If the April 3rd Movement has made
tactical errors, and Mary contends that
they have, most of the fault rests with
the Movement's co-ordinating
committee. The co-ordinating
committee sits around and tries to
decide what people in the general
meetings will want to talk about, and
often they gauge incorrectly.
Presently Mary Hanson is not overly
optimistic about the future of the
radical approach. She is tired and tense
from nights without much sleep and
days wiMi much political activity.
Though she is probably more
"hyper-sensitive" than the onlooker at a
general meeting might guess, Mary is a
girl dedicated to a thoroughgoing
change of the social structure as it
current stands.
