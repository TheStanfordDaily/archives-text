# Reasons Exist

Following three clays of intense
community-wide discussion, Amherst
College sent a most eloquent letter to
Richard Nixon telling him that college
disorder stems from more than the wild
actions of a tiny minority. We support the
Amherst statement and reprint excerpts
below. The words speak to many at Stan
ford as well as the White House.

"We have also as a college embraced a new
sense of urgency of another kind. We believe that
we must speak out to make clear that much of the
turmoil among young people and among those
who arc dedicated to humane and reasoned changes
will continue.
"It will continue until you and the other
political leaders of our country address more
effectively, massively, and persistently the major
social and foreign problems of our society. Part of
this turmoil in universities derives from the dis
tance separating the American dream from the
American reality.
"Institutions dedicated to the nurture, hus
banding, and growth of critical intelligence, and to
inquiry into basic problems cannot but open
people's eyes to the shoddiness of many aspects of
our society.
"In yesterday's New York Times it is reported
that five officers in your Cabinet "seemed to agree
that the disorder was caused by a small minority
of students."
"Our conviction is that such a view is seriously
in error if it is taken to mean that no legitimate
and important reasons exist for the anger and
sense of impotence felt by many students and
faculty.
"The pervasive and insistent disquiet on many
campuses throughout the nation indicates that
unrest results, not from a conspiracy by a few, but
from a shared sense that the nation has no
adequate plans for meeting the crises of our

society. To name only one issue of special concern
to the students: since the Kerner Commission's
report, there lias been no decisive response to its
recommendations.
"We do not say that all the problems faced by
colleges and universities are a reflection of the
malaise of the larger society. That is not true. But
we do say that until political leadership addresses
itself to the major problems of our society-the
huge expenditure of national resources for military
purposes, the inequities practiced by the present
draft system, the critical needs of America's
23,000,000 poor, the unequal division of our life
on racial issues-until this happens, the concern
and energy of those who know the need for
change will seek outlets for their frustration.
"We realize that in writing this letter we have
taken the unusual step of speaking publicly for our
community on pressing issues of the moment. We
do this out of an urgent concern to question the
widely held view that university unrest is merely
an internal problem, or at most fomented by an
outside influence.
"More, we believe that if political leaders act on
this mistaken assumption, their actions will serve
only to widen the separations within the university
and between the universities and society at large.
"If, however, this important element in student
unrest is understood, it would be possible for you,
Mr. President, to redirect youthful energy toward
those more idealistic, creative and generous actions
which reflect a concern for others. Your influence
can provide that hope which encourages those
visions to which young men so gladly dedicate
themselves, and we will support those efforts.
"I send this letter to you on behalf of an
overwhelming majority of Amherst students,
faculty and administration who attended the
closing meeting of our days of inquiry tonight.
Copies of this letter with the signatures of all those
who wish to subscribe will follow as soon as
possible. Calvin Plimpton
President
