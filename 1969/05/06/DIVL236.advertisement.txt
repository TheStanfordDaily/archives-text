Would you pay
a little something to
get through your next
language exam?
At Berlitz, we have a secret device for getting you through
language tests.
It's called a Berlitz instructor.
He's a man who's gotten dozens of seemingly hopeless stu
dents through dozens of seemingly impossible exams.
He does it by first finding out just how hopeless you are, then
he sits with you and virtually brainwashes you until you not
only speak the language. You understand.
Of course, all this costs a dollar or two.
But seeing it could make all the difference between making
it and flunking, it's a small price to pay.
