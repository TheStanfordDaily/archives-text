## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
At least 20 more students who
participated in the Encina sit-in have
been identified and will be suspended in
the near future according to the
administration.
The additional names were obtained
from faculty members who were
observing the sit-in.
Thirtv-four students have already
been suspended and enjoined by
Superior Court order from entering
certain areas of the campus.
The administration also announced
that teaching assistants (TA's) who have
been suspended will continue to receive
full pay but will not be allowed to teach
their classes. Additional TA's will be
hired at the same rate of pay to teach
the classes of the suspended TA's.
Office Entered
Yesterday afternoon one of the April
3rd Movement's "affinity" groups led
by a suspended student entered the
President's office. While conferring with
President Pitzer about the injunction,
the student told Pitzer that he was one
of those suspended. Pitzer then asked
the student to comply with the
injunction and leave the building.
According to Pitzer he did so. The
student says that he left with the entire
group after ten minutes of discussion
with the President.
Under the terms of the restraining
order, a suspended student is enjoined
from entering any classroom,
laboratory, library or other academic
building or any administrative building
of the University.
Violations of the injunction can be
handled in several ways. In civil court
proceedings handled through Superior
Court, the University has the option to
enforce the injunction or not. If they
choose to enforce it, the court orders
the defendant to appear before the
court to show cause why he shouldn't
be held in contempt of court. The court
can then jail, fine or release the
defendant.
In criminal proceedings the district
attorney can issue a warrant for the
defendant's arrest and charge him with
violating a court order. This is a
misdemeanor and would be handled by
municipal court. This can be done
without the Unviersity's participation.
Motion Filed
Three attorneys representing 22 of
the 39 named defendants filed a motion

yesterday morning in Superior Court lo
dissolve the temporary restraining order
obtained by the University Thursday
morning.
The memorandum of points filed
with the motion to dissolve asserts that
the court's order is "fatally" defective
and was void upon issuance. This charge
is based on the claim that it was
obtained e\ parte; that is without
formal or informal notice to the
defendants.
In addition, according to the
defendant's attorneys, a legal defense
organization with a staff, pool of
lawyers, office and telephone was in
operation and its existence was known
to Stanford University.
The judge set May 13 as the date for
hearing the defendant's motion. This is
also the day the defendants or their
attorneys must appear in court to show
cauae why the temporary injunction
should not be made permanent and the
date of the Trustee's meeting in San
Francisco.
Movement Meeting
The Movement held another mass
meeting last night in the Old Union
courtyard. About 150 persons attended.
The session began with talks on four
topics- the Academic Senate's actions,
the choice of Encina Hall, the status of
the injunction, and the possibility of an
AFT strike.
First, the Senate's resolution of last
Friday was blasted as "a cop-out."
Doron Weinberg, suspended Law School
teaching assistant then discussed the
legal action the Movement was taking
against the injunction, and the
circumstances surrounding the
alteration of the clause concerning
suspended students.
Jim Shoch, another suspended
student, explained the reasons for
choosing Encina Hall as the site for last
week's abortive sit-in. "We had to hit at
the trustees' interests," he said.
Trustee's Interests
"We had to make meeting our
demands in their interest," Shoch
continued, adding that the purpose was
to make it "more costly for them if
they didn't meet the demands."
The meeting then broke up into
affinity groups for about ninety
minutes, and reconvened about 10:30
p.m. lor more general discussion.
No major action by the Movement is
likely before Friday.

The Movement held another mass
meeting last night in the Old Union
courtyard. About 150 persons attended.
The session began with talks on four
topics- the Academic Senate's actions,
the choice of Encina Hall, the status of
the injunction, and the possibility of an
AFT strike.
First, the Senate's resolution of last
Friday was blasted as "a cop-out."
Doron Weinberg, suspended Law School
teaching assistant then discussed the
legal action the Movement was taking
against the injunction, and the
circumstances surrounding the
alteration of the clause concerning
suspended students.
Jim Shoch, another suspended
student, explained the reasons for
choosing Encina Hall as the site for last
week's abortive sit-in. "We had to hit at
the trustees' interests," he said.
Trustee's Interests
"We had to make meeting our
demands in their interest," Shoch
continued, adding that the purpose was
to make it "more costly for them if
they didn't meet the demands."
The meeting then broke up into
affinity groups for about ninety
minutes, and reconvened about 10:30
p.m. lor more general discussion.
No major action by the Movement is
likely before Friday.
At least 20 more students who
participated in the Encina sit-in have
been identified and will be suspended in
the near future according to the
administration.
The additional names were obtained
from faculty members who were
observing the sit-in.
Thirtv-four students have already
been suspended and enjoined by
Superior Court order from entering
certain areas of the campus.
The administration also announced
that teaching assistants (TA's) who have
been suspended will continue to receive
full pay but will not be allowed to teach
their classes. Additional TA's will be
hired at the same rate of pay to teach
the classes of the suspended TA's.
Office Entered
Yesterday afternoon one of the April
3rd Movement's "affinity" groups led
by a suspended student entered the
President's office. While conferring with
President Pitzer about the injunction,
the student told Pitzer that he was one
of those suspended. Pitzer then asked
the student to comply with the
injunction and leave the building.
According to Pitzer he did so. The
student says that he left with the entire
group after ten minutes of discussion
with the President.
Under the terms of the restraining
order, a suspended student is enjoined
from entering any classroom,
laboratory, library or other academic
building or any administrative building
of the University.
Violations of the injunction can be
handled in several ways. In civil court
proceedings handled through Superior
Court, the University has the option to
enforce the injunction or not. If they
choose to enforce it, the court orders
the defendant to appear before the
court to show cause why he shouldn't
be held in contempt of court. The court
can then jail, fine or release the
defendant.
In criminal proceedings the district
attorney can issue a warrant for the
defendant's arrest and charge him with
violating a court order. This is a
misdemeanor and would be handled by
municipal court. This can be done
without the Unviersity's participation.
Motion Filed
Three attorneys representing 22 of
the 39 named defendants filed a motion

yesterday morning in Superior Court lo
dissolve the temporary restraining order
obtained by the University Thursday
morning.
The memorandum of points filed
with the motion to dissolve asserts that
the court's order is "fatally" defective
and was void upon issuance. This charge
is based on the claim that it was
obtained e\ parte; that is without
formal or informal notice to the
defendants.
In addition, according to the
defendant's attorneys, a legal defense
organization with a staff, pool of
lawyers, office and telephone was in
operation and its existence was known
to Stanford University.
The judge set May 13 as the date for
hearing the defendant's motion. This is
also the day the defendants or their
attorneys must appear in court to show
cauae why the temporary injunction
should not be made permanent and the
date of the Trustee's meeting in San
Francisco.
