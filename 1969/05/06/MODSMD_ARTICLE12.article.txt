# Letters To The Editor
## Fundamental Standard Applies To Profs, Too 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
The SJC chairman. Professor
Friedenthal, has responded to my
letter in the DAILY of April 16,
in which I stated the SJC should
act in the case of the faculty
members who apparently behaved
deceitfully with regard to the
titles and descriptions of AEL
contracts.
Mr. Friedenthal informs me
that although he agrees the
substantive question is a serious
one, the SJC is powerless to act,
as it has no jurisdiction over
faculty members other than in
cases of campus disruption.
I regret my misapprehension
and I wish to apologize to Mr.
Friedenthal and to the SJC for
erroneously placing the onus at its
doorstep.
The onus apparently rests with
the Academic Senate, which by
making the faculty liable equally
with students for a particular
"offense" while ignoring the
whole range of infractions
traditionally covered by the
Fundamental Standard, has neatly
endorsed and even compounded
the same double standard most
people thought was being
terminated. Thus, the SJC could
bo required to prosecute a
professor who disrupts
(hypothetical) preparations for
germ warfare, but it has no
authority over another who may
have profited personally by
deceitfully concealing the fact of
those preparations.
The last sentence of my
previous letter needs only a
change in subject: if the Academic

Senate wishes to justify the
support and confidence of the
Stanford Community, then this is
one situation in which it has the
obligation to act.
In the meantime, it seems to
me that if students are to be tried
by SJC for participating in the
sit-in, then the faculty has the
duty to proceed through its own
agencies against those of its
members who are culpable in the
present affair.

• Definitions
Editor, THE DAILY:
Point of information: I note
that members of the Stanford
Community and particularly the
A3M have, in attempting to arrive
at a definition lor
co un t erin su rgency, found it
necessary to use the definition
found in a DOD publication,
"Dictionary of United States
Military Terms for Joint Usage,"
1964.
For the price of a postcard, I
have found that a 1968 edition of
this publication is for sale by the
Superintendent of Documents,
U.S. Government Printing Olfiee,
Washington, D.C., 20402, price
$2. I suggest that if we must rely
on DOD for definitions, that we
utilize the most recent document.

Editor. Till DAILY:
Secretary (if Defense Molvin

Laird says the USSR is attempting
to achieve a "first-strike"
capability with SS-9 missiles.
According to the Christian
Science Monitor (Ap .'SO),
"The Soviet SS-9 missile ... is
believed to be capable of carrying
one 20-25 megaton warhead or
three 5-megaton warheads. The
Titan 2 missile of which the US
has 54, can carry a single war head
of about 5-megatons."
According to Stuart
Symington, "A few months
ago . . . Dr. Alain Enthoven
testified that the SS-9 ICBM was a
second-strike weapon." I believe
Enthoven credited it with a
5-megaton warhead capacity at
that time. Laird re-evaluated the
intelligence.
The Newsweek Periscope (Ap
21) said, "The now model
Minute-man 3 with its three
independently targeted
one-megaton warheads will have a
CEP (circular error, probable) of a
% mile radius. By comparison, the
SS-9 has a CEP with a radius of at
least Vi mile. Minute-man 2 has a
M> mile CEP."
A 20-megaton weapon must hit
within .4 mile to destroy a
minute-man silo or control center.
A 5-megaton warhead needs to hit
within 1200 feet to zap a silo. 1 200
feet is about Vi mile.
Physicist Ralph Lapp said,
. . it would require 4000 such
(5-meg) warheads for the Soviet
Union to be able to launch a
first-strike that would knock out
enough US offensive weapons to
prevent substantial retaliation."
(from US ICBM's alone)

Newsweek (Ap 14) said, "The
US, if it allows the MIRV plan,
will increase the number of its
missile nuclear warheads from a
present level of about 1,700 to
more than 5,100.
"The danger, of course, is that
the Soviet Union may regard this
development of MIRV's as a step
toward an American first-strike
capability."
According to the Examiner
(May 2), ". . . . as one of five
options, a massive build-up of
offensive weapons enabling the
US to launch a surprise attack on
the Soviet Union" is to be
submitted to the NSC to plan our
nuclear strategy. And, for A3M
buffs, "The nuclear report . . . was
prepared by Deputy Defense
Secretary David Packard . . ."
Can the US increase
Minuteman and Titan payloads?
Can the MIRV 'A mile CEP bo
bettered to transfer to other
weapons? Will 5,100 warheads be
enough for a first-strike? Do
Soviet defense planners read tho
US press? How much do fallout
shelters cost?
The proof is left to the
student.

Editor, THE DAILY:
The community should bo
aware that Stanford's warmongers
not only continue to accept
research projects relating to
biological warfare, but have tho
audacity to announce them in the
Daily. See page 1 colum 2 of the

May sth Daily. The microwave
laboratory is attempting to
develop at enormous expense an
acoustic microscope that will
facilitate study of deadly
biological organisms. The
implications for CBW are all too
obvious.
