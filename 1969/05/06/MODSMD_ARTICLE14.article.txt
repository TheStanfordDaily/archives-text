## Civil Disobedience: On The Sit In 
### Thomas P. Boresford 
In his book, Concerning
Dissent and Civil Disobedience,
Justice Abe Fortas states the
following:
Civil disobedience, even in its
broadest sense, does not apply to
efforts to overthrow the
government or to seize control of
areas or parts of it by force, or by
the use of violence to compel the
government to grant a measure of
autonomy to part of its
population. These are programs of
revolution.
Through their forcible entry
and destructive occupation of
Encina Hall this morning, the
members of the April Third
Coalition lost all valid claims to
the protective traditions of civil
disobedience. Traditions of
extra-legal dissent, as practiced by
Gandhi, Martin Luther King, Jr.,
Dave Harris and others, are based
upon the non-violent breaking of
a law as a means of objection to
that law or as a means of focusing
attention one one's cause for
proposed change.
Forcible entry of the
University building does not
follow this non-violent code of
behavior, hence the movement's
action does not fall under the
category of civil disobedience. It
can be construed as little other

than a revolutionary tactic geared
to incite an administrative
reaction which could lead to the
closing of the University.
The sit-in of this morning is an
act of revolution rather than of
civil disobedience.
Functional Destruction
Current members of the April
Third Movement, as opposed to
those who sat-in at the Applied
Electronics Laboratory (for the
most part), seem only interested
in bringing the University to
functional destruction—rendering
it ineffective as an institution
wherein the free exchange of
knowledge can take place.
Their purpose in doing so
seems to include the following:
1) The University's Board of
Trustees, as yet unresponsive to
change, must either be forced into
immediate reform or be
functionally destroyed through
the effective destruction of the
University.
2) The University, as an
institution of an oppressive
society ("imperialist society"),
must immediately cease its
oppressive functioning or be
forced to cease its functioning
altogether.
3) Reform must come,
immediately, within the system or

the system will be torn down.
These either-or alternatives
reflect the dictum of Che
Guevarra, "In revolution, one
wins or dies." It is unfortunate, as
well as singularly ignorant, that
those at the core of the April
Third Movement can Only see
society as an either-or, in-or-out,
win-or-die proposition.
They leave no room for the
fact that people, themselves
included, are human. Humans
generally live in far less polarized
environments, make mistakes and
generally move slowly to avoid
making more mistakes. The more
polarized revolutionists, on the
other hand, try to be
super-human, more very quickly
and make a great many mistakes.
Neither Good Nor Bad
Contrary to this all-or-none
type of thinking, the University,
as it now stands, is neither wholly
good, nor wholly bad. Because it
is made up of people, its opinions
are diverse. But, because it is a
University—a place wherein free
discussion, analysis, thought, and
criticism take place —it is a
structure whose free and
continued function must be
preserved, whether from the
revolutionists in the S.D.S. or the
reactionaries in Sacramento.

The administration, faced with
a serious confrontation is
completely justified in judiciously
using a police force in dealing
with such sit-ins. This is not to say
that all such sit-ins and
demonstrations are aimed at
destruction of the University (eg.
that at A.E.L.). Nor is it to say
that force is the best of all
possible alternatives.
It is, however, justified in this
case, given the tactics of the
current sit-in.
Goals of the Demonstrators
The announced goal of today's
sit-in is to force some action on
the part of the Trustees in regard
to the S.R.I, question. The actual
goal appears to be the functional
disruption of the University, as
stated above.
The reasons for this
observation are as follows:
1) Tactics of force were used
which, in themselves, can only
lead (and did only lead) to a
serious confrontation with the
pol ice.
2) The sit-in was
inappropriately timed before the
Academic Senate meeting, the
SRI-Faculty meeting and the
impending studies of the alternate
SRI proposals, all of which
evolved from the first sit-in at
AEL.
3) Encina Hall, an
administration nerve center,
rather than an SRI building or
some laboratory, was chosen for
seizure.
4) Willful destruction of files,
offices and of the Stanford News
Service occured during the sit-in
by those sitting-in.
5 ) The movement now
continues more because of its

purely anti-administration
sentiment rather than on its
earlier anti-war research ideals.
In terms of both means and
ends, the current demonstration is
an invalid, as well as an
intellectually dishonest, form of
dissent, Tactically and
strategically, the sit-in as it now
stands is a fraud.
Morality and the University
All humanity, with our
generation near its forefront, faces
possible mass annihilation through
water and air pollution,
uncontrolled population growth,
and thermonuclear war. As a
soceity, our nation faces
destruction through our problems
of race, poor economic
distribution, varying health and
education standards, and the war.
If these and the myriads of
other problems cannot be solved
through intellectual, technological
and social capacities of those in
our Universities, the probabilities
are large that they will not be
solved at all. Destroy the
Universities and you destroy our
best hope for survival as the
human race.
If morality needs to be invoked
in issues such as these, certainly
the needless jeopardizing of
masses of human life through the
destruction of the universities
must be judged immoral.
