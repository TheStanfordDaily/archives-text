# Another Tactical Approach

Student demonstrators from the Australian
National University met police yesterday with the
most original weapon in the protester's
armoury—hot soup.
About 80 students were taking part in a
24-hour vigil over Aboriginal land rights opposite
Parliament House on Monday night and had
ordered soup, meat pies and coffee for breakfast.
When the food arrived early yesterday they invited
the attendant police to share the meal and the
constables gratefully accepted. Last year the police
provided transport for hot coffee and sandwiches
for the land rights demonstrators.
Soon after breakfast yesterday the police had
the opportunity to repay their student hosts.
When rain threatened to wreck the vigil the police
contacted the university and arranged to take a
10-foot by 10-foot tent from the city to the
demonstrators.
After their tent was erected the students

dispensed pies and soup to the police, press and
politicians who dropped in.
After the demonstration the students passed a
vote of thanks to the police for their
understanding throughout the demonstration. The
senior policeman present thanked the students for
their co-operation.
During the day student leaders interviewed the
Minister in Charge of Aboriginal Affairs, Mr.
Wentworth and the Member for the Northern
Territory, Mr. Calder (Lib). They described their
talks as "not very useful."
Sighting the Prime Minister, Mr. Gorton, in
Parliament House, one student presented him with
a copy of the student-produced Aboriginal
Quarterly containing full details of the complaints
of the Yirrkala tribe in its action for possession of
the Gove Peninsula area.
"He didn't seem all that interested," she said,
"but he did ask me if we needed another tent."
