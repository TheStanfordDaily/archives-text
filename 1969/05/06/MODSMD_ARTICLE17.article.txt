## Faculty Action Sought 
### John Perrin 
Professor of Economics Joan
Robinson who was invited to
lecture by the Associated
Students of Stanford University is
fully in support of the demands of
the April Third Movement and is
taking every action she can as a
visiting member of the Stanford
Community to support the
Movement.
Responding to the recent
suspensions and injunction
invoked by the Trustees through
President Pitzer and the
administration to suspend further
disruptive and effective political
actions by the April Third
Movement Professor Robinson
will deliver her lectures outside of
University buildings as long as her
students desire it so that
suspended students can legally
attend class and not incur fines or
jail sentences. 124,
124 (A)-(B)-(C) will be held on
the lawn outside the Economics
Building at the regular times.
Professor Robinson's telephone
call this morning was the first
positive ACTION I have heard of
from the faculty since I told my
professors goodby for a while and
carried all of my books out of the
Law School office where I do
research sometimes.
Intent
We do not mean to destroy the

University. We do mean to
destroy the set of values that say a
researcher or professor is not
responsible for the War actions of
the United States of the Ghetto
conditions when his work and the
prestiege of the University are
used to build, sanctify and run
governmental, business and
military institutions and programs
that destroy democracy and
freedom for man abroad and in
our urban areas.
CBW research has no place in
the University or in a University
initiated and owned research
institution. Counter-Insurgency
Research was a vehicle of this war
that everyone agrees needs to be
stopped.
And finally because of the
policies of the present government
and the interests of AMERICAN
companies any research being
done in Southeast Asia will be
necessary to the determent of the
freedom, political integrity and
independence of the Southeast
Asian peoples and must be
stopped.
No Time For Sadness
There is no time for being sad
that the Professors in Stanford's
community do not understand the
necessity for political action in
order to stop the use of the^

University for aggressive war
planning. Our professors must see
by our confrontation politics and
our discourse, by our political
activities on every level in
between, our searching
self-education in the April Third
Movement two things.
First we have no other
effective political force other than
the threat or fact of disruption of
specific activities in the
University. Second that no action
on the War Research question, no
significant action to stop this
research will be taken without
application of political force.
Another point we all are
coming to see is the University is
being destroyed by the
subordination of the University
community to the role of builder,
mover and santifier of American
Power Growth.
Something is wrong in a
University where it is debatable
whether the United States
Military actions in Vietnam, Laos,
and Cambodia are immoral or
illegal, Yet because of the climate
of opinion, or the professional
and personal interests and training
of our community's members it is
debatable whether the war
research that has allowed this
modern nation to destroy about a
million Vietnamese
(COMMUNISTS) in a brutal,
inhumane, and insane action is
politically necessary.
You, our professors, must
understand, we still recognize you
have skills, training, experienced
intellect and information as well
as contacts we need in order to

change the values and ordering of
the Universities to stop this
destructive and inhuman
progression of growth. To destroy
the University itself would be a
setback to the present political
action and all others of students
and intellectuals in an attempt to
harness American Power
internationally and redemocratize
tn? troubled and unrepresentative
political process in order to solve
domestic crisis level problems in
our cities and economy.
The temporary restraining
order and injunction are designed
to prevent any effective political
actions on this campus.
Speaking as a member of the
April Third Movement, we are
grateful to Professor Robinson of
Cambridge, England for active
assistance to achieve the goals of
the April Third Movement.

subordination of the University
community to the role of builder,
mover and santifier of American
Power Growth.
Something is wrong in a
University where it is debatable
whether the United States
Military actions in Vietnam, Laos,
and Cambodia are immoral or
illegal, Yet because of the climate
of opinion, or the professional
and personal interests and training
of our community's members it is
debatable whether the war
research that has allowed this
modern nation to destroy about a
million Vietnamese
(COMMUNISTS) in a brutal,
inhumane, and insane action is
politically necessary.
You, our professors, must
understand, we still recognize you
have skills, training, experienced
intellect and information as well
as contacts we need in order to

change the values and ordering of
the Universities to stop this
destructive and inhuman
progression of growth. To destroy
the University itself would be a
setback to the present political
action and all others of students
and intellectuals in an attempt to
harness American Power
internationally and redemocratize
tn? troubled and unrepresentative
political process in order to solve
domestic crisis level problems in
our cities and economy.
The temporary restraining
order and injunction are designed
to prevent any effective political
actions on this campus.
Speaking as a member of the
April Third Movement, we are
grateful to Professor Robinson of
Cambridge, England for active
assistance to achieve the goals of
the April Third Movement.

Graduate in Law-Ed.)
Professor of Economics Joan
Robinson who was invited to
lecture by the Associated
Students of Stanford University is
fully in support of the demands of
the April Third Movement and is
taking every action she can as a
visiting member of the Stanford
Community to support the
Movement.
Responding to the recent
suspensions and injunction
invoked by the Trustees through
President Pitzer and the
administration to suspend further
disruptive and effective political
actions by the April Third
Movement Professor Robinson
will deliver her lectures outside of
University buildings as long as her
students desire it so that
suspended students can legally
attend class and not incur fines or
jail sentences. 124,
124 (A)-(B)-(C) will be held on
the lawn outside the Economics
Building at the regular times.
Professor Robinson's telephone
call this morning was the first
positive ACTION I have heard of
from the faculty since I told my
professors goodby for a while and
carried all of my books out of the
Law School office where I do
research sometimes.
Intent
We do not mean to destroy the

University. We do mean to
destroy the set of values that say a
researcher or professor is not
responsible for the War actions of
the United States of the Ghetto
conditions when his work and the
prestiege of the University are
used to build, sanctify and run
governmental, business and
military institutions and programs
that destroy democracy and
freedom for man abroad and in
our urban areas.
CBW research has no place in
the University or in a University
initiated and owned research
institution. Counter-Insurgency
Research was a vehicle of this war
that everyone agrees needs to be
stopped.
And finally because of the
policies of the present government
and the interests of AMERICAN
companies any research being
done in Southeast Asia will be
necessary to the determent of the
freedom, political integrity and
independence of the Southeast
Asian peoples and must be
stopped.
No Time For Sadness
There is no time for being sad
that the Professors in Stanford's
community do not understand the
necessity for political action in
order to stop the use of the^

University for aggressive war
planning. Our professors must see
by our confrontation politics and
our discourse, by our political
activities on every level in
between, our searching
self-education in the April Third
Movement two things.
First we have no other
effective political force other than
the threat or fact of disruption of
specific activities in the
University. Second that no action
on the War Research question, no
significant action to stop this
research will be taken without
application of political force.
Another point we all are
coming to see is the University is
being destroyed by the
subordination of the University
community to the role of builder,
mover and santifier of American
Power Growth.
