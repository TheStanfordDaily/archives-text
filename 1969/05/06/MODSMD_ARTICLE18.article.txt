# SRI Receives Ford Grant For Research In Pakistan
## 
### 
The Ford Foundation
announced a grant of $200,000 to
Stanford Research Institute to
further research on small industry
development in East Pakistan.
The funds will carry through
1970 the work of an SRI research
team which, since 1964, has been
assisting the East Pakistan Small
Industries Corporation (a
governmental agency) in the
development of small industrial

units. The SRI team provides
economic, financial and technical
assistance to the Corporation's
planners.
Over the past five years the
guidance supplied by SRI
researchers has resulted in some
$6.8 million of new investment
capital becoming available for new
small businesses. Some 18
industrial parts—real estate
developments subdivided and
- provided with utilities to
stimulate small business
construction—have been laid out.
Four such parks are in full
operation, with a substantial
number of plants under
construction or in operation.
"With funds from the Ford
Foundation, and responding to
expressed needs of the East
Pakistani government, SRI has
been able to greatly strengthen
this nation's ability to amass local

capital and attract foreign capital
to finance a significant expansion
in small business enterprise,"
explained Dr. Weldon B. Gibson,
Executive Vice President of SRI.
"Funds have been invested in
31 different industrial projects,
including a number of
badly-needed cold storage plants
located throughout the country.
The plants have reduced the
drastic fluctuations in food prices
which caused so much distress in
East Pakistan's agricultural
sector."
