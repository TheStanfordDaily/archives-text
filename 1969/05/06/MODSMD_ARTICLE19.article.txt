# Research Fellow To Talk On Adventures In Mexico
## 
### JORGE GARCIA 
Bertram Wolfe, who is now a
Senior Research Fellow at the
Hoover Institution, will speak on
"The Extraordinary Adventures
of a Yankee in Mexico," on
Wednesday, May 7, at 4:15 p.m.,
in Room 275 TMU. The lecture is
sponsored by the California
Institute of International Studies
and is open to the public free of
charge.
Mr. Wolfe, presently writing his
memoirs, lived through some of
the most turbulent events of
Mexican History during the first
quarter of this century. "I lived in
Mexico," recalls Mr. Wolfe,
"during the presidencies of
Obregon and Calles, and was an
eyewitness to three political
shootings. I was also a member of
the Teachers Union of Mexico,
the Newspaper Union, and served

as Educational Director of the
Railmens Union."
When Mr. Wolfe and his wife
left New York for Mexico, neither
spoke a word of Spanish. "We
started teaching ourselves Spanish
on the steamboat to Vera Cruz
and on the train to Mexico City.
In the Mexican Capital, my wife
and I purposedly avoided the
American colony. I read
'Excelsior' every day to enlarge
my Spanish vocabulary."
Mr. Wolfe taught English until
he had mastered Spanish
sufficiently to be able to lecture
on economics. As an educator, he
worked under Mexican
philosopher Jose Vasconcelos,
who was then Minister of
Education.
In 1925, Mr. Wolfe received an
M.A. in Spanish Letters from the
National University of Mexico.
His thesis, written under Pedro
Henriquez Urena, was "The
Traditional Spanish Ballad as It
Lives in the Oral Tradition of
Mexico."
Upon his return to the United
States, Mr. Wolfe studied at
Colombia University under Angel
del Rio, who had been a student
of his in Mexico.
In 1939, with Hitler and Stalin
on the international scene, Mr.
Wolfe decided to leave the Latin

American field and concentrate
on Russian affairs. The result was
his bestseller Three Who Made a
Revolution.
Mr. Wolfe has published
extensively on both Latin
America and Russia. His works
have been translated into 18
languages. Curiously, his two
works on Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera (Diego Rivera, His Life and
Times and The Fabulous Life of
Diego Rivera) have never appeared
in Spanish because of their critical
view of the Mexican Government.
"Nevertheless," says Mr. Wolfe,
"they are available in English in
several Mexico City bookstores
and continue to sell very well
even today."
Mr. Wolfe's last teaching job
was as Distinguished Visiting
Professor of Russian History at
the University of California at
Davis. He was awarded an
Honorary Doctor of Law Degree
at that institution.
"I am returning to the Hispanic
field for this lecture," comments
Mr. Wolfe, "only because I wish
to reveal facts about the
personality of Mexico which
many people ignore or
misunderstand. Mexicans, you
know, have a different attitude
towards life and death."

and is open to the public free of

Mr. Wolfe, presently writing his
memoirs, lived through some of
the most turbulent events of
Mexican History during the first
quarter of this century. "I lived in
Mexico," recalls Mr. Wolfe,
"during the presidencies of
Obregon and Calles, and was an
eyewitness to three political
shootings. I was also a member of
the Teachers Union of Mexico,
the Newspaper Union, and served

as Educational Director of the
Railmens Union."
When Mr. Wolfe and his wife
left New York for Mexico, neither
spoke a word of Spanish. "We
started teaching ourselves Spanish
on the steamboat to Vera Cruz
and on the train to Mexico City.
In the Mexican Capital, my wife
and I purposedly avoided the
American colony. I read
'Excelsior' every day to enlarge
my Spanish vocabulary."
Mr. Wolfe taught English until
he had mastered Spanish
sufficiently to be able to lecture
on economics. As an educator, he
worked under Mexican
philosopher Jose Vasconcelos,
who was then Minister of
Education.
In 1925, Mr. Wolfe received an
M.A. in Spanish Letters from the
National University of Mexico.
His thesis, written under Pedro
Henriquez Urena, was "The
Traditional Spanish Ballad as It
Lives in the Oral Tradition of
Mexico."
Upon his return to the United
States, Mr. Wolfe studied at
Colombia University under Angel
del Rio, who had been a student
of his in Mexico.
In 1939, with Hitler and Stalin
on the international scene, Mr.
Wolfe decided to leave the Latin

American field and concentrate
on Russian affairs. The result was
his bestseller Three Who Made a
Revolution.
Mr. Wolfe has published
extensively on both Latin
America and Russia. His works
have been translated into 18
languages. Curiously, his two
works on Mexican muralist Diego
Rivera (Diego Rivera, His Life and
Times and The Fabulous Life of
Diego Rivera) have never appeared
in Spanish because of their critical
view of the Mexican Government.
"Nevertheless," says Mr. Wolfe,
"they are available in English in
several Mexico City bookstores
and continue to sell very well
even today."
Mr. Wolfe's last teaching job
was as Distinguished Visiting
Professor of Russian History at
the University of California at
Davis. He was awarded an
Honorary Doctor of Law Degree
at that institution.
"I am returning to the Hispanic
field for this lecture," comments
Mr. Wolfe, "only because I wish
to reveal facts about the
personality of Mexico which
many people ignore or
misunderstand. Mexicans, you
know, have a different attitude
towards life and death."
