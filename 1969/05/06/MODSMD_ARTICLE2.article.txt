# Housing Draw Slated To Begin Tomorrow
## 
### 
The opening round of the housing
draw lor campus residences will begin
tomorrow. All students who plan to live
in University housing must participate
in the draw.
Not all students will be able to find
space on campus this year, according to
Assistant Dean of Students Bob Rosch.
Unlike previous years, all students
who want to live on campus, not only
those changing residences, must enter
the draw. Thus, everyone, except next
year's entering freshmen, will have an
equal chance of being unassigned to a
campus residence regardless of class or
sex.
Those students who wish to remain
within their present campus residence
next fall, however, will not lose their
priority if they succeed in drawing any
University housing
Students planning to take part in the

draw must obtain a draw card from
their residence director. On this card the
student will list his preferences for
particular housing units.
The draw cards must be taken to the
registrar's office on Wednesday,
Thursday, or Friday where a draw
number will be selected. This number
determines the order of placement in
residences.
Results of the first round will be
available to residence directors on May
20. Those students not assigned to any
of their choices and those who reject
their first round assignment may then
enter the second round of the housing
draw.
Waiting Lists
Students who still have not been
assigned to a University residence after
the second round of the draw will be
placed on waiting lists.
