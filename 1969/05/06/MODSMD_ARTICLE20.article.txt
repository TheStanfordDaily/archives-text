# California Supreme Court
## Abortion Law Challenged 
### JULIE FLEECE 
The first constitutional
challenge to the Therapeutic
Abortion Act of 1967 is now
being considered by the California
Supreme Court. The case is an
appeal by Dr. Leon Belous of Los
Angeles who was convicted on an
abortion charge after he referred
an unmarried, pregnant girl to
another doctor who performed
the abortion.
Dr. Belous' attorney presented
a brief saying that "there is no

compelling state interest which
justifies overriding this most
personal right of a woman not to
be compelled to bear a child."
The State's position is that the
Legislature has decided to act for
the welfare of the child from its
point of conception.
The Supreme Court decision
on this case will, in effect,
determine whether the state has a
constitutional right to decide
whether or not a woman may
obtain an abortion.

The Therapeutic Abortion Act,
which has been in effect since
November 8, 1967, provides
procedures for therapeutic
abortions where "there is a
substantial risk that continuance
of the pregnancy would gravely
impair the physical or mental
health of the mother" or when
the pregnancy results from rape or
incest.
Opponents of liberalized
abortion fear that repeal of this
law would result in widespread
abortion practices. Some feel that
even this law has resulted in too
large an increase in the number of
abortions performed.
However, Stanford Hospital
authorities report that there was
"no great surge of activity after
the law went into effect." The
hospital performed 708
therapeutic abortions in 1968.
The number of abortions has
shown a gradual but steady rise
since long before the 1967 law
was passed. This increase has
continued throughout the first
part of 1969, and Stanford
Hospital now performs an average
of 80 therapeutic abortions each
month.
Number of Abortions Increasing
The number of legal abortions
at Stanford Hospital represents an
estimated twelve to fourteen
percent of the state's total. The
State Department of Public
Health reported that during the
first 11 months under the new law
3,775 therapeutic abortions were
performed in California. The
actual number is slightly higher,
because hospitals are only
requested and not required to
report the number of abortions
they perform.
One Stanford Hospital source
said, "There are no hospitals in
the state of California in which
more therapeutic abortions are
being performed." He added that
other factors, such as the size of
each hospital, can enter into these
statistics.
He indicated that the number
of abortions at Stanford Hospital
can not continue increasing at the
same rate indefinitely because of'
the limits on available physicians
and hospital facilities.
The incidence of therapeutic
abortions at Stanford Hospital
coincides with the rest of the San
Francisco Bay Area, where an
unusually high percentage of the
state's abortions occur. While this
area has only 23 percent of the
state's live births, it performs 63
percent of the abortions.
Affects of Social Stigma
No one really knows the
reasons for this large discrepancy.
However, sources at both
Stanford Hospital and Cowell
Health Center stressed the
influence of sociological factors
on the abortion rate as more
important than medical concerns.
The trend in the Bay Area
seems to be toward a wider social

acceptance of- therapeutic
abortion.
Perhaps in places outside the
Bay Area the former stigma
attached to abortions as criminal
and immoral is more persistent.
Sentiments against abortion are,
according to one doctor, a
holdover from older societies
where a high birth rate was
necessary to replenish the
population lost through disease,
war, and a generally shorter life
span. Some religions, as well, find
abortions directly contrary to
their ethical and moral teachings.
Rigid Government Control
Another factor which limits
the number of abortions is the
procedure set forth in the
Therapeutic Abortion Act. The
law requires documents by a
gynecologist and two specialists in
the field for which the abortion is
being requested (psychiatrists if
the reason is mental health).
These recommendations are
submitted to the hospital where
the abortion is to be performed
and a committee of physicians
must approve each application.
In the case of a request on the
grounds of rape or incest, the
county district attorney must
inform the committee that there
is probable cause that the
pregnancy resulted from rape or
incest before the committee may
approve the abortion.
Proponents of the present law
say it is this somewhat complex
procedure which keeps the
abortion rate from increasing
drastically. Conversely, those who
favor a repeal of the law find such
a procedure unduly confining to a
woman's individual liberty to
decide whether or not to bear a
child.
Efforts to Repeal the Law
From a purely medical point of
view, there is no other medical
procedure which is subject to such
rigid government control. The
California Medical Association is
presently considering a resolution
which would recommend that the
state legislature repeal all statutes
and criminal laws dealing with
abortions.
California's Therapeutic
Abortion Act, although
recognized as one of the more
liberal such laws in the country,
will continue to feel the pressures
of those who advocate complete
liberty of personal decision and
individual doctors' discretion in
abortion procedures.
Dr. Belous' appeal is only the
first of many challenges to the
state law. Several other cases are
still in the lower courts, involving
nine San Francisco doctors who
were disciplined by the State
Board of Medical Examiners for
performing abortions on women
who had contracted German
measles in early pregnancy and
risked bearing a deformed baby.
