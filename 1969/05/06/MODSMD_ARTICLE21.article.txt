## 
### 
The Black Drama Group Oi
Stanford's Black Student Union
(BSU) will present a trilogy of
plays at the end of May. Their
productions of "The Electronic
Nigger," "A Son Come Home"
and "Ole Judge Mose is Dead"
will be the maiden effort of the

BSU's Black Cultural Arts
division.
"The Electronic Nigger" by Ed
Bullins won the Vernon Rice
award for the best off-Broadway
play during the 1968-69 season.
"A Son Come Home," also by
Bullins, and "Ole Judge Mose" by
Joseph White, are both described
as powerful revolutionary
dramatizations of the plight of
American Negroes.
Public showing of the trilogy,
for which tickets are available at
Tresidder Union box office, will
be at 8 p.m. May 25-26 and 28-29
in Dinkelspiel Auditorium. The
performances will mark the first
West Coast showing of the plays
and their first production by a
college theater group.
Bullins, author of the first two
plays, is playwright-in-residence
for Harlem's New Lafayette
Theater. His work has been

published in "The Negro Digest"
and"The Journal of Black
Poetry."
Play director will be John
Cochran, former artist-in-resi
dence at San Francisco City
College. He was one of the
organizers of the Black Arts
Drama Group in San Francisco
and is under consideration as
black d irector-in-residence at
Stanford next fall.
"The Electronic Nigger" is set
in a Southern California junior
college. It revolves around the
psychological problems of a
highly intelligent black student
named Carpentier, and his

teacher, Prof. Jones.
The second Bullins play, "A
Son Come Home," is a dialogue
between an aging mother and her
son, who has just returned from
the Army.
White's "Ole Judge Mose is
Dead" concerns changes which
take place in the black
community behind the power
structure.
Acting and production duties
will be shared between BSU
members and the Palo Alto black
community. Johnie H. Scott of
the BSU will be executive
producer. Scott is a junior English
major.
