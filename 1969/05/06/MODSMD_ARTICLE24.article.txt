# SRT To Close Season With 'The Jew Of Malta'
## 
### GARY LINDSEY 
The fantastic world of a
political cartoon unfolds in the
Stanford Repertory Theater's
final production of the season,
"The Jew of Malta" by
Christopher Marlowe.
This insolent farce will play at
8 p.m., May 7-10 and 14-17, and
at 2 p.m., May 10 in Memorial
Auditorium.
Built upon the myths of
medieval Christianity and the
prejudices of Elizabethan
England, Marlowe's classic shoots
satiric barbs at religious
hypocrisy.
Malta, besieged by the Turks,
demands that the Jews alone give
up one-half of their gold to
ransom the island. Barabas
refuses. When the Governor seizes
all his wealth, Barabas sets out on

a course of revenge unparalleled in
its evil.
"The Jew of Malta" is directed
by Edgar Reynolds, assistant
professor of drama. Reynolds has
for three years directed at the
Colorado Shakespeare Festival.
Barabas is so diabolical, the
Governor so corrupt, the Catholic
friars so lecherous, and the Turks
so tyrannical that Reynolds has
directed the play as a wild, savage,
impossible farce.
The characters are beyond real
life. They are exaggerated
cartoons of men manipulated by
untold forces. To achieve this idea
in the production, Marguerite
Olsen has created puppets to
represent several of the minor
characters, the Turkish and
Christian armies, slaves, nuns, and
merchants.

The set, designed by Steven M.
Vickers, represents the paper
world of a political cartoon. It is
like a marionette stage, complete
with trapdoors, mechanical
surprises, and even a
"self-destructing" city. The tiny
island of Malta becomes a
microcosmic world of
grotesqueries and monstrosities.
Marlowe's Barabas is the
incarnation of evil, the first major
villian of the English stage. The
role will be played by SRT Acting
Fellow Stephen D. Newman. He
has acted professionally with the
National Shakespeare Festival in
San Diego, the California
Shakespeare Festival in Los Gatos,
and has for the past two seasons
played leading roles at SRT.
