## Campuses Boil 
### ASSOCIATED PRESS 
A group of militant Southern
University students seized an
administration building on the New
Orleans campus Monday, but withdrew
when th<> Louisiana National Guard was
alerted to move in.
Gov. -John McKeithen held the guard
back but declared: "We're not going to
back down one inch. We're going to
keep the guard around tomorrow and as
long as we need them. They had defied
us earlier but it looks like when they
heard the National Guard was coming
out, they left."
Classes at the predominantly Negro
campus of Southern University were
suspended after the seizure was staged
by an estimated 200 students, from
among the school's 1,700.
A fire broke out early yesterday in
the Naval ROTC building at Harvard
University and officials said the blaze
definitely was set.
Damage from the flames was
confined to one large room in the
building, said Depty Fire Chief John F.
Kennedy.
A weekend of turmoil at the Madison
campus of the University of Wisconsin
continued Monday, when police broke
up a rally of about 300 students outside
the Dane County Jail. The
demonstrators were protesting weekend
arrests of fellow students.
About 250 Negro students were

arrested after refusing to break up a
demonstration in front of the Alabama
state capitol at Montgomery. Most of
them had been involved in nearly six
weeks of protests at Alabama State
College, which was closed for two weeks
beginning April 7. Those arrested were
placed under bond of $300 each on
charges of failing to obey police orders.
Demonstrations continued to plague
school officials in New York City.
