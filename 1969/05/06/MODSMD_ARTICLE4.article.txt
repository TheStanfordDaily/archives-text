# Basis For Action
## A3M Uses Affinity Groups 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER 
Affinity groups are presently the
most active part of the April 3rd
Movement. Conceived as a forum where
people of divergent political viewpoints
could discuss the goals, identity, and
tactics of the Movement, the infinity
groups have become a basis for action.
Visits to SRI, fasts, and conferences
with President Pitzer, have been
initiated, in the first four days of their
existence.
Often called "infinity groups," these
gatherings originated out of last Friday's
co-ordinating committee meeting. They
are u continuation of the discussion
groups held at the Applied Electronics
Lab (AEL) sit-in last month. There are
presently 14 groups, each with more
than 15 members, and they are growing
rapidly.
The '' William H. Hewlett
Fragmentation Bomb Infinity Group"
has been particularly gregarious.
Monday's activities started at 10 a.m.,
with about 16 people meeting outside
Pitzer's office. He emerged and talked
to them, they said, explaining the
difficulties of keeping the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) within the
university, and expressing his
satisfaction with the recent action of
the Academic Senate.
Terry Fitzgerald and Steve Mantis,
Stanford students, told Pitzer that they
were starting a fast outside his office.
They will Last until the Trustee's
meeting on May 13, living in a tent in
the Quad. Fitzgerald described their
action as "a different kind of force." He

said that it "expresses how damn serious
we consider the issues to be."
Encina Hall Tour
Fitzgerland and Mantis joined their
infinity group for a tour of Encina Hall.
After a visit to the general secretary's
office and to the news service, they
were sent to the office of Danial
de Young, the Assistant Business
Manager. "People were really up tight,"
one of the members commented.
Two Stanford policemen who had
been hastily called were turned away,
and the William H. Hewlett
Fragmentation Bomb Infinity Group
talked to Daryl Pearson, General
Secretary, about the funding of the
University.
Most of the groups, however, have so
far concentrated on discussion. Then
members are invariably enthusiastic.
Many of the affinity groups met two or
three times over the weekend. An effort
is being made through them to solidify
and expand the April 3rd Movement.
Spirit Of AEL
Some see the groups as a return to
the spirit of the AEL sit-in. Others feel
that a single political viewpoint for the
Movement should come from them. Still
others describe their groups as
encounter sessions, where members can
get to know each other and freely
express their feelings about the
Movement. They are a "form where
everybody can make themselves heard,"
uninhibited by the microphones of
larger meetings.

Such questions as the reasons for the
Encina Hall sit-in, the injunctions, and
the right of the Trustees to own
Stanford are frequently discussed, as
well as ways to attain the Movement's
goal of keeping SRI within the
University.
Proposals for affinity group action
include phone-ins and mill-ins, a tent
city in White Plaza, the production of a
wall newspaper, and calling in to radio
talk shows. One affinity group, the
"Ugly Americans for Freedom" are
thinking of staging a benefit to buy (he
services of an SRI staff member
currently engaged in war research His
research would be redirected

Elected members of each, affinity
group make up a large part of the
Movement's co-ordinating committee, a
group which plans the agenda for
Movement meetings. "This changes the
decision making process of the body,"
said one representative, "in that the
ideas are coming up from the affinity
groups as well as from individuals."
At a meeting of the Movement last
night, proposals for mass action were
presented by representatives of the
various groups. As a response to
"unacceptable" action by the Trustees
at their May 13 meeting in San
Francisco, tactics ranging from mill-ins
or a general boycott to "something
beyond a sit-in" were proposed.
The Movement members took great
pleasure in naming their groups.

Elected members of each, affinity
group make up a large part of the
Movement's co-ordinating committee, a
group which plans the agenda for
Movement meetings. "This changes the
decision making process of the body,"
said one representative, "in that the
ideas are coming up from the affinity
groups as well as from individuals."
At a meeting of the Movement last
night, proposals for mass action were
presented by representatives of the
various groups. As a response to
"unacceptable" action by the Trustees
at their May 13 meeting in San
Francisco, tactics ranging from mill-ins
or a general boycott to "something
beyond a sit-in" were proposed.
The Movement members took great
pleasure in naming their groups.
Affinity groups are presently the
most active part of the April 3rd
Movement. Conceived as a forum where
people of divergent political viewpoints
could discuss the goals, identity, and
tactics of the Movement, the infinity
groups have become a basis for action.
Visits to SRI, fasts, and conferences
with President Pitzer, have been
initiated, in the first four days of their
existence.
Often called "infinity groups," these
gatherings originated out of last Friday's
co-ordinating committee meeting. They
are u continuation of the discussion
groups held at the Applied Electronics
Lab (AEL) sit-in last month. There are
presently 14 groups, each with more
than 15 members, and they are growing
rapidly.
The '' William H. Hewlett
Fragmentation Bomb Infinity Group"
has been particularly gregarious.
Monday's activities started at 10 a.m.,
with about 16 people meeting outside
Pitzer's office. He emerged and talked
to them, they said, explaining the
difficulties of keeping the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) within the
university, and expressing his
satisfaction with the recent action of
the Academic Senate.
Terry Fitzgerald and Steve Mantis,
Stanford students, told Pitzer that they
were starting a fast outside his office.
They will Last until the Trustee's
meeting on May 13, living in a tent in
the Quad. Fitzgerald described their
action as "a different kind of force." He

said that it "expresses how damn serious
we consider the issues to be."
Encina Hall Tour
Fitzgerland and Mantis joined their
infinity group for a tour of Encina Hall.
After a visit to the general secretary's
office and to the news service, they
were sent to the office of Danial
de Young, the Assistant Business
Manager. "People were really up tight,"
one of the members commented.
Two Stanford policemen who had
been hastily called were turned away,
and the William H. Hewlett
Fragmentation Bomb Infinity Group
talked to Daryl Pearson, General
Secretary, about the funding of the
University.
Most of the groups, however, have so
far concentrated on discussion. Then
members are invariably enthusiastic.
Many of the affinity groups met two or
three times over the weekend. An effort
is being made through them to solidify
and expand the April 3rd Movement.
Spirit Of AEL
Some see the groups as a return to
the spirit of the AEL sit-in. Others feel
that a single political viewpoint for the
Movement should come from them. Still
others describe their groups as
encounter sessions, where members can
get to know each other and freely
express their feelings about the
Movement. They are a "form where
everybody can make themselves heard,"
uninhibited by the microphones of
larger meetings.

Such questions as the reasons for the
Encina Hall sit-in, the injunctions, and
the right of the Trustees to own
Stanford are frequently discussed, as
well as ways to attain the Movement's
goal of keeping SRI within the
University.
Proposals for affinity group action
include phone-ins and mill-ins, a tent
city in White Plaza, the production of a
wall newspaper, and calling in to radio
talk shows. One affinity group, the
"Ugly Americans for Freedom" are
thinking of staging a benefit to buy (he
