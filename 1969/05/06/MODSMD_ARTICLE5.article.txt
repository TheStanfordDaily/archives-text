"Most of the staff at SRI are
concerned that outside groups would
abridge their freedom to decide what
types of research they will do,"
according to Dr. William Piatt.
Piatt, Director of Human
Development Research at SRI; Denis
Hayes, former President of ASSU; and
Professor Dale Collinson of the Stanford
Law School were among the speakers
who addressed a meeting called by the
Coalition for an Academic Community
(CAC) last night in Tresidder Large
Lounge. About Â«eventy-five people
attended.
Jackson Booth, a member of the
Executive Board of CAC, said the
meeting was called "to get in touch with
the Stanford Community and discuss
issues which we think are relevant."
Beginning of CAC
Gilbert Diaz, a founder of CAC,
spoke first and explained that the CAC
began as a group of engineers suffering
on account of the AEL sit-in. Diaz said
the engineers and others decided to
form a group "to oppose radical
activities which are detrimental to
academic freedom."
CAC President Jim Schnieder
explained a petition which the CAC is
now circulating among students,
faculty, staff and alumni. The petition
would provide for a hearing before the
Board of Trustees contingent upon the
acceptance of a petition signed by 20%
of the student body.
The meeting was then addressed by
Piatt, who defended the freedom of the
SRI staff to decide what kinds of
research they will do.
Piatt admitted that classified research
was against the spirit of a university, but
said that SRI is really not a part of the
University.

Piatt had himself given up working
on research for the Defense Department
to work in Urban and Social Systems at
SRI. He stressed the work that SHI does
in urban development, transportation
studies, air and water pollution and
other "socially constructive work."
A member of the April Thirc.
Movement was invited to address the
meeting, and Steve Van Tuyl stepped
up. In response to a question about
tactics, Van 'l'uyl, who is not a student
at Stanford, said, "We can talk all we
want, and people will say 'yeah, yeah.'
But putting your life and body on the
line is a very different matter."
A beer inug was presented to Denis
Hayes for his efforts on behalf of the
Stanford Community last year. Hayes,
who is not a member of CAC, said he
had signed the CAC petition on Trustee
hearings. He added, 'lowever, that he
thought the basic problem at Stanford
was not communication, but differences
in values.
Colli neon then explained the
provisions of the temporary restraining
order and answered questions about its
legal aspects.
After the meeting was over, several
students stayed to talk in informal
groups. Jim Schniedor explained the
goals of CAC: "Initially, we formed as
an organization to counter the
disruptive activity of the April 3rd
Movement. We intend to continue to
retard the group's momentum, but we
are also committed to improving
governing structures within the
University to the end that groups will
not feel the need to act from
frustration."
Jack Booth added, "CAC exists to
try to provide new channels for
communication where, perhaps, others
have failed."
