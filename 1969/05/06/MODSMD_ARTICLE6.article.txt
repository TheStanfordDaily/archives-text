## Pompidou Gains In France 
### 
PARIS (AP)—An attempt by
France's left wing to run a unity
presidential candidate against Goerges
Pompidou dissolved Monday,
strengthening the former premier's
position as front runner in elections
June 1 to pick a successor to Charles de
Gaulle.
The Communist party, the New
Socialist party and the Unified Socialist
party, each nominated men to oppose
Pompidou after failing to agree on a
joint candidate.
The Communists dug deep into their
stable of old war horses to pick Jacques
Duclos, a 72-year-old senator, as their
nominee. Earlier in the day, the
Socialists had named Gaston Defferre,
mayor of Marseille. And late Sunday the
Unified Socialist Party, a small extreme
left group, nominated Michel Rocard,
39-year-old civil servant.
The left wing seemed disoriented and
floating. Rather than issuing a fighting
declaration, Duclos said pessimistically:
"The Frenchmen and women who voted
'no' on April 27 hoped for an alliance
on the basis of defined policy. This
union alone would have permitted the
defeat of Pompidou but the Socialist
party did not hesitate to take the
responsibility for refusing such a
union."
• Black Unemployment
WASHINGTON ( A P ) -
U nem ploy men t increased sharply
among Negroes, especially women,
while the jobless rate for white workers
remained low and unchanged, the
government said Monday in reporting a
slowdown in job growth in April.
The unemployment rate for
nonwhites, mostly Negroes, rose nearly
1 per cent to 6.9 per cent. The rate for
white workers remained at 3.1 percent,
said the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Most of this rise reflected increased
unemployment among nonwhite
women, whose jobless rate moved from

6 per cent to 7.2 per cent," the report
said.
Labor and civil rights groups have
expressed fears that the Nixon
administration's policies to slow the
economy in an effort to cool inflation
would boost unemployment,
particularly among unskilled Negroes.
Harold Goldstein, assistant
commissioner of the bureau, said the
government's goal is to ease the sharpest
rate of inflation in 18 years without a
sharp cut in economic growth, but he
conceded the two are connected.
• Arabs Not Ready For War
JERUSALEM (AP)-The Arabs are
not prepared for a full-scale war with
Israel, Prime Minister Golda Meir
declared Monday, but she added that
Israeli armed forces are ready if she is
wrong.
"Occasionally our region is portrayed
as being on the point of an explosion
which may spread beyond this area,"
Mrs. Meir said in a State of the Union
message to the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.
"There is no jusitfication for this
contention, We live in this region and
we are perfectly familiar with the actual
state of affairs.
"Israel cannot permit herself to err in
her evaluation of the situation or
underestimate the gravity of the
dangers, no can it exaggerate them. We
have learned not to create pipe dreams.
"To the best of our judgment the
Arab countries cannot at the present
permit themselves to wage a total war."
• Constitutional Convention
WASHINGTON (AP)-Action by only
one more state legislature is necessary to
kick off a king-sized dispute in Congress
over the Supreme Court's one-man,
one-vote rulings.
The legislatures of 33 states now are

listed as calling on Congress to convene
a constitutional convention, one short
of the required two-thirds.
Senate Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, spearheading the
drive, said Monday he expects a 34th
state to join the move soon.
"We're working on it,"he told a
reporter, but he declined to say which
state legislature he is counting on.
Aides of Dirksen said it appears the
number of state legislatures petitioning
for a convention to draft a
constitutional amendment to undo the
Supreme Court rulings may reach 38
this year.
The lowa legislature became the 33rd
last week.
This prompted Sen. Joseph D.
Tydings, D-Md., to issue a statement
Monday saying "If one more state calls
for a constitutional convention, we
could face a constitutional crisis
unparalleled in the history of the
Republic."

LONDON (AP)—Prime Minister
Harold Wilson confidently forecast
Monday British entry into an enlarged
Common Market, declaring this would
"open the road to a Europe" united and
strong.
A week after Charles de Gaulle's
departure as French president, Wilson's
aides moved into informal talks with
key continental statesmen here to
celebrate the 20th anniversary of the
Council of Europe;.
Addressing the assembly of
diplomats and politicians who had heard
Queen Elizabeth II formally open the

frustrations and disappointments we
have had to suffer.
"It certainly will not weaken

PARIS (AP)—An attempt by
France's left wing to run a unity
presidential candidate against Goerges
Pompidou dissolved Monday,
strengthening the former premier's
position as front runner in elections
June 1 to pick a successor to Charles de
Gaulle.
The Communist party, the New
Socialist party and the Unified Socialist
party, each nominated men to oppose
Pompidou after failing to agree on a
joint candidate.
The Communists dug deep into their
stable of old war horses to pick Jacques
Duclos, a 72-year-old senator, as their
nominee. Earlier in the day, the
Socialists had named Gaston Defferre,
mayor of Marseille. And late Sunday the
Unified Socialist Party, a small extreme
left group, nominated Michel Rocard,
39-year-old civil servant.
The left wing seemed disoriented and
floating. Rather than issuing a fighting
declaration, Duclos said pessimistically:
"The Frenchmen and women who voted
'no' on April 27 hoped for an alliance
on the basis of defined policy. This
union alone would have permitted the
defeat of Pompidou but the Socialist
party did not hesitate to take the
responsibility for refusing such a
union."
• Black Unemployment
WASHINGTON ( A P ) -
U nem ploy men t increased sharply
among Negroes, especially women,
while the jobless rate for white workers
remained low and unchanged, the
government said Monday in reporting a
slowdown in job growth in April.
The unemployment rate for
nonwhites, mostly Negroes, rose nearly
1 per cent to 6.9 per cent. The rate for
white workers remained at 3.1 percent,
said the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Most of this rise reflected increased
unemployment among nonwhite
women, whose jobless rate moved from

6 per cent to 7.2 per cent," the report
said.
Labor and civil rights groups have
expressed fears that the Nixon
administration's policies to slow the
economy in an effort to cool inflation
would boost unemployment,
particularly among unskilled Negroes.
Harold Goldstein, assistant
commissioner of the bureau, said the
government's goal is to ease the sharpest
rate of inflation in 18 years without a
sharp cut in economic growth, but he
conceded the two are connected.
• Arabs Not Ready For War
JERUSALEM (AP)-The Arabs are
not prepared for a full-scale war with
Israel, Prime Minister Golda Meir
declared Monday, but she added that
Israeli armed forces are ready if she is
wrong.
"Occasionally our region is portrayed
as being on the point of an explosion
which may spread beyond this area,"
Mrs. Meir said in a State of the Union
message to the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.
"There is no jusitfication for this
contention, We live in this region and
we are perfectly familiar with the actual
state of affairs.
"Israel cannot permit herself to err in
her evaluation of the situation or
underestimate the gravity of the
dangers, no can it exaggerate them. We
have learned not to create pipe dreams.
"To the best of our judgment the
Arab countries cannot at the present
permit themselves to wage a total war."
• Constitutional Convention
WASHINGTON (AP)-Action by only
one more state legislature is necessary to
kick off a king-sized dispute in Congress
over the Supreme Court's one-man,
one-vote rulings.
The legislatures of 33 states now are

listed as calling on Congress to convene
a constitutional convention, one short
of the required two-thirds.
Senate Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, spearheading the
drive, said Monday he expects a 34th
state to join the move soon.
"We're working on it,"he told a
reporter, but he declined to say which
state legislature he is counting on.
Aides of Dirksen said it appears the
number of state legislatures petitioning
for a convention to draft a
constitutional amendment to undo the
Supreme Court rulings may reach 38
this year.
The lowa legislature became the 33rd
last week.
This prompted Sen. Joseph D.
Tydings, D-Md., to issue a statement
Monday saying "If one more state calls
for a constitutional convention, we
could face a constitutional crisis
unparalleled in the history of the
Republic."

PARIS (AP)—An attempt by
France's left wing to run a unity
presidential candidate against Goerges
Pompidou dissolved Monday,
strengthening the former premier's
position as front runner in elections
June 1 to pick a successor to Charles de
Gaulle.
The Communist party, the New
Socialist party and the Unified Socialist
party, each nominated men to oppose
Pompidou after failing to agree on a
joint candidate.
The Communists dug deep into their
stable of old war horses to pick Jacques
Duclos, a 72-year-old senator, as their
nominee. Earlier in the day, the
Socialists had named Gaston Defferre,
mayor of Marseille. And late Sunday the
Unified Socialist Party, a small extreme
left group, nominated Michel Rocard,
39-year-old civil servant.
The left wing seemed disoriented and
floating. Rather than issuing a fighting
declaration, Duclos said pessimistically:
"The Frenchmen and women who voted
'no' on April 27 hoped for an alliance
on the basis of defined policy. This
union alone would have permitted the
defeat of Pompidou but the Socialist
party did not hesitate to take the
responsibility for refusing such a
union."
• Black Unemployment
WASHINGTON ( A P ) -
U nem ploy men t increased sharply
among Negroes, especially women,
while the jobless rate for white workers
remained low and unchanged, the
government said Monday in reporting a
slowdown in job growth in April.
The unemployment rate for
nonwhites, mostly Negroes, rose nearly
1 per cent to 6.9 per cent. The rate for
white workers remained at 3.1 percent,
said the Bureau of Labor Statistics.
"Most of this rise reflected increased
unemployment among nonwhite
women, whose jobless rate moved from

6 per cent to 7.2 per cent," the report
said.
Labor and civil rights groups have
expressed fears that the Nixon
administration's policies to slow the
economy in an effort to cool inflation
would boost unemployment,
particularly among unskilled Negroes.
Harold Goldstein, assistant
commissioner of the bureau, said the
government's goal is to ease the sharpest
rate of inflation in 18 years without a
sharp cut in economic growth, but he
conceded the two are connected.
• Arabs Not Ready For War
JERUSALEM (AP)-The Arabs are
not prepared for a full-scale war with
Israel, Prime Minister Golda Meir
declared Monday, but she added that
Israeli armed forces are ready if she is
wrong.
"Occasionally our region is portrayed
as being on the point of an explosion
which may spread beyond this area,"
Mrs. Meir said in a State of the Union
message to the Knesset, Israel's
parliament.
"There is no jusitfication for this
contention, We live in this region and
we are perfectly familiar with the actual
state of affairs.
"Israel cannot permit herself to err in
her evaluation of the situation or
underestimate the gravity of the
dangers, no can it exaggerate them. We
have learned not to create pipe dreams.
"To the best of our judgment the
Arab countries cannot at the present
permit themselves to wage a total war."
• Constitutional Convention
WASHINGTON (AP)-Action by only
one more state legislature is necessary to
kick off a king-sized dispute in Congress
over the Supreme Court's one-man,
one-vote rulings.
The legislatures of 33 states now are

listed as calling on Congress to convene
a constitutional convention, one short
of the required two-thirds.
Senate Republican Leader Everett M.
Dirksen of Illinois, spearheading the
drive, said Monday he expects a 34th
state to join the move soon.
"We're working on it,"he told a
reporter, but he declined to say which
state legislature he is counting on.
Aides of Dirksen said it appears the
number of state legislatures petitioning
for a convention to draft a
constitutional amendment to undo the
Supreme Court rulings may reach 38
this year.
The lowa legislature became the 33rd
last week.
This prompted Sen. Joseph D.
Tydings, D-Md., to issue a statement
Monday saying "If one more state calls
for a constitutional convention, we
could face a constitutional crisis
unparalleled in the history of the
Republic."
