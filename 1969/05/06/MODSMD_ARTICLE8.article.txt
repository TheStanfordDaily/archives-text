# Is Bob Biased?

### 
In May, it is easy to forget at Stanford.
The afternoon sun is hot and draws out
the lethargy in a man. The evenings are
cool, the sunsets dazzling, and there is a
stillness in the air. It is a time for walking,
thinking and peaceful conversation.
The concerns of the world and the
campus seem unduly busy and hectic why
can't people relax? The tension of April
easily vanishes and sit-ins, even shattered
glass, become blurry images.
Yet there are many at Stanford who
cannot forget because they are no longer
the same. It is readily said that members of
the April 3rd Movement have a new moral
urgency and a profound commitment, that
they have become people who act on their
beliefs.
It can be said that more people believe
in humanity at Stanford today than in any
past May, and that these people will never
lose the drive to make the world a better
place.
But what about the people at Stanford
who have been hurt in the past month?
Forgetting is most difficult for these,
remembering is most painful.
In the rush of crisis some people are
trampled. Movements that plead for more
humanity in Vietnam and the Stanford
Board room, should show a sense of
humanity in its actions and statements.

When such intent fails, the victims are not
difficult to identify.
Robert W. Beyers is one. The Movement
calls him Bob "Bias" Beyers and dispenses
with his activities as "news management"
and worse. From their propaganda, Beyers
appears as fascism incarnate and the puppet
of the evil Stanford administration.
Wrong, on all fronts. The Stanford News
Service, which Beyers heads, stands in a
class by itself for honesty and fairness.
There is no other university news service
that gives a paragraph to students. Beyers
gives pages. If he is to be criticized, it is
only because he is a liberal and does not
throw open his presses for propaganda.
During the wild days of April, Beyers
made mistakes. Everyone did. But he was
vilified. Those who know Bob Beyers
cannot believe his energy and commitment
to giving students a fair treatment. He lives
with a sense of humanity rather than
talking about it.
Beyer's job is a next to impossible
assignment-to be a newspaperman
employed by the newsmaker, or one side of
the newsmaker. Should anyone doubt his
integrity, or that of his associate Harry
Press, the latest Observer is comprehensive
testimony to fair coverage.
The alumni will blow their minds.
Beyers may be in real trouble now.
