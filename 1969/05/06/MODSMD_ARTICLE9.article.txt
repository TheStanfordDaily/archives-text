## Baha'i Affords Alternative 
### Kamal Zein KAMAL ZEIN 
It is revolutionary ideas,
technological and scientific
progress, wars, racial animosity
and prejudices of many sorts
which characterize our century. It
is man's privilege and need to
work for a better world in the
context, and to strive for the
establishment of a society with
justice and love as its foundation.
In committing ourselves to the
improvement of man's condition
we soon discover the necessity to
work within institutions that can
implement our beliefs. It is
important to see with clarity
which of the many organizations
can best achieve our aims. Some
choose to fight the system, others
strive to be good and worship
God, and others strive simply for
awareness. There is another
alternative in which I believe, and
is of such great import that I feel 1
should discuss it at this time.
This alternative consists of a
belief, principles, a system, a
purpose—known the world over as
the Baha'i Faith. Were I to
mention that the Baha'i Faith is a
religion that believes in God and
the Oneness of Man some readers
might discontinue further reading.
In the Baha'i context "religion
is the outer expression of the
divine reality," and a divine
reality implies a force we call
God. The Baha'i Faith teaches
that religion is One and
Progressive, and is the source of
good, for if the essence of religion
were otherwise then religion
would be of no value to man. The
coming into existence of the Bah'i
Faith is part of the evolution of
religion, not man-made religion,
but divine religion: only
individual investigation coupled
with sincerity to find the truth of
the matter can prove my claim.
Answer Clear
The moans for achieving the
unity of mankind varies in
people's minds but in the Baha'i
writings the answer is clear and
fundamental only through the
spiritual unity of men can
universal peace be brought about,
for it is man's heart and basic
beliefs that must be revived and
purified.
It is this alternative that
Malcolm X believed was the only
solution left for America. In his
autobiography he says that ". . . if
white America could accept the
Oneness of God, then perhaps,
too, they could accept in reality
the Oneness of Man" and further

says that the younger generation
of students will see the
handwriting in the wall, and many
"will turn to the spiritual path of
truth—the only way left to
American to ward off the disaster
that racism inevitably must lead
to." (p. 341)
An understanding of the
Oneness of God and the Oneness
of Man, is not sufficient to effect
changes in this world: wo have to
believe in this Oneness, make it a
concrete goal in our lives, and not
merely a part-time interest or a
scholarly pursuit. It means that
we live according to our belief.
This is my belief and it is only
through an institution that
upholds and practices these
underlying truths, the Oneness of
God and the Onness of Man, that
I can best serve the goal of uniting
mankind.
Remedy
It is essential to consider the
remedy that the Baha'i teachings
have to offer to a dying world. We
cannot dismiss the teachings in
the light that they are religious,
and therefore unworkable.
Religion has become a word with
bad connotations because many
blunders have been committed in
its name and religion has not
solved man's problems. However
the Baha'i writings state that it is
only man's abuse of religion that
is at the source of this criticism
and not religion itself.
In this day the Baha'i teachings
offer a solution for a peaceful
society, in which man is free of
prejudice; this day is of
paramount importance for man
should not be proud that he
belongs to this or that country
but that he is a citizen of the
world.
Baha'is are united by the bond
of love, love of God and mankind.
Within the teachings each
individual is responsible only to
God and has the privilege to
investigate the truth for himself.
Other Baha'i principles such as the
equality of man and woman, the
spiritual solution to the economic
problems, the necessity of an
auxiliary universal language, the
essential harmony of science and
religion, the universal compulsory
education, a universal peace
upheld by a world government, all
were enunciated bv Baha'u'llah,
the prophet of the Bah'i Faith,
over a century ago and are now
slowly being recognized in our
world

Bah'u'llah was ex* iled and
imprisoned because of these
principles, for over forty years,
yet the propagation of his
teachings have reached remote
lands. At present there are Baha'i
communities in every country of
the world. It is a wonder when we
reflect on the Baha'i history that a
single man, in chains most of His
life has been able to communicate
so extensively divine teachings
that aim at the establishment of a
new world order.
To be sure the transition from
this world order to tHr new

will not be smooth, but the Baha'i
Faith stands as a strong and
concrete hope for the future and
as an alternative to those
individuals who believe that the
world can be changed and need to
be changed, and are not
discouraged by the gigantic and
seemingly insurmountable
obstacles that face them.

Baha'i viewpoint further please
