# SJC To Continue Inquiry Of Sit-Ins
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
Prosecution of the demonstrators
who sat in at the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL) has not been
discontinued, although the tidal wave of
legal proceedings since the sit-in at
Encina Hall has pushed all action on the
earlier cases into the background.
"We must give precedence to those
who have been suspended," commented
Law Professor Jack Friedenthal,
chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC).
"The AEL case is not dead,"
Friedenthal added. "We have been
investigating and gathering names."
As of last night, a total of five
suspended students from Encina had
brought their cases to the SJC for
review. One case is slated for hearing
Thursday, three for today and one
decision has already been reached.
According to Friedenthal, the decision
was, in effect, an acquittal: lifting the
suspension of one student who was not
involved.
AEL Question "Fuzzy"
"This case (Encina) will probably
sweep up most of those in the AEL,"
Friedenthal stated. He estimated that
thirty or forty names of AEL

demonstrators had been gathered. "The
question of AEL is much fuzzier; we
must talk about those clearly in
violation."
Friedenthal explained that if a
student bringing his case up for review
before the SJC pleads guilty and agrees
to a "dialogue," the council will
consider the whole range of problems.
If, however, a student wishes to be
prosecuted separately on the two
violations, AEL and Encina, Friedenthal
indicated that punitive action would
probably be cumulative.
Friedenthal emphasized the
difficulty of ascertaining those clearly
in violation of the campus policy on
disruptions in the AEL case, since many
professors, students and University staff
members who were not taking jiart in
the sit-in went to AEL to talk with the
demonstrators.
Seventeen Signatures
A request for prosecution of those
demonstrators does not, as the Daily
reported earlier, have forty signatures
on it. There are only seventeen
signatures on the document, but Prof.
Friedenthal was given to understand,
when he received the document, that
over forty people were willing to sign it.
The request was apparently filed by
people who work in and around AEL.
Friedenthal declined to speculate on
the possibility of delayed prosecution of
the AEL demonstrators taking place
next Fall, should the Encina
proceedings continue to tie up the SJC
until the end of the year. He explained
that a new council will have been
instituted at that time, and that he
could make no prediction about their
actions.
He did state, however, that
proceedings against those AEL
demonstrators who have not left
Stanford would be possible next year.
The charter for the present Judicial
Council, which replaced the Interim
Judicial Body, was drawn up during the
sit-in at the Old Student Union last
year. The SJC is a nine-member body
composed of four faculty and four
student members, with a faculty
chairman who votes only in case of ties.
All members of the SJC serve a one-year
term.
