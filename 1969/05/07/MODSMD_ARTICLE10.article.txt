As the dust clears and the tension of
past weeks relaxes, it is possible to realize
that in the midst of sit-ins a continual flow
of information is critical to avoid chaos.
KZSU was the key to immediate
information flow during the recent sit-ins.
The radio station's performance was
miraculous. With a small staff and less than
ultra-modern or mobile equipment, KZSU
was at every important meeting or
demonstration. The usual format was to air
the speeches and discussions of the April
3rd Movement, interjecting background or
new information.
It was quite possible to follow the
action without stepping out of one's room.
It may be that too many people relied on
KZSU to the exclusion of seeing and
feeling by attending Movement meetings.
KZSU proved, with more evidence than
we care to think, that newspaper
journalism and its 30 ton presses cannot
quite keep up with a fast breaking story.
