# The
						Movement
## Revolution By Affinity 
### Michael Sweeney 
The most revolutionary idea to
come out of the April 3rd
Movement is "affinity" groups.
These close-knit groups are
revolutionary because they give
politics an intensely personal
meaning. They are the logical
organizational unit for a
Movement that has rejected
organization, hierarchy,
demagorgery, and all the other
crap that entraps an idealistic
impulse in a bureaucratic mire.
The affinity groups have
evolved gradually over the last
month. At the AEL sit-in, the
large community meetings would
occasionally break into small
groups to talk over an issue. This
approach gave everyone a chance
to contribute his own thoughts
and get some feedback.
For the better-known radicals
in the Movement, Paul Rupert and
David Pugh for example, the small
groups were one important means
of avoiding a leadership cult,
which so often destroys the spirit
of a mass movement.
To the silent and less
committed students, the small
groups gave them a chance to
discover "where they were at" by
actively formulating and arguing
their own views. Comparatively
few students were eager to speak
at a microphone before a crowd
of 700, but everyone would speak
up in a small group of 1 0 or 15.
The influence of the encounter
or sensitivity group helped shape
the style of these small groups.
Although a long-time SDS
member is a member of almost all
of them, there has been no
attempt to dominate discussion or
thinking by the committed
radicals. Just the opposite is true.
The Movement's new members,
many of them freshmen or
sophomores, are finding in
themselves an ability to initiate
political action.
After the brief, unhappy sit-in
at Encina, the Movement turned
to the small groups as the way to
reunite. The new name "affinity
groups," changed briefly to
"infinity groups," shows the
intensity which they are meant, to
foster.
Last weekend, many of the
affinity groups met at members
homes to talk out the whole range
of issues—how to respond to the
court injunction, how the
demands can be gained, and what
mistakes can be avoided in the
future. People came to know one
another.
Many students were

discouraged and pessimistic about
the Movement when they first
met with an affinity group last
Friday. By yesterday, the high
spirits of the AEL sit-in had been
regained. The willingness to risk
reprisal because of a radical
commitment was found once
more. The special kind of
loneliness that comes from fear
was assuaged by the
companionship of others who
were equally afraid, but equally
determined.
Some signs that the "politics of
joy" were returning to the
Movement were the imaginative
names of the 14 affinity groups
that had been organized Tuesday.
Some examples: "Big Bill
Hewlett's Fragmentation Bomb";
"David Packard Memorial";
"Smash the State"; "Ugly
Americans for Freedom"; and
''David. Starr Jordan
Anti-Imperialist League."
In the past two days, the
affinity groups started becoming
action groups. Big Bill Hewlett's
Fragmentation Bomb, for
instance, trouped over the
President Pitzer's office, and
rapped with him about SRI. Then
the F r ta gmentation Bomb
journeyed to Encina to interview
General Secretary Darvl Pearson.
At Monday night's meeting,
each affinity group made
proposals to the entire Movement
for specific action. Some groups
announced that they would
handle certain projects
themselves, including telephoning
all 1,400 signers of the AEL
Solidarity Statement, setting up a
tent city as Movement
headquarters, and making plans
for a student strike.
Later in the meeting, one
student proposed that all
Movement work be initiated and
carried out in the affinity groups.
His proposal wasn't immediately
adopted, but the Movement
certain seems to be giving the
affinity groups an ever more
important role.
The social and political
significance of the affinity groups
cannot be underrated. The flock
of eager sociology students which
is hovering around the Movement,
searching for good research topics,
should look to these groups as the
institutional template of radical
politics.
At the beginning of this article,
I called the affinity groups the
most revolutionary aspect of the
Movement. Like all
decentralization, small groups give

the individual a greater
opportunity for self-realization.
When the individuals are highly
intelligent Stanford students, this
can lead the unleashing of a
tremendous amount of creative
energy. The same energy would be
lost in the traditional
leader-follower organization. And
groups, as a psychologist will
hasten to add, are proven to tend
toward more risky decision than
individuals.
The affinity groups will also
help sustain the radicalism of the
Movement by putting into
practice some radical
ideology—especially participatory
democracy. There was some
danger that democracy would
break down in the interminable
community meetings. Now a
viable democratic unit is in
operation.

As an alternative to
bureaucratic hierarchies, the
affinity group idea may be an
answer to the psychological
oppression that is typical of our
social institutions. Even in student
organizations at Stanford,
individuals are rebelling against
the irrational patterns of
decision-making that are based on
power, instead of popular
consent.
Affinity groups have an
important symbolism as well in
the larger context of our political
struggle. The real opponents of
the Movement are the Trustees,
who stand at the top of rigid
hierarchies that control much of
the nation's economy. As a Board,
they head an administrative
hierarchy that rules Stanford
through naked power, instead of
popular consent.
