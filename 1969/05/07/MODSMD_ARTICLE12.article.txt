## What Happened To The April 3rd Movement? 
### 
Kditor, TIIE DAILY:
Whatever happenedto the April
3rd Movement I met at A.E.L.
and the community exchange of
ideas, the exposure to radically
different viewpoints that stabbed
Stanford's complacency over war
research?
In the hours of discussion last
Wednesday, before and after the
Trustee's meeting, at Tresidder
and Dinkelspiel I felt a very
different atmosphere. It seemed
that no the "leadership" but the
people there had pre-decided that,
when the Trustees lived up to
their expectations, that a Sit-In
would be a matter of course (after
token discussion), an expression
of righteous indignation.
At the post-Trustee meeting
this element seemed impatient
with the formalities of discussion
that attempted, but never came
close to establishing the link
between this tactic and the
accomplishment of their goals.

Proposals to wait for decisions of
the academic council, Trustees,
and others and thus make their
militant action a reply to
"inaction" (a much sounder
position tactically and morally)
were received with obvious
impatience. In fact so many
seemed to be bored by the
verbosity at the 4:30 meeting and
left that if they hadn't adjourned
it would have been difficult to
vote.
The impression that some
elements were "up for it"and
beginning to feel there had been
enough justifying debate was
more pronounced at Tresidder, as
were the number of cliche type
responses, slogans and prejudice
toward other tactics that rose
sharply, despite the efforts of the
chair to regain community spirit.
A.E.L.'s open mindedness was
very far away.
One of the most encouraging
things about the April 3rd

Movement had been its focus on
the issues, the relevance of the
issues and their appropriate
tactics; it was unique. The few
that broke into Encina were
considerably less than the 1300
on A.E.L.'s solidarity list and,
except for the dedicated radicals,
seemed to be playing ego games.
Unfortunately they dragged down
the name that once applied to a
much larger group of people and a
much bigger idea.
I hope the machinery started at
A.E.L. wasn't stopped at Encina,
but now the focus on April 3 has
changed. We shouldn't let it
overshadow the real issues.

•We Support
Kditor, THE DAILY:
We regret the illegal and
indefensible occupation of Encina
Hall by students of the April
Third Coalition, an act which was
in clear violation of the guidelines
set up by the Stanford Judicial
Council. We fully support your
decision of bringing in outside
police to end this occupation.
We hope that you will
not hesitate to call in outside
police again when illegal and
coercive student action makes this
mandatory.

•Far-Fetched
Editor. THE DAILY:
The April Third Movement's
attempt to educate its members
and its audience during the AEL
sit-in resulted in some rather
far-fetched allegations. To take
just one instance, one which
concerns my own research, the
work on electromagnetic
propagation includes a topic
called transhorizon microwave
propagation. This topic was
alleged to involve ABM radars.
Any such allegation is not only
false; it is ridiculous. The
propagation phonemena involved
are well nigh useless in radar
applicat ions.
T ra nshorizon microwave
propagation finds practical
application in two principal areas:
communications and signal
monitoring. Both areas have
military applications. Both have
equally important civilian

applications. Our work does not
deal with either application. It
deals with the basic propagation
phenomenon itself—the manner in
which electromagnetic waves are
affected by the air through which
they pass. Although supported by
a so-called "classified" contract,
the work i tsel f—equipment,
theory, data—is basically
unclassified. Results end up as
published journal articles. In
recent years two students have
obtained Stanford PhD's in this
field, and a third hopes to
soon—provided the "harmless"
AEL disruption has not ruined his
chances.

•Please Write
Editor, THE DAILY:
There are nine Senators in
Washington who hold the balance
of power on President Nixon's
Safeguard Anti-Ballistic Missile
system, due for its first Senate
floor test at the end of May. They
are undecided about how to vote
on ABM and will be responsive to
letters, telegrams and postcards.
Since this will be an extremely
close vote, I urge those members
of the Stanford community who
are opposed to the Safeguard
system to write to these men as
often as possible in the few
remaining weeks left before the
Senate vote.
Their names are: Warren G.
Magnuson, John J. Williams,
Theodore F. Stevens, Len B.
Jordon, Robert W. Packwood,
Robert P. Griffin, William B.
Spong, Jr., Hiram L. Fong, J.
Caleb Boggs. Their address is
Senate Office Building,
Washington, D C. 20510.

•Disgusted
Editor, THF. DAILY:
I cease to be amazed by your
deliberate biased reporting of the
news; I am disgusted! In your
front page article of Thursday,
May 1, entitled "Students Stage
Walkout at Trustee Hearing in
UGLY" you presented ONE SIDE
of student opinion very heavily
(three to one in favor of your
side), promising in an editor's
note to present the other side in
"tomorrow's" (Friday, May 2)
Daily. That was bad enough. Then
the information did not appear as
promised, but only presented
statements from two of the f(7ur
speakers.
The fact that you have much
to include in each edition of the
Daily is no excuse for this
deliberate biasing of the news.
One could overlook this as an
honest mistake if it were a unique
happening, but I have seen
evidence that it is a continuous
process. This is a problem of
major concern to a large segment
of the community, and must
come to an end.

In view of the possibility that
some of the suspended students
may be among those attending my
lectures, my classes will be held
on the lawn behind mathematics
corner until further notice.
