## American Students Abroad 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
The image of the American student
abroad is a complete antithesis of
"The Ugly American" that
William Lederer describes in his
best seller. He represents many of
the values that the founding
fathers of this country cherished
and what the rest of the world has
always associated with the New
World.
The American student abroad
does not come from what is
ambiguously called the silent
majority. He is very articulate;
often he is an activist. He also is
an idealist. The issues that his
fellow American students protest
against at home, he does with
same enthusiasm abroad. When

ex-defense secretary Mr.
McNamara visited New Delhi last
year, all the eighteen American
students at Delhi University
picketed him at the American
Embassy. American students took
a prominent part in the recent
Peace March in London and the
take-over of the London School
of Economics as a protest against
the war in South East Asia. In
fact, their actions were so
precipitative that the dean of the
London School of Economics
charged the American students,
who form about one tenth of the
student body, with creating
disorder and disturbance.
The American student abroad

has many of the characteristics
that makes one likable in a foreign
country. He seldom symbolises
the enormous wealth and power
that his country enjoys. He is not
inhibited and tends to go native.
It is not uncommon to find
American students and peace
corps workers in underdeveloped
countries riding bicycles in he
scorching heat, traversing long
distances on foot or sporting the
native dress. Fifty American
students were sponsored last year
by the Volunteers In Asia (VIA),
a Stanford based organization, to
spend a summer or six months in
several South East Asian
countries. They enjoyed a very
cordial relationship with the
native people whose shacks they
shared, and with whom they
worked in the hospitals, clinics
and in community development
projects.
The fact that most of the
American students abroad come
from the field of humanities and
social sciences, makes their
adjustment to foreign culture
rather easy, unlike the engineers
or scientists who have no or little
background in humanities. Out of
the nearly 22,000 American
students abroad, 50 percent are
studying humanities and about 13
percent social sciences. The
number of students abroad in the
field of engineering and sciences is
insignificant.
Few to Africa
More than 57 percent of the
American students abroad are in
Europe, 14 percent in Asia, Latin
America has 11 percent, less than
one percent in Africa and the rest
in North America. The number of
students going to Asia and Africa
is painfully low. Transportation
costs are a major factor, but there
are others such as language,
culture and standard of living. In
all fairness, one must accept the
plain fact that it is much easier to
adjust to a higher standard of

living than to a lower one. Besides
there is not much that Asia or
Africa has to offer to an outsider
at this moment of history. The
only institute in Asia which has
attracted a large number of
Americans is Maharishi Mahesh
Yogi's (guru of Mia Farrow and
Beatles) transcendental
meditation academy, situated
deep in the Himalayas in India.
There is hardly any other
group of Americans that has done
more to project the American
ideals to the rest of the world
than the American students
abroad.
