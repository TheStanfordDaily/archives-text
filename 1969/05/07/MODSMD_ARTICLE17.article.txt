## Support The CAC 
### Lewis H. Gann 
I should like to express my
support for the Coalition for an
Academic Community and for the
sentiments expressed in your
reprint of Professor John Searle's
article "Tactics are Important."
I feel, however, that Professor
Searle has not gone far enough in
his analysis. The present campus
campaign owes a great deal to the
revivalist and millenarian
tradition, which is so deeply
ingrained in this country, and
which I myself, detest with all my
heart. Whatever the militants'
personal beliefs may be, they have
the same sense of personal
holiness as the ancient "Saints,"
the "Elect," the "Preserved."
They likewise have the same
contempt for the unregenerate
sinners, the "Sons of Belial," the
"sprigs to be plucked from the
burning." There is the same
emotionalism, the same contempt
for rational discourse. There are
the same hopes for a Second
Coming, when sin and suffering
will all suddenly wane from this
world, when the Kingdom of
Heaven will be established here
and now.
One can—in my opinion—speak
of a new and very objectionable
neoclericalism which centers on
the Campuses. The believers assert
for themselves "immunity of
clergy," just like the medieval
clergymen who insisted that they
should not be tried by secular
courts, but only by Church
courts. (I admit that the parallel
has certain weaknesses.)
Medieval churchmen were
dedicated—at least in theory—to
poverty, chastity and obedience,
virtues which make little appeal to
the "New Left." But the "New
Left" also demand for Campuses a

kind of extra-territorial status,
which has much in common with
the right of sanctuary claimed by
medieval churchmen for their
places of worship.
Professor Searle makes
comparisons with the McCarthy
era. He does not, however, go far
enough. I do not simply refer to
the fact that in the McCarthy era
there were no physical threats
against dissidents; professional
offices were not occupied by
militants; manuscripts were not
stolen or destoryed. I refer rather
to more basic issues. The "New
Left" adherents are in many ways
American great-power chauvinists
turned inside out. They assume
that nothing can conceivably
happen in this world without
American participation or
connivance.
Wars and commotions would
all cease, if only ' Washington
would speak a mighty word. As a
European, I naturally cannot
share this assumption. I likewise
do not share the old-style
isolationists' belief that none
would dare to attack this country,
much less succeed in occupying it.
The peoples of Eastern Europe are
just as tough and numerous as the
Americans. But lacking arms and
unity, they have been repeatedly
occupied by more powerful
neighbors.
A disarmed America would, in
my opinion, be quite likely to
share the fate of Czechoslovakia
or Tibet. Conversely,
Czechoslovakia would never have
been occupied by the Red Army,
if the Czechs had owned their
own hydrogen bombs.
