# "Romeo And Juliet"
## Mom Goes To The Movies 
### Cissie Bonini 
A new movie playing in San
Francisco is a sequel to "West
Side Story" called "Romeo and
Juliet." (Although the name is
Italian, there are no sub-titles. The
translation from the Italian is a
little awkward and must have
been done by someone with only
a classical English background.
However, one can overlook a few
"forsooths" in the interest of a
good story.)
Raymond and Julie (might as
well use English all the way) are
two young people who are very
fond of each other although their
parents don't get along too well.
(Evidently because the Capulets
have better-looking robes and caps
and stuff than the Montagues, and
you know how the French are
about fashion!)
Anyway, the plot centers
around a beverage that a monky
friend of theirs makes to banish
acne in adolescents. The film
should really be sub-titled "You
Are What You Eat" or "People
Under Eighteen Shouldn't Drink"
because this beverage is really the
pits. This comes as no surprise to
the viewer because the monky
friend made t out of dandelions

and old ragweed or something
all through the film he is picking
baskets of weeds but you never
see him checking-them against his
botany book. (All of which proves
the advantages of a scientific
education over a continental one.)
N ear-Sighted
Julie is near-sighted but is
evidently too vain to wear glasses.
For example, she spends a lot of
time looking around for Romeo
("Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art
thou, my Romeo") when any fool
can see he's about two feet away,
for God's sake, and right directly
under her balcony.
Anyway, they finally grope

their way to each other (he's a
bookish type and doesn't see to
well, either) and it is very
romantic and sweet (after he finds
her mouth-first he hits the
eyebrow, then chin, etc.)
In the next scene, Julie is lying
around in a depressing atmosphere
with a lot of relatives who are
evidently on strong drugs. They're
really out like lights which is a
disgraceful way for older people
to behave around the young, but
we mustn't judge. Raymond is
angry when he discovers that Julie
has finished off all the sauce and
the monk with the "grass" took
off when he thought the

authorities were en route. (Never
trust a priest who's a pusher.)
Raymond lias no needle with him,
so he uses a sword, and has a
really bad trip. Julie comes out of
her trance, sees Raymond lying
around on the floor instead of
contributing to the gross national
product of Verona, and decides to
end it all.
The story doesn't have much
depth, but the costumes are
pretty and the idea is certainly
avant-garde. There's a nice dance
scene, too, although it never really
swings. I predict good things for
this English playwright,
Shakespeare. Hut I think he would
be more successful if he would
deal with some of the deeper
questions of life.
After all, there have been so
many T.V. specials on narcotics

little awkward and must have
been done by someone with only
a classical English background.
However, one can overlook a few
"forsooths" in the interest of a
good story.)
Raymond and Julie (might as
well use English all the way) are
two young people who are very
fond of each other although their
parents don't get along too well.
(Evidently because the Capulets
have better-looking robes and caps
and stuff than the Montagues, and
you know how the French are
about fashion!)
Anyway, the plot centers
around a beverage that a monky
friend of theirs makes to banish
acne in adolescents. The film
should really be sub-titled "You
Are What You Eat" or "People
Under Eighteen Shouldn't Drink"
because this beverage is really the
pits. This comes as no surprise to
the viewer because the monky
friend made t out of dandelions

and old ragweed or something
all through the film he is picking
baskets of weeds but you never
see him checking-them against his
botany book. (All of which proves
the advantages of a scientific
education over a continental one.)
N ear-Sighted
Julie is near-sighted but is
evidently too vain to wear glasses.
For example, she spends a lot of
time looking around for Romeo
("Romeo, Romeo, wherefore art
thou, my Romeo") when any fool
can see he's about two feet away,
for God's sake, and right directly
under her balcony.
Anyway, they finally grope

their way to each other (he's a
bookish type and doesn't see to
well, either) and it is very
romantic and sweet (after he finds
her mouth-first he hits the
eyebrow, then chin, etc.)
In the next scene, Julie is lying
around in a depressing atmosphere
with a lot of relatives who are
evidently on strong drugs. They're
really out like lights which is a
disgraceful way for older people
to behave around the young, but
we mustn't judge. Raymond is
angry when he discovers that Julie
has finished off all the sauce and
the monk with the "grass" took
off when he thought the

authorities were en route. (Never
trust a priest who's a pusher.)
Raymond lias no needle with him,
so he uses a sword, and has a
really bad trip. Julie comes out of
her trance, sees Raymond lying
around on the floor instead of
contributing to the gross national
product of Verona, and decides to
end it all.
The story doesn't have much
depth, but the costumes are
pretty and the idea is certainly
avant-garde. There's a nice dance
scene, too, although it never really
swings. I predict good things for
this English playwright,
Shakespeare. Hut I think he would
be more successful if he would
deal with some of the deeper
questions of life.
After all, there have been so
many T.V. specials on narcotics
A new movie playing in San
Francisco is a sequel to "West
Side Story" called "Romeo and
Juliet." (Although the name is
Italian, there are no sub-titles. The
translation from the Italian is a
little awkward and must have
been done by someone with only
a classical English background.
