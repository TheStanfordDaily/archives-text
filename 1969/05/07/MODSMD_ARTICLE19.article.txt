## A3M "Meow" 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Campus radicals, you are both
hypocrites and cowards. You
suggest that the immorality of the
Trustee's inaction is so great that
you can justify violence, useless
physical damage, and ignoring the
rights of others; yet, this
immorality is not great enough to
make you stick your necks out
and personally lace suspension
and arrest, if need be.
Confrontation Ls the name of
your game. You selected these
tactics but you will not accept
that facing the consequences of
your action (arrests, suspensions,
etc.) is an essential part of the
tactics of confrontation. The
purpose of a sit-in is not just to
disrupt some university activity
but to focus attention and gain
support for your position.
1300 students being tried by
the S.JC would seem to be a
perfect tactic for focusing
attention. If you think that the
SJC is a stooge for the
administration, then your only
alternative, if you really believe in
confrontation, is to get arrested.
By your decisions to not give
your names, to not allow cameras,
and to withdraw when confronted
with force, you make it clear that
civil disobedience is not your
"thing." It takes guts and
conviction to put your body on
the line. You should change your
tactics since you have neither the

support nor the guts to follow
through in a confrontation
situation.
The Stanford Administration is
too smart for you. They always
give you an out—a chance to
escape the consequences of your
actions.. Campus radicals, I have
just one thing to say to
you—"meow."

It seems an odd coincidence
that my new typewriter
disappeared on the same night as
Encina was occupied. How does
the A3IVI relate such apparent
theft with their vaunted high
moral principles?
