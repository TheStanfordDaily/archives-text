# Trustee's Son Busted
## 
### 
Harrison Minge Brown, student
and son of Stanford Trustee
Robert M. Brown, was arrested
Sunday by Santa Clara County
police for possession of marijuana.
Young Brown allegedly offered
singer O.C. Smith a joint at the
recent pop concert in Frost
Amphitheater. Smith declined the
offer rather loudly over the
microphone and the police moved
in.
Brown recently publicly
denounced his father's
involvement in the court
proceedings leveled against the
April Third Movement.
