# "Pastoral Picnic" On Mother's Day
## 
### 
In the Australian Gum trees
across from the Staudium there
are going to be Spring Rites this
Sunday, May 11, 10 a.m. to dusk.
The gathering is for the whole
Stanford community and can
either be thought of as a Pastoral
Picnic or Up Against The Wall,
Mother's Day.
Food, Magic, and
Entertainment are the main
offerings of the day. The
Tresidder Memorial Union Board,
who is sponsoring the events,
promises fencers, the Renaissance
Wind Band, magicians, Greek
Dancers, Poets, and Boffers (mock
sword fighters) from the Whole
Earth Trrck Store.
Spontaneous activites will also
be encouraged so board member
Ted Loring urges all to bring their

recorders, kites, guitars, and belly
dancers to the assemblage.
Chicken barbequed on the spot
will be the main substance of the
day. However, add to this
sandwiches, bread, cheese, apples,
oranges, watermelon, cookies,
tarts, drinks, pickles, and ice
cream, and the meal is complete.
The fare will bo given to the
masses after TMU prices are paid.
Loring summed up the
projected atmosphere of Sunday's
gathering by saying, "People are
invited to come in costume.
People are invited to bring their
mothers, fathers, professors, and
friendsâ€”to be in the sun, or under
the trees, and listen to music, or
make music while eating good
food and enjoying good friends.
