It's "Marathon Weekend" in the Pac-8 baseball season. Starting
Friday all eight teams will open a crucial weekend series that will
include six games in five days, including a pair of doubleheaders on
Saturday and Monday.
The long weekend series will take the four California schools into
the Northwest country, with six of the eight teams still in the thick of
the pennant race.
The four-way log jam for first place was untangled for the moment
last weekend when Stanford and UCLA captured wins over California
and USC respectively in single contests. The Indians and Bruins go
into the Northwest weekend series leading USC and California by one
game and fifth place Oregon State—a winner over rival Oregon last
Saturday—by only two games.
In the previous six-game-in-five-days series no one escaped
unbeaten, and, once again, it will probably be a matter of the pitching
staffs taking command in the Friday through Tuesday contests. The
only games after the long series are a pair of contests with traditional
rivals on May 16 & 17. And this is where the Conference champion
could be crowned.
The Tribe meets Cal once at home and then once in Berkeley to
end the league season. In their only other i -eting of the year,
Stanford clobbered Cal's Tom McAlone winning, 10-4 just last
Saturday.
With the Tribe's strong hurling staff (Rod Poteete, Phil Keller, and
Bob Boore), it would appear that they would have the upper hand
over the long weekend ahead.
But strong pitching is spread throughout the league. UCLA claims
three of the conferences's top mound men, Jim York (0.84 ERA), A 1
Hoops (0.93 ERA), and Rick Pope (1.01 ERA). USC, defending
champions, are not to be left out of the pitching game. Brent Strom is
the ironman of the squad, having worked 38 league innings. He also
has a 4-0 record, 41 strike outs, and 1.47 ERA to show for it.
Stanford's Phil Keller is second on the strikeout list with 40.
Aside from Strom, it has been hitting that has kept the Torjans in
the thick of the race. The top three batters in the Pac-8 are all from
SC: Russ Bennett, (.405), Bill Seinsoth, (.385), and Cal Meier, (.375).
Stanford's slugging third baseman Bob Boone is right behind at a
.366 league clip. Boone is fifth in the league in the important RBI
column with 9, and three home runs. Stanford's always Ail-American,
Mark Marquess ranks as the 15th top hitter at .300.
UCLA's Chris Chambliss has slugged seven homers to date for a
Pac-8 record. In the team batting race, it is obviously the Trojans out
in front with a .270 average. Cal is second at .250, with UCLA and
Oregon next at .246. Stanford is mired down in sixth place hitting
only .220 collectively.
California has been the most consistent hitting club, with 99 hits,
55 runs, and 45 RBl's. Stanford's totals (83 hits, 38 runs, and 33
RBl's) are relatively low for the league, but nevertheless, Coach Ray
Young's men are the leaders.
Pitching is still the name of the game.

Indians in a recent contest. The Tribe broke out of a year long hitting slump last
Saturday against Cal when they exploded for 10 runs.
