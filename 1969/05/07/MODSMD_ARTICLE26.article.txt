## Altitude KO's Tribe 
### 
If Denver is a mile high, the
University of Denver and the Air
Force Academy lacrosse teams
were a mile higher, as the Pioneers
and the Falcons snapped the
Indians' 27 game winning streak
and avenged last year's losses by
convincing 12-4 and 21-2 counts
last weekend.
The altitude noticeably
affected the Tribe, who simply
could not run with the acclimated
and disciplined Rocky Mountain
teams. The Indians went into the
half-time break against Denver on
Saturday trailing only 3-2 and
maintained that same score until 7
minutes were gone in the third
period. Then Stanford pulled up
short of breath and the Pioneers
pulled loose for their biggest win
of the year.
In Sunday's contest at
Colorado Springs, things
happened faster. A thousand feet
higher at the Air Force Academy,
Stanford ran effectively with the
cadets for ten minutes, when the
score was tied 1-1. Then the
Falcons scored three goals in the
remaining five minutes of the
period, and went on to fast-break
the Indians to death.
Chris Rafferty turned a
hattrick for the Indians for their
first three goals in the Denver
contest, while Stu Childs chipped
in the fourth. Leading the scoring

for the Pioneers was Tug Howe, a
rangey fast midfielder, who scored
two goals and two assists and
helped set up several goals.
Against Air Force, Childs and
Ted Suen got the lone Indian
tallies in the first and second
quarters. Just about everyone got
in on the grudge act for the
Falcons, with Bill Taylor and Joe
Dryden leading the charge with 4
goals and 6 assists and 6 goals,
respectively.
