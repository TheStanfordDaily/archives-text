California and Stanford wind
up their spring sports rivalry this
weekend with most attention
focusing on the Big Row.
The rival crews are scheduled
to take to the Oakland Estuary
Saturday.
The frosh race begins at 1:05
p.m. followed by the JVs at 1:25
p.m., varsities at 1:45 p.m.
The Indians were beaten by
UCLA by seven seconds last week.
The Bruins earlier beat Cal by
eight seconds. UC Irvine edged
Stanford by three feet. Cal lost to
Irvine by one foot.
"It's liable to be just that close
in all three races, but I believe
Stanford should be favored
because of its better performance
against Washington," said Cal
Coach Marty McNair.
Cal lost to Washington by eight
lengths over a 2 and three-quarter
miles course in Seattle. The
Huskies beat Stanford at
2,000-meters by only a length two
weeks before.
