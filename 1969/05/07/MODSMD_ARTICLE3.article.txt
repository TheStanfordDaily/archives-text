## ABM Faces Pro, Con Responses 
### 
WASHINGTON [AP]—A report by
two prominent scientists and a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
calls the Safeguard antiballistic missile
ABM system "insurance against war."
It says"it may well be, in fact, the
single most important step the United
States can take toward a real and lasting
peace at this moment in history."
"Antimissile defense is an essential
component in the network of military
systems designed to give the American
people a seamless garment of security in
an age of acute danger," the report says.
The 64-page study, prepared for the
American Security Council, was released
last night.
It was written by Dr. Willard F.
Libby, former Atomic Energy
Commission member and Nobel
Prize-winning chemist; Dr. William J.
Thaler of Georgetown University's
physics department; and retired Gen.
Nathan F. Twining, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Much of the study was devoted to a
comparison of Soviet and U.S. military
efforts and strength. It cited growing
Soviet power and concluded, "The
changed military balance will weaken
Iree world alliance systems and increase
Soviet aggressiveness."
There was little detailed analysis of
the ABM and its components.

WASHINGTON [AP| A 344-page
study commissioned by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy on the Safeguard antiballistic
missile ABM concludes that the system
proposed by the Nixon administration
"cannot perform effectively the
missions suggested for it."
"Our principal conclusion is that
there is no need for a decision to deploy
the Sentinel-Safeguard ABM system at
this time," said the four main authors.
Profs. Abram Chayes of Harvard Law
School and Jerome Wiesner, George
Rathjens and Steven Weinberg of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
They said they hope the report,
released Tuesday night, "will serve as an
authoritative handbook on the ABCs of
ABM." It will be published in book
form by Harper and Row. Chayes,
former State Department legal adviser,
and Wiesner, science adviser to President
John F. Kennedy, organized the project.
It marks the first time in recent years
that a full-scale non Pentagon study of a
major weapons system has been
published during congressional
consideration of the plan. Both the
House and Senate Armed Services
Committee are now considering the
Safeguard proposal, and the outcome in
the Senate is in doubt.
Kennedy suggested the report in
February, before the Safeguard
go-ahead was announced by President
Nixon. The announced purpose was to
give the public and Congress the benefit
of hearing the nonmilitary side of the
argument.
Besides the conclusions developed by
the four professors, the study includes
articles on various aspects of the ABM
by former U.N. Ambassador Arthur J.
Goldberg, former White House press
secretary Bill D. Moyers, former
presidential aide Theodore C. Sorensen
and Profs. Hens A. Bethe and Adam
Yarmolinsky, among others.

WASHINGTON | AP j-President
Nixon, terming hunger in America
"embarrassing and intolerable,"
proposed Tuesday major revision of
food aid programs so that, in another 13
months, they would be costing $2.5
billion a year.
Sending Congress a special message
with little advance notice, Nixon asked
for new laws that would provide all
poor families with additional food
stamps at no cost to themselves if they
fell into the very lowest income
brackets.
Under the Nixon plan, no recipients
of food stamps would pay more than 30
per cent of their income for them.
Officials estimated some now spend
over half their income on food.
Additionally, Nixon said, the
government will extend the food stamp
program to 140 counties not now
sharing in it. He said these counties
would be covered before July 1070,
and administration sources estimate that
these sections of the country without

family food assistance account for 14
per cent of the nation's poor.
Farm Worker Law
WASHINGTON (AP)~The Nixon
administration proposed yesterday a
special collective bargaining law for
farm workers and the idea got support
on Capitol Hill.
Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz
recommended that a farm labor
relations board of three members be
appointed by the President to conduct
bargaining agent elections on large farms
and to handle cases involving unfair
labor practices.
Under the proposal, growers would
be protected against "surprise strikes."
And they would have the option of
setting a 30-day no-strike period for
mediation and binding
recommendations by a neutral panel.
Shultz presented his proposal to a
senate labor subcommittee headed by
Sen. Harrison A. Williams, Jr., D-N.J.
The secretary said it is a product of
discussion with the secretary of
agriculture and others within the Nixon
administration.

He said through his attorney he is

Navy handling of the Pueblo inquiry,
relieved that it's all over, and expects his

despite a Navy board's recommendation
he be court-martialed.
He said through his attorney he is

WASHINGTON [AP]—A report by
two prominent scientists and a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
calls the Safeguard antiballistic missile
ABM system "insurance against war."
It says"it may well be, in fact, the
single most important step the United
States can take toward a real and lasting
peace at this moment in history."
"Antimissile defense is an essential
component in the network of military
systems designed to give the American
people a seamless garment of security in
an age of acute danger," the report says.
The 64-page study, prepared for the
American Security Council, was released
last night.
It was written by Dr. Willard F.
Libby, former Atomic Energy
Commission member and Nobel
Prize-winning chemist; Dr. William J.
Thaler of Georgetown University's
physics department; and retired Gen.
Nathan F. Twining, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Much of the study was devoted to a
comparison of Soviet and U.S. military
efforts and strength. It cited growing
Soviet power and concluded, "The
changed military balance will weaken
Iree world alliance systems and increase
Soviet aggressiveness."
There was little detailed analysis of
the ABM and its components.

WASHINGTON [AP| A 344-page
study commissioned by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy on the Safeguard antiballistic
missile ABM concludes that the system
proposed by the Nixon administration
"cannot perform effectively the
missions suggested for it."
"Our principal conclusion is that
there is no need for a decision to deploy
the Sentinel-Safeguard ABM system at
this time," said the four main authors.
Profs. Abram Chayes of Harvard Law
School and Jerome Wiesner, George
Rathjens and Steven Weinberg of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
They said they hope the report,
released Tuesday night, "will serve as an
authoritative handbook on the ABCs of
ABM." It will be published in book
form by Harper and Row. Chayes,
former State Department legal adviser,
and Wiesner, science adviser to President
John F. Kennedy, organized the project.
It marks the first time in recent years
that a full-scale non Pentagon study of a
major weapons system has been
published during congressional
consideration of the plan. Both the
House and Senate Armed Services
Committee are now considering the
Safeguard proposal, and the outcome in
the Senate is in doubt.
Kennedy suggested the report in
February, before the Safeguard
go-ahead was announced by President
Nixon. The announced purpose was to
give the public and Congress the benefit
of hearing the nonmilitary side of the
argument.
Besides the conclusions developed by
the four professors, the study includes
articles on various aspects of the ABM
by former U.N. Ambassador Arthur J.
Goldberg, former White House press
secretary Bill D. Moyers, former
presidential aide Theodore C. Sorensen
and Profs. Hens A. Bethe and Adam
Yarmolinsky, among others.

WASHINGTON | AP j-President
Nixon, terming hunger in America
"embarrassing and intolerable,"
proposed Tuesday major revision of
food aid programs so that, in another 13
months, they would be costing $2.5
billion a year.
Sending Congress a special message
with little advance notice, Nixon asked
for new laws that would provide all
poor families with additional food
stamps at no cost to themselves if they
fell into the very lowest income
brackets.
Under the Nixon plan, no recipients
of food stamps would pay more than 30
per cent of their income for them.
Officials estimated some now spend
over half their income on food.
Additionally, Nixon said, the
government will extend the food stamp
program to 140 counties not now
sharing in it. He said these counties
would be covered before July 1070,
and administration sources estimate that
these sections of the country without

family food assistance account for 14
per cent of the nation's poor.

with little advance notice, Nixon asked
for new laws that would provide all
poor families with additional food
stamps at no cost to themselves if they
fell into the very lowest income
brackets.
Under the Nixon plan, no recipients
of food stamps would pay more than 30
per cent of their income for them.
Officials estimated some now spend
over half their income on food.
Additionally, Nixon said, the
government will extend the food stamp
program to 140 counties not now
sharing in it. He said these counties
would be covered before July 1070,
and administration sources estimate that
these sections of the country without

family food assistance account for 14
per cent of the nation's poor.
Farm Worker Law
WASHINGTON (AP)~The Nixon
administration proposed yesterday a
special collective bargaining law for
farm workers and the idea got support
on Capitol Hill.
Secretary of Labor George P. Shultz
recommended that a farm labor
relations board of three members be
appointed by the President to conduct
bargaining agent elections on large farms
and to handle cases involving unfair
labor practices.
Under the proposal, growers would
be protected against "surprise strikes."
And they would have the option of
setting a 30-day no-strike period for
mediation and binding
recommendations by a neutral panel.
Shultz presented his proposal to a
senate labor subcommittee headed by
Sen. Harrison A. Williams, Jr., D-N.J.
The secretary said it is a product of
discussion with the secretary of
agriculture and others within the Nixon
administration.

CORONADA (AP)—Cmdr. Lloyd M.
Bucher said today he's satisfied with
Navy handling of the Pueblo inquiry,
relieved that it's all over, and expects his
future will depend on how he handles
his next Navy job.
The man in command when North
Koreans captured the intelligence ship
and some of its secret documents
without resistance was commenting on
word he will be spared punishment,
despite a Navy board's recommendation
he be court-martialed.
He said through his attorney he is
"very relieved that the proceedings are
complete and the matter is final." His
only plans while awaiting reassignment
are to enter a hospital for dental work,
probably next week.
Ho said he will speak out no more on
the Pueblo.
WASHINGTON [AP]—A report by
two prominent scientists and a former
chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
calls the Safeguard antiballistic missile
ABM system "insurance against war."
It says"it may well be, in fact, the
single most important step the United
States can take toward a real and lasting
peace at this moment in history."
"Antimissile defense is an essential
component in the network of military
systems designed to give the American
people a seamless garment of security in
an age of acute danger," the report says.
The 64-page study, prepared for the
American Security Council, was released
last night.
It was written by Dr. Willard F.
Libby, former Atomic Energy
Commission member and Nobel
Prize-winning chemist; Dr. William J.
Thaler of Georgetown University's
physics department; and retired Gen.
Nathan F. Twining, former chairman of
the Joint Chiefs of Staff.
Much of the study was devoted to a
comparison of Soviet and U.S. military
efforts and strength. It cited growing
Soviet power and concluded, "The
changed military balance will weaken
Iree world alliance systems and increase
Soviet aggressiveness."
There was little detailed analysis of
the ABM and its components.

WASHINGTON [AP| A 344-page
study commissioned by Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy on the Safeguard antiballistic
missile ABM concludes that the system
proposed by the Nixon administration
"cannot perform effectively the
missions suggested for it."
"Our principal conclusion is that
there is no need for a decision to deploy
the Sentinel-Safeguard ABM system at
this time," said the four main authors.
Profs. Abram Chayes of Harvard Law
School and Jerome Wiesner, George
Rathjens and Steven Weinberg of
Massachusetts Institute of Technology.
They said they hope the report,
released Tuesday night, "will serve as an
authoritative handbook on the ABCs of
ABM." It will be published in book
form by Harper and Row. Chayes,
former State Department legal adviser,
and Wiesner, science adviser to President
John F. Kennedy, organized the project.
It marks the first time in recent years
that a full-scale non Pentagon study of a
major weapons system has been
published during congressional
consideration of the plan. Both the
House and Senate Armed Services
Committee are now considering the
Safeguard proposal, and the outcome in
the Senate is in doubt.
Kennedy suggested the report in
February, before the Safeguard
go-ahead was announced by President
Nixon. The announced purpose was to
give the public and Congress the benefit
of hearing the nonmilitary side of the
argument.
Besides the conclusions developed by
the four professors, the study includes
articles on various aspects of the ABM
by former U.N. Ambassador Arthur J.
Goldberg, former White House press
secretary Bill D. Moyers, former
presidential aide Theodore C. Sorensen
and Profs. Hens A. Bethe and Adam
Yarmolinsky, among others.
