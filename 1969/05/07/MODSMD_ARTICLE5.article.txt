# Notices Mailed To Another 26
## 
### 
Twenty-six additional students have
been mailed notices of immediate
temporary suspension as a result of their
participation in the May 1 occupation
of Encina Hall.
These suspensions increase to 60 the
number of students barred from
attending classes pending a hearing
before the Stanford Judicial Council.
The announcement of the added
suspensions was made by Dean of
Students Joel Smith. Smith did not
disclose the names of any of those
involved.
It is expected that these students will
be served with the temporary restraining
order issued by the Santa Clara County
Superior Court last Thursday.
Suspended Students Barred
The order bars suspended students
from entering "any classroom,
laboratory, library or other academic
building or any administrative office
building," except to attend meetings of
the Judicial Council.
One of those originally suspended,
Law School student Ronald Barliant,
was cleared at the first hearing held by
the Judicial Council, He had entered the
building only briefly to arrange legal aid
for the occupants of the building.
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman of
the Judicial Council, said that four more
students have requested hearings. The
closed sessions have been scheduled for

Wednesday night (see related story).
The Stanford News Service,
meanwhile, has reported the
disappearance of all of its files on the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI).
Robert Beyers, director fo the News
Service, said the missing SRI files were
maintained as "open files" available to
anyone. He reported that members of
the April 3rd Movement had been in the
news service office to look at the files.
Also apparently taken during the
sit-in were files containing University
budget and salary information.
Stanford officials have estimated
damage during the sit-in at a minimum
of $2,500.
Broken windows and damage to the
four-story building itself will probably
cost at least $1,000 by the time repairs
are completed.
Two $400 electric typewriters were
among the stolen articles, and four were
damagedâ€”some by soft drinks poured
into them. Other stolen property
included petty cash, stamps, a framed
CPA certificate, and a tape recorder.
A set of master keys to the building
also was stolen, and all the locks had to
bo changed. Heavy, case-hardened steel
padlocks on firi> doors between wings of
the building were also cut, presumably
by a heavy bolt-cutter missing from one
of the construction projects on the
campus.


THE FAST CONTINUES as Sophomore Terry litzgerald sils outside President Pitzer's office.
Fitzgerald, who has been joined by several others in his fast until the May 13 Trustees'
meeting, also met yesterday with his April 3 Movement affinity group in the sunshine of the
Inner Quad. Fitzgerald termed his action "a dramatic gesture" so that "people will be aware
of what we're asking."
