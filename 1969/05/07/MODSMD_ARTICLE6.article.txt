# Phenomenon Grows
## Encounter Groups Boom On Farm 
### SUSAN SWARD 
The encounter group phenomenon at
Stanford has been expanding rapidly
over the past two years.
Today the interested Stanford
student may participate in a wide
variety of groups offered by several
different organizations on and off
campus. The group's orientations range
from drug usage to marital problems.
Faculty reaction to the groups may
be characterized as ecstatically positive al
best and critical at worst. Student
reactions range from comments like "It

was a very meaningful experience for
me" to "It's better than watching T.V. I
guess."
The impetus for the groups' growth
seems to have come from several
sources. Some of these sources are
readily isolated, and some are not so
readily defined.
About two years ago the Counseling
and Testing Center, a service operating
within the confines of the Dean's
Office, set up its first encounter groups.
The groups consisted of approximately
eight individuals that met with the goal
of improving their communication and
relations with other people.
Many Predecessors
The Director of the Center, John
Black, says that the development of
encounter groups at Stanford grows out
of an old pattern within psychology.
Psychodrama, t-groups run to train
business executives, and psychotherapy
are included on Black's list of factors
preceding the rapid evolution of the
encounter group scene on campuses
across the country.
This last winter quarter the Center's
encounter groups had evolved to the
point where they included 100 students
in eight groups. The Center attempts to
place a leader with each group. This
leader should have had "some training
in what he's doing, though this doesn't
have to mean a Ph.D.," Black noted.
The Director of the Center feels that
"the anxiety over the possibility of
encounter groups damaging psyches is
unwarrented for the most part. At least
in the case of the supervised group,
there exists very little danger to
anyone."

Black credits Helen Schrader, an
assistant professor of speech and drama,
with having worked with encounter
groups on campus for several years
before the current rage sprang up.
A w areness Is Vital
This quarter Miss Schrader has
approximately 50 students in a number
of encounter groups that she gives for
academic credit. She is a firm advocate
of the role an encounter group can play
within an individual's life. She also
defends the fact that her encounter
groups are given for credit by saying
that awareness is a vital part of learning.
The encounter groups, according to Miss
Schrader, functions to increase the
individual's awareness.
"Awareness is a dimension of being
human," she said. "And learning is
often blocked by the very lack of
communication between human beings.
I feel that more awareness is needed for
the new thought and discovery."
Schrader sees several forces behind
the current interest in encounter groups.
Students who come to Stanford are
primarily from college-bound families.
They have gone to school and absorbed
the information fed them. When they
come to Stanford they are given an
opportunity "to be human," and they
sometimes respond to this opportunity
by joining an encounter group, Schrader
maintains.
Free Exploration
Underneath the discontent on college
campuses today, Schrader feels there is
a big fear in many student's minds
about the state of the nation and the

world. "Students are deeply concerned
about value questions. They want to
explore these questions in a meaningful
way without censorship. They want to
move toward a more personal, direct
type of social intercourse," she said.
The Cowell Health Center is another
organization on campus that has played
a part in running encounter groups. The
Health Center does some group therapy
work using the techniques of the small
group approach. The type of group
ranges from those that focus on
emotional problems to those that are
goa I-orien ted discussions handling
questions like drug usage.
One of the Health Center groups is
led by two Stanford Medical Center
residents and is composed of "young
marrieds." This group deals with the
problems presented by adaption to early
marriage.
Encounter Craze
One psychiatrist at the Health
Center, who preferred to remain
unidentified, said that he was
"somewhat concerned" over the current
cra/.e developing about encounter group
participation.
"In my estimation," the doctor said,
"many people are striving to condense a
part of self-knowledge into a small time.
There are also many people who aren't
qualified to lead such groups: we have
seen some casualities who have had
some emotional upset from a group
experience."
The doctor concluded that, "Like
most movements, the encounter group
scene has a characteristic effect: this
year it's the thing."
