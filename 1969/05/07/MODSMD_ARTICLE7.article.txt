The meeting is sponsored by the
Stanford chapter of the American
Association of University Professors of
which Dornbusch is president.
Dornbusch also announced that SRI
President Charles A. Anderson has
agreed in principle to provide up to
$5,000 to finance a series of workshops
and seminars jointly sponsored by SRI
personnel and Stanford University
faculty and students beginning this fall.
"Matching funds of up to $5,000 will
be solicited from Stanford students and
faculty" explained Dornbusch. "With
this total of $10,000 we should be able
to organize meaningful workshops to
attack such problems as environmental
deterioration.
The initiative for such a series arose
during discussions among an informal
group of 10 students and -1 faculty
members. Included in the group were
Pat Shea and his Council of Presidents
and former ASSU President Denis
Hayes.

"We were simply seeking
constructive ways to improve
relationships between the University
and SRI" Dornbusch explained. Ehrlich
originated the notion of a series of
seminars, focusing on several major
social problems and involving SRI and
Stanford personnel.
The seminar series would begin in the
fall. Planning sessions would begin as
soon as possible and continue through
the summer months. The seminars and
workshops would be held at Stanford
and at SRI.
