Stanford is in desperate need ol some
comic relief. Since no one appears willing
to oblige, we turned to the natural
source The Stanford Daily. Not being
humble enough to expose our own
mistakes and failures for public scrutiny,
we turned to years past, stopping in 1926,
Volume 70 of The Daily.
To our great astonishment, we
discovered that erisis on campus was
startlingly similar to the issues this spring. In
fact, we are now firmly persuaded that
history moves in cycles. Glancing through
past editorials, we were shocked to see the
headline "ENCINA VS JAIL 1 ' on page two
of the October 1 1, 1926 issue.
That editorial, with all its prophetic
grandeur, is printed below:
"The freshmen's latest pleasure consists
of bombarding the Palo Alto street cars as
they pass hncina Hall. One day last
week-end, a peach pit was thrown with
such good aim that it broke a window in
the car and shattered glass on one of the
passengers. Wanton destruction of property
is bad enough pastime for first year men,
but when they start endangering the very
lives of men and women, the deed ceases to
be anything less than a crime.
"Most of the freshmen's pranks have
been passed over with the comment that
boys will be boys, but some things cannot
be tolerated even at college 'where we pay
less for our crimes,' than we will when we
get out in the world. The young man that
threw the missile would not have thought
of throwing a pit at a passing trolley car
from a hotel window in the city. Then why
should he lose his idea of right and wrong

when he is living in Eneina Hall? Such acts
as these may explain why the name
'collegiate' is so grating on the ears of an
outsider.
"It may be of interest to the freshmen
to know that if the act is repeated, the Palo
Alto officials will take the matter in their
own hands, and the jail in the
above-mentioned city is far less homelike
that Hncina I lall."
Student unrest isn't new. Just the
tactics.
