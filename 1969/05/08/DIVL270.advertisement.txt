Want to lash on to some pretty big Eye-deas? Dash over to
our cosmetic counter—and let our cosmetician show you how to
make your eyes come alive with this dramatic new dimension in
eye cosmetics.
Whether you want to bring out the "true you" or discover a
"new you," we'll help you choose your perfect lash-mate from
our eye-enhancing collection of ANDREA real European hair
lashes. And bring out new facets of your personality through a
variety of looks—subtle, daring, demure, glamorous.
Custom-fitted by our skilled cosmetician, these lush lashes
make-over your eyes with a fuller, more commanding beauty all
their own. So natural and comfortable, they become a part of
you—even at closest view. Easy to put on, too—as you'll learn
through a new method that's guaranteed to make you an eye
lash expert, quick as 1-2-3.
If you have eyes for the very best—lend them to us . . . we'll do
the rest. $4.00 to $12,50.
