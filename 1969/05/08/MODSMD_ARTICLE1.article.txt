# SRI Poll Sounds Staff, Alum Views
## 
### 
Comparatively few senior University
staff members and alumni leaders share
Stanford student and faculty concerns
for restraining certain kinds of research
at Stanford Research Institute, a new
opinion sampling suggests.
Conducted by a student-faculty
committee headed by Prof. Nathan
Maccoby, communication, the survey
brought responses from 82 of 260
senior staff members (32 per cent) and
83 of 222 alumni leaders (37 per cent) a
significantly lower response rate than
for previously published polls of
students (44 per cent) and faculty (55
per cent).
Among students and faculty,
substantial majorities of those with
opinions favored a variety of research
restrictions at SRI. Almost half of the
staff members said they favored
restricting chemical, biological, and
radiological warfare research if SRI were
retained by the Univerity, but less than
one fourth of the alumni leaders shared
this view.
Opposition to counter-insurgency
studies, research related to war in
Southeast Asia, and classified work also
was much less widespread among these
two groups than among students and
faculty.
Relationships Favored
When asked what relationship they
favored between the University and
SRI, staff members and alumni leaders
most often mentioned selling SRI for
maximum financial gain or keeping its
present relationship to the University
unchanged. Neither of these actions
would impose external restraints on
SRl's research activities.
More than one third of the staff
(35.4 per cent) and alumni (39.8 per
cent) favored sale of SRI for maximum
gain, without research restraints, a
position taken by one fourth of the
faculty (27.7 per cent) but only a small
proportion of students (7.8 per cent).
Continuing SRl's present relationship
to the University unchanged was the
most popular choice among alumni
(42.2 per cent) and was backed by one

fourth of the staff respondents (29.3
per cent). Unanimously opposed by a
recent student-faculty study committee,
this position was held by one out of
eight students (12.3 per cent) and less
than one in 10 faculty (9.1 per cent).
One fourth of the staff (24.4 per
cent) and one in 16 alumni (6.0 per
cent) favor bringing SRI under closer
control, with a community committee
redirecting its research activities. This
position was backed last week by
one-third of the faculty (35.6 per cent)
and two-thirds of the students (68.2 per
cent) responding to a questionanire.
When asked to rank the most
important issues concerning
University-SRI relations, staff members,
like students and faculty, most often
mentioned increasing socially
constructive research at SRI. Among
alumni, separation of SRI from the
University was the most important
issue, followed by minimizing controls
on SRl's research and maximizing the
University's financial return.
Less than half the senior staff and
less than one-fourth of the alumni
leaders favored imposing research
restraints on SRI, even if it was retained
by the University. This view contrasted
sharply with students and faculty.
