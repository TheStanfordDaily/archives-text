## Issues Debated In A Vacuum 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
A great many people have been
reacting to the moral issues and
concerns of the April 3rd
Movement and discoursing on
them at length. The whoie issue of
morality and people setting
themse'ves up as moral judges is
debated at length but often in a
vacuum. Are not the great
religions of the world at least in
part concerned with issues of
morality and making judgments
about the actions of men? Do not
laws which punish murder have at
least a partial grounding in a
moral belief that killing is wrong,
as well as socially dysfunctional?
Is not the substance of the moral
concerns of the April 3rd
Movement in regard to research a
product of our Judeo-Christian
heritage?
Furthermore, the Research
Guidelines Committee of the
April 3rd Movement showed great
willingness to be flexible in
formulating guidelines which
would allow consideration of each
research proposal on its own
merits. Is not a community review
committee for research more
realistic and less absolutist than
any provision written into a
restrictive covenant? And more
compatible with a humane
academic freedom than the kind
of academic license which many
parade under the term "academic
freedom"?
It would be more than
unfortunate if the emotional
charges or actions of either the
April 3rd Movement or its critics
are allowed to obscure the real
issues at Stanford today: should
Stanford or SRI permit research
which results in the death or
oppression of human beings?
Should Stanford or SRI serve the
interests of other institutions qua
institution? should the Trustees
alone have the legitimate power to
make decisions which affect in
fundamental ways (i.e., life or
death) the lives of other human
beings, either on campus, or in
Oakland, or in Peru, or in
Southeast Asia?
Finally, it strikes me as
somewhat inconsistent that at the

same time President Pitzer is
declaring a state of emergency on
campus that the Trustees insist on
maintaining a "business-as-usual"
attitude which allows them to
defer resolution of the issues on
campus. If they really gave a
damn about what goes on here,
they would be prepared to make a
few personal sacrifices (for a
change), come to the campus,
hold extended open hearings, and
most importantly make a
decision. It is their inaction which
increases frustration and tension
on the cmapus and increases the
likelihood of disruptions which so
many deplore."

Editor, THE DAILY:
There will be no more of this
nonsense spreading around here
especially when all is no longer
necessary for the operation of any
such supernatural causes ground
in the one base fear projected
through whatever image conjures
up the desired ring of circular
reasonings and perambulatory
logic according to the everlasting
piecemeal attempts at bad
thinking generally. Is there anyone
willing to go ahead on what we
think otherwise would be a sad
day for all connected with a
project so wide in possibilities
that there is hardly anyone left to
reach the same conclusion after
hard nights of impatient
tremblings? There is some doubt
remaining about the remarks
broadcast for over the last sixteen
and a half days or the one-sided
opinion we hoped would
eventually succumb to a year's
torture riding over some of the
richest farmland east of heaven
and hell above will be the only
ones with a dismal appearance and
the sanity of garbage mentality
brought to bear on most ol the
sides represented with far-fetched
loyalty.

• Aftermath
Editor, THE DAILY:
A little-known fact concerning
the immediate aftermath of the
AEL sit-in has recently come to
the writer's attention. As most
demonstrators were peacefully
departing from the front door, a
truck drove to the rear of the
building and for one and one-half
hours others methodically
stripped the publications office of
printing materials. Jerold A.
Koerner of AEL Publications
witnessed 4000 pieces of cover
stock being removed in a 10

minute period. The Campus Photo
Service has pictures of the event
and a movie exists showing the
driver and truck pulling away.
I do not ask that charges be
brought against the perpetrators
of this crime, as it should not be
necessary to do so, but I do ask
that the University community
carefully consider the ever
increasing strain on the credibility
of the radical element of the April
3rd Movement.

A great many people have been
reacting to the moral issues and
concerns of the April 3rd
Movement and discoursing on
them at length. The whoie issue of
morality and people setting
themse'ves up as moral judges is
debated at length but often in a
vacuum. Are not the great
religions of the world at least in
part concerned with issues of
morality and making judgments
about the actions of men? Do not
laws which punish murder have at
least a partial grounding in a
moral belief that killing is wrong,
as well as socially dysfunctional?
Is not the substance of the moral
concerns of the April 3rd
Movement in regard to research a
product of our Judeo-Christian
heritage?
Furthermore, the Research
Guidelines Committee of the
April 3rd Movement showed great
willingness to be flexible in
formulating guidelines which
would allow consideration of each
research proposal on its own
merits. Is not a community review
committee for research more
realistic and less absolutist than
any provision written into a
restrictive covenant? And more
compatible with a humane
academic freedom than the kind
of academic license which many
parade under the term "academic
freedom"?
It would be more than
unfortunate if the emotional
charges or actions of either the
April 3rd Movement or its critics
are allowed to obscure the real
issues at Stanford today: should
Stanford or SRI permit research
which results in the death or
oppression of human beings?
Should Stanford or SRI serve the
interests of other institutions qua
institution? should the Trustees
alone have the legitimate power to
make decisions which affect in
fundamental ways (i.e., life or
death) the lives of other human
beings, either on campus, or in
Oakland, or in Peru, or in
Southeast Asia?
Finally, it strikes me as
somewhat inconsistent that at the

same time President Pitzer is
declaring a state of emergency on
campus that the Trustees insist on
maintaining a "business-as-usual"
attitude which allows them to
defer resolution of the issues on
campus. If they really gave a
damn about what goes on here,
they would be prepared to make a
few personal sacrifices (for a
change), come to the campus,
hold extended open hearings, and
most importantly make a
decision. It is their inaction which
increases frustration and tension
on the cmapus and increases the
likelihood of disruptions which so
many deplore."

willing to go ahead on what we

• Aftermath
Editor, THE DAILY:
A little-known fact concerning
the immediate aftermath of the
AEL sit-in has recently come to
the writer's attention. As most
demonstrators were peacefully
departing from the front door, a
truck drove to the rear of the
building and for one and one-half
hours others methodically
stripped the publications office of
printing materials. Jerold A.
Koerner of AEL Publications
witnessed 4000 pieces of cover
stock being removed in a 10

minute period. The Campus Photo
Service has pictures of the event
and a movie exists showing the
driver and truck pulling away.
I do not ask that charges be
brought against the perpetrators
of this crime, as it should not be
necessary to do so, but I do ask
that the University community
carefully consider the ever
increasing strain on the credibility
of the radical element of the April
3rd Movement.
