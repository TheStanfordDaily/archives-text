## Foreign Student's Role 
### Victor R. Palomino 
For days now I have been politically cut down by my best Latin
American friends. Why? It is all because of some signatures I was asking
from them a few days ago to support the then April Third Coalition.
Some have called me a troublemaker who does not miss any
opportunity to raise hell and others a chicken who runs away when the
action begins. I think there must be some misunderstanding. Therefore,
today I would like to express some of my feelings concerning the
Movement are the role of a visiting student at Stanford.
It is true that people are dying in Vietnam; it is true that people are
being brutalized in my land, but it is also true that the majority of
Americans do not know or do not understand the errors of their
capitalistic system; the heart, the core, of the issues being raised today,
and therefore, they do not want to join a movement which they blindly
condemn.
So long as the majority of Americans keep on believing that their
system is the best one and applicable everywhere else; that they in no
way influence the destiny of other nations; that they are the good guys
and the Communists the bad guys; then, there will be little hope for
peaceful changes in other parts of the world.
It is therefore quite important that the April Third Movement
actively engage in a process of mass education, and avoid for as long as
possible a directconfrontation with the guardians of "law and order.

Teach the silent majority the good ond the bad of this nation. I suppose
we all have many things to learn, many things to see, many things to
feel. To live materially well in a world of half truths is not to live. To
live is to struggle through life knowing or striving to know whole truths
however haru they might be.
Suffering, misery, hunger, and death are all part of life, of our
existence; we cannot ever hope to completely vanish then from this
world, but we can try; we can always try to make things better. And
trying takes courage.
I personally believe that the struggle you are carrying on now is
almost one hundred percent yours. Just like the North Vietnamese have
not asked any Americans for direct help to fight your fellow
countrymen, in the same w ay I feel that the most I could do for you is
to strongly support all your demands, but the means and the fighting to
accomplish them must in the end be a decision and an action taken
only by Americans, for if I believe that in Peru and other parts of the
world people are today ready to take over the direction of their
destinies; then, it is only fair to add that Americans are also quite
capable to change theirs.
And the day whenever I decide to pick up a rifle and shoot to kill
will be when I am in my Peruvian mountains, not here.

Some have called me a troublemaker who does not miss any
opportunity to raise hell and others a chicken who runs away when the
action begins. I think there must be some misunderstanding. Therefore,
today I would like to express some of my feelings concerning the
Movement are the role of a visiting student at Stanford.
It is true that people are dying in Vietnam; it is true that people are
being brutalized in my land, but it is also true that the majority of
Americans do not know or do not understand the errors of their
capitalistic system; the heart, the core, of the issues being raised today,
and therefore, they do not want to join a movement which they blindly
condemn.
So long as the majority of Americans keep on believing that their
system is the best one and applicable everywhere else; that they in no
way influence the destiny of other nations; that they are the good guys
and the Communists the bad guys; then, there will be little hope for
peaceful changes in other parts of the world.
It is therefore quite important that the April Third Movement
actively engage in a process of mass education, and avoid for as long as
possible a directconfrontation with the guardians of "law and order.

Teach the silent majority the good ond the bad of this nation. I suppose
we all have many things to learn, many things to see, many things to
feel. To live materially well in a world of half truths is not to live. To
live is to struggle through life knowing or striving to know whole truths
however haru they might be.
Suffering, misery, hunger, and death are all part of life, of our
existence; we cannot ever hope to completely vanish then from this
world, but we can try; we can always try to make things better. And
trying takes courage.
I personally believe that the struggle you are carrying on now is
almost one hundred percent yours. Just like the North Vietnamese have
not asked any Americans for direct help to fight your fellow
countrymen, in the same w ay I feel that the most I could do for you is
to strongly support all your demands, but the means and the fighting to
accomplish them must in the end be a decision and an action taken
only by Americans, for if I believe that in Peru and other parts of the
world people are today ready to take over the direction of their
destinies; then, it is only fair to add that Americans are also quite
capable to change theirs.
And the day whenever I decide to pick up a rifle and shoot to kill
will be when I am in my Peruvian mountains, not here.

For days now I have been politically cut down by my best Latin
American friends. Why? It is all because of some signatures I was asking
from them a few days ago to support the then April Third Coalition.
