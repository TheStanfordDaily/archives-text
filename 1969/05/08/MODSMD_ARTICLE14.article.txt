## A3M And Academic Freedom 
### William E. Spicer 
The keystone for academic
freedom is respect for the
integrity and ability of the
individual faculty member.
Without such respect, academic
freedom has no meaning. The
April Third Coalition and their
allies would destroy academic
freedom either through design or
through ignorance.
"A Review Board must be
created which is empowered to
terminate existing contracts and
grants and to veto the acceptance
of new contracts or proposals
which violate community
guidelines . . .These guidelines are
intended to orient research
priorities toward meeting pressing
needs of the world's
population . . .The results of basic
and applied research can and
should benefit all peoples." Thus
reads the "Guidelines for
Research at Stanford and SRI" as
adopted by the April Third
Coalition.
How long and hard has Western
Society fought to rise above such
statement whether they came
from Church, State, or, as in this
case, a dedicated minority? In the
middle ages the Catholic Church
knew it was correct and so must
impose its will on the individual
thinker. It was not good for the
community to think that the
earth was not the center of the
universe; therefore, some must die
at the stake and Galileo must
recant or suffer a similar fate.

Would the benefit of Newton's
thoughts have been apparent to
the community of Cambridge in
the 17th century? Fulton and his
steamboat were considered a
"Folly" by the populus in the
19th century New York.
Genius is a very delicate and
individual thing. Individual genius
has flourished in the Western
World for the last four centuries
and produced fantastic
developments. This has been
possible only because of the idea
of individual responsibility and
integrity which has developed and
been closely embodied in the ideal
of academic freedom, The rest of
the world did not fully develop
this ideal, neither has it developed
strong science and technology.
What is has of both had been
transplanted principally from the
West.
But all is not brightness and
light. Science and technology has
not only increased our health and
material well-being, it has
developed terrifying potentials for
war and death. It is for this reason
that academic freedom is now
being challenged and we are being
asked to return to the outlook of
the early middle ages when the
community in the form of the
church, or a political group such
as the Aprii Third Coalition, tells
the individual research worker
what he can and cannot do and
what he can and cannot
investigate. It is the community
and not the individual which
decides the work which is best.
But how can the scientist who is
exploring the unknown tell what
his thoughts will develop? And so,
how can he convince the
community that what he does is
for their benefit. This is what
academic freedom is all about.
If the community passes
judgment on each individual
scientific research project, will it
be willing to stop there? Should it
not examine the thoughts and
teaching of the historian or

philosopher to see if they are
aiding the world? This is the
pattern in the Soviet Union,
China, and Cuba where the
principle of community control of
the individual is institutionalized.
Is that desired here?
