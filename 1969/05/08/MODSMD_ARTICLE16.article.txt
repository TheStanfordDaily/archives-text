## Crisis At 'Happiness' 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON-The editors
of Perfect Happiness were sitting
around the editorial room the
other day in despair.
"Our circulation figures are
down, housewives are turning off
on us by the thousands. What are
we going to do?" one of the
editors said.
"Our problem is that we're a
magazine devoted to the home,
and the magazines that are selling
these days are those devoted to
sex. Our readers would never
stand for our discussing sex in a
family magazine."
"Wait a minute," the art
director said. /'They wouldn't
stand for it if we came out for it,
but what if we had an issue
devoted to coming out against
it?"
"Hey," said an executive
editor. "That sounds great. We
could say we feel it's out duty as a
leader of the mass media to show
the American mother what
dangers await her children in a
permissive society."
"Right. We could get offensive
still picturos from 'I am

Curiousâ€”Yellow' and 'The Killing
of Sister George."
"What about a spread on the
Broadway musical 'Hair,' showing
those horrible nude bodies on the
stage?"
"Maybe we could get some
photographs from 'Che,' the
off-off-Broadway show they
closed up after one performance."
"We could do a montage of all
the dirty movie advertisements."
Everyone was excited. "We'll
get research to dig up salacious
passages from 'Portnoy's
Complaint,' 'Couples' and 'Myra
Breckenridge."
The editor seemed pleased. "Of
course, to balance the art work
we'd have to have some articles
from respectable people who are
as shocked about the Sexual
Revolution as we are."
"What about Everett Dirksen,
Dr. Norman Vincent Peale and A 1
Capp?"
"That's a great idea. We ought
to get a few psychiatrists and one
Negro writer, too, just so people
won't

people are concerned about sex."
"Oh, boy," said the photo
editor, clapping his hands
together. "What an issue. I can't
wait to get my camera."
The managing editor said, "I
think if we showed a couple in the
front of the book making love, it
would hit our readers harder and
make them aware of the
frightening things that are going
on in this country."
"I'm ahead of you, Peabody. I
was thinking of using the couple
on the cover."
"The cover," said the art
director gleefully. "Oh, boy, that
will really hit home."
The executive editor said, "All
we're doing is showing the horrors
of the Sexual Revolution. We
don't want our readers to get any
enjoyment out of this issue. Our
slogan is still 'You May Not Like
It, But the American Woman Has
a Right to Know."
