## When Should Police Be Called? 
### John S. Morrissey 
The question, "Under what
conditions should the police be
asked to assist the University" is
rapidly becoming a central one at
Stanford, as well as at other
universities. That some
mechanism of assuring the
physical safety of the student
body, faculty, administration, and
employees, if not to protect their
right to continue their academic
pursuits, will be required seems to
have a high probability.
It would be wise to discuss
these conditions and the
advantages and disadvantages
while it is still possible to do so in
a relatively calm and unemotional
state. That there are certain
conditions under which the policy
would be welcome is fairly
evident; murder, arson, and
organized robbery are a few
examples of these.
The strongest argument for
acceptance of the police on
campus is to consider what might
happen if the University should
decide to forego their assistance
under any circumstances. Any
group which is determined to
exert control over an activity on
the campus will then be free to
pursue any tactic of disruption,
coercion, or intimidation which
their collective conscience

permits. The only restraints on
such a group will be the threat of
counter-disruption from a group
having ideals or principles
opposite to the first group.
Limits of SL)S
As to the limits which groups
of the nature of the SDS or others
will impose upon themselves, the
experiences at Berkeley, San
Francisco State, San Mateo
College, Cornell and Colgate—to
mention a few —indicates that the
sky is the limit. Beatings of
students who refused to accept
the dictates of the self-elected
elite, bombings of the University
and the private homes of
administrators, destruction of
equipment, looting of private as
well as University files, were
commonplace.
If there is nothing to prevent
coercive conduct, then the group
which can manage to arouse the
emotions of its members to a high
pitch and whose members are
capable of the least restraint and
most irrational, destructive acts
are free to assume control over
any function of the University
they choose, whether it is
selection of faculty, admission of
students, or the acceptance of
research.
The concept of a university

which is established along rules
which assure the accendance of its
least rational, most violent
members to its control has to me
something ludicrous in it. There
is, however, the second
possibility—that a group with
opposing views which wishes to
either allow or assure activities
inimical to the first.
Escalation Inevitahlc
To protect its views, the
second group must be prepared to
act equally violently or
irrationally as the first, to counter
every disruption with either a
show of force adequate to deter
the first group, or with a
counter-disruption of equal or
greater magnitude. Escalation is
seemingly inevitable. Experience
indicates that under such
circumstances issues are forgotten.
Getting even, or showing the
other fellow what he is in for,
become paramount.
Neither of these situations
appear attractive to me.
Compared to the possibility of
two armed camps staging
counter -disruptions, the
acceptance of police on campus to
protect the tranquility of the
University and to preserve it as a
place for rational discourse is easy
to accept.

One drawback to the use of
police assistance is the stated
boast of the SDS, "If police are
called, the sky is the limit." This
seems to imply that we are faced
with obedience to their demands
or else implicity assent to their
disruptions. The placards of
"Police Brutality" are possibly
already prepared.
If, however, after thoughtful
discussion of the issues involved,
and the need for a non-vigilante
type of counter force, the
University community decides to
establish limits of protest beyond
which no one may trespass or be
subject to the civil police forces,
the SDS has no claim to privilege
for its members. Any pleas for
solidarity should be treated as
what they would then be —a
request for the help of a
community whose rules they were
not willing to obey from persons
bent on destroying the
community whose assistance they
ask.
It is not unreasonable to
require that persons wishing to
remain under the protection of

the University community have
some respect for the rights of
others in that community to live
their lives free of disruption.
