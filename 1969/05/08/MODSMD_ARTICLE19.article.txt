## Administrators' Use Of Police 
### Bill Evers 
Last week the Santa Clara
County sheriff and his deputies
briefly occupied Encina Hall.
Provost Richard Lyman called the
affair a defeat.
Lyman told the assembled
members of the Academic
Council, "Any time it becomes
necessary for a university to
summon the police, a defeat has
taken place." Earlier that day the
administration had called on civil
power to enforce the
administration's authority on the
campus. Stanford students were
not cooperating with on-campus
judicial procedures. Because
administrators were unsuccessful
in getting students "to help make
the system work," it was
necessary to call in the police.
This was the defeat.
Social control is a major
function of university
administration. The University
structure works effectively as a
social control mechanism as long
as it holds power in its hands and as
long as its authority is recognized
as legitimate. A force which
comes from below is a threat to
those in charge. Because all
governing processes are
institutionalized coercion, direct
action by insurgents is a force
which strikes at the rulers'
monopoly of power.
If any university
administration does not meet the
challenge of a sit-in, it abdicates
its rule. The administrators must
end the sit-in and punish those
sit ting-in. Even if administrators
sympathize with the moral
concerns of the rebels,
administrators cannot sympathize
with the tactics of rebellion.
In last Sunday's New York

Times Magazine, Bob Ross of the
New University Conference
wrote: "The question of whether
police should be called, or
whether a university itself should
take action is, after all, a
discussion of the most expeditious
way to repress radical movements
or bring to an end actions they
take."
If police come on campus,
students are radicalized. That is,
students find that radical analysis
best describes what they have
experienced. The institutional
violence of the American system
is hidden behind many screens. To
expose the masked violence, it
takes the behavior of peace
candidate Lyndon Johnson in
Vietnam, or personal encounters
with Mayor Daley's police or with
the draft system, or the possibility
of George Wallace guiding the ship
of state.
Stanford's administrators have
carefully avoided provoking a
large-scale student rebellion. After
the Encina sit-in, President
Kenneth Pitzer explicitly
described the University's
temporary restraining order as
"not political"; the April 3
Movement found it to be "clear
political suppression."
The radicals' charge of
"political suppression" has a
certain credibility for people at
Stanford. The University is clearly
engaged in counter-insurgency and
war-re I a ted research. If the
University were not already a
political entity, attacks of a
political nature could not be made
on it, and reprisals against those
who attacked the University could
not be called acts of suppression.
The University administrators

obtained the court order not, as
some have maintained, in order to
destroy the April 3 Movement.
They merely wished, as efficient
administrators, to render the
Movement ineffective. To
understand what the
administrators really mean by
''rational dialogue" and
'' dec is i on-making through
recognized channels" is to
understand that they have the
police on their side.
