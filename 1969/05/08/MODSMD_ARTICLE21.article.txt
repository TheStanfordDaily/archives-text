# Panel Discusses Dangers
## Supersonic Transport 
### 
"Supersonic Transports will
never be operated at supersonic
speeds over populated areas,"
Professor Holt Ashley told an
audience of 70 people Tuesday
night at Tresidder Union. The
panel discussion entitled "SST:
Boom or Bust," was sponsored by
the Stanford Population and
Environment Forum.
Ashley is a professor of
Aeronautics and Astronautics at
Stanford and a consultant for
Boeing. Other panel members
included William Baxter, Professor
of Law at Stanford and specialist
in legal problems associated with
the boom, and Kenneth Hansen,
economist and former Assistant
Director of the Bureau of the
Budget.

Ashley vigorously defended the
production of the Supersonic
Transport (SST), the Boeing
designed superjet, explaining that
boomless SST's simply aren't
feasible. He repeated several times
that the SSTs would fly at below
sound barrier speeds when over
populated areas. The SSTs could
be operated economically at the
sub-sonic speed, he added.
Continuous Dooms
Baxter objected to the
continuous booms produced when
the SST flies supersonically. The
SST would cut a swath of shock
waves 35-50 miles wide, he said.
The booms are particularly
disturbing because of the
suddenness, he continued. On
occasion the strength of the shock
may be quadrupled which might
cause a "very serious amount of
damage," Baxter added.
Liability for damages and
massive federal support for the
SST project are also problems
Baxter discussed. He explained his
plan for a "pay back fund" in
which airlines would contribute
on a formula basis to a fund that
would be liable for personal and
property damage resulting from
sonic booms.
Baxter argued that if Boeing
believed the SST so
"economically feasible," the
company need not rely on
taxpayers money.
Federal Funding
Hansen said that the federal
government is presently commited
to the SST program but suggested
that Congress do some "social
accounting" to add up all the
pluses and minuses.
He estimated that $653 million
had already been payed out by
the government and another $50
million pledged by private
industry.
Hansen raised the possibility
that the money required to
"educate" people to accept

booms might be chopped from
the education programs for ghetto
children.


WILLIAM BAXTER-Law Professor
William Baxter spoke Tuesday night on
die problems of Supersonic Transports,
as member of a panel sponsored by die
Population and Environment Forum.
Baxter is also chairman of Stanford's
Research Guidelines Committee.
