# Future YAF Chairman Calls Communism "Too Collectivism"
## 
### 
Ex-Maoist Phillip Abbot Luce
said he left the Progressive Labor
Party in 1965 because he felt
communism was too collectivist
and totalitarian. In June he will
become chairman of the National
College Division of the Young
Americans for Freedom.
Luce, author of The New Left,
Koad lo Revolution: Communist
Guerilla Warfare in the U.S.A.,
and The Intelligent Student's
Guide lo Survival, spoke to about
eighty persons in Tresidder
Tuesday night. His appearance

was sponsored by the Young
Americans for Freedom and the
Political Union.
Luce said he began his leftist
activities in the early sixties as a
graduate student in political
science at Ohio State University.
He joined the Emergency Civil
Liberties Committee in 1962 and
tried, along with Le√üoi Jones, to
take over the magazine
Mainstream. Luce eventually
joined the Progressive Labor Party
and became editor of its
magazine.

In 1963 Luce and 58 other
leftists went to Cuba to meet
Communist leaders, including Che
Guevara and Fidel Castro. He
characterized Castro as a man of
"considerable charisma" who
"felt he could solve all the
problems of Cuba by just arriving
at the scene."
Break With Communism
Luce broke with communism
in 1965 after satisfying himself
that the communist organizations
did not allow internal dissent and
aimed to make the United States
totalitarian.
Now Luce considers the
Communist Party USA "a group
of tottering old men searching for
some semblance of youth."
The New Left, said,
includes people who would have
to be considered "anarchists."
Luce opposes anarchy because he
believes it would cause a vacuum
that would be filled by the
extreme left or the extreme right.
He said that when the radicals
turned to "bully-boy techniques,"
they caused a backlash and
further divided the American
people.
Luce commented that the SDS
has the cohesiveness of a men's
room: "People come in, do their
thing and go out the door."
Liberation Conservative
He now considers himself a
"libertarian conservative." He
believes in a free market, free
speech and free actions by
individuals generally without
government restraint, and less
government in almost all areas.
According to Luce, the draft
represents the worst aspects of
collectivism and must be fought
and repealed. He also opposes the
concept of a lottery, which he
said would be even more
inhumane because it would decide
man's fate by the simple spinning
of a wheel. He favors a voluntary
military.
