# Third Round Choice
## NBA Picks Griffin 
### FRED MANN 
Don Griffin, Stanford's fifth
leading All-time scorer was
drafted by the Atlanta Hawks of
the National Basketball
, ssoc uon late yesterday. He was
the Hawk's third round choice.
Griffin, a 21 year old senior
guard from Oakland, was
previously selected by the
Oakland Oaks of the rival ABA in
their draft last month.
Griffin expressed both joy and
surprise at his selection. "Of
course I'm excited, but I'd sure
like to know why they picked
me," he said.
Griffin had been contacted by
every NBA team except Los
Angeles, Philadelphia,
and Atlanta. "Oakland started
calling wh n they lost two of their
top guards," Griffin continued.
"But I h d no contact at all with
the Hawks. I didn't even know
who theii coach was."
The .soft spoken sponsor in
Madera House added that it was
too early to say which offer he
would .accept. In fact, an Atlanta
offer ha not yet been made. "I
was co! .acted by telegram this
(Wedne.Mi.iy) afternoon," he said.
When asked if he would prefer
to pi:'v ii> the older, established

NBA rather than in Oakland, his
home town, ho quipped, "I
couldn't say. I'm an open minded
chap, you know."
Throughout the Stanford
basketball season, Griffin was a
veritable one-man team. The 6-4,
185 pound "Griff" was the only
real scoring punch the Indians
had, but quite a punch it was. He
finished his finest year with 532
points, just short of the All-time
Stanford single season mark set by
a current NBA starter, Art Harris.
Griffin amassed 1,256 points in
his varsity career. His shooting
however, is not his only talent.
Don was the sparkplug for the
Tribe, and served as co-captain.
His constant hustle and great
playmaking ability were often
overshadowed by his shooting.
Griffin was the team director,
always making the impossible
pass, guarding the enemy's top
scorer, and still grabbing off more
than five rebounds per game.
Early in the year, Griffin was
deadly with his 20 foot jumpers
from every angle. Later on he
began to drive more, challenging
bigger men up the middle, a
quality necessary for the pros.
Although he underwent a
shooting slump near the end of
the long year, Griff broke out of

it when needed, in the final Big
Game against Cal. He hit for 24 in
the finale. He was named to the
All Pacific-8 second team.
Other Pac-8 players grabbed in
the NBA draft yesterday (the first
two rounds were held last month),
were mainly from UCLA. The
Milwaukee Bucks who grabbed
Lew Alcindor also picked up his
Bruin teammate Kenny Heitz in
the fifth round. UCLA's Bill
Sweek went to Phoenix in the
seventh round, the same time that
San Diego chose Lynn
Shackleford.
The San Francisco Warriors
picked Denise Long of Union,
lowa on the 13th round, but NBA
sexual segregation remained intact
as the pick was disallowed by the
NBA front office.

seventh round, the same time that
San Diego chose Lynn
Shackleford.
The San Francisco Warriors
picked Denise Long of Union,
lowa on the 13th round, but NBA
sexual segregation remained intact
as the pick was disallowed by the
NBA front office.
Don Griffin, Stanford's fifth
leading All-time scorer was
drafted by the Atlanta Hawks of
the National Basketball
, ssoc uon late yesterday. He was
the Hawk's third round choice.
Griffin, a 21 year old senior
guard from Oakland, was
previously selected by the
Oakland Oaks of the rival ABA in
their draft last month.
Griffin expressed both joy and
surprise at his selection. "Of
course I'm excited, but I'd sure
like to know why they picked
me," he said.
Griffin had been contacted by
every NBA team except Los
Angeles, Philadelphia,
and Atlanta. "Oakland started
calling wh n they lost two of their
top guards," Griffin continued.
"But I h d no contact at all with
the Hawks. I didn't even know
who theii coach was."
The .soft spoken sponsor in
Madera House added that it was
too early to say which offer he
would .accept. In fact, an Atlanta
offer ha not yet been made. "I
was co! .acted by telegram this
(Wedne.Mi.iy) afternoon," he said.
When asked if he would prefer
to pi:'v ii> the older, established

NBA rather than in Oakland, his
home town, ho quipped, "I
couldn't say. I'm an open minded
chap, you know."
Throughout the Stanford
basketball season, Griffin was a
veritable one-man team. The 6-4,
185 pound "Griff" was the only
real scoring punch the Indians
had, but quite a punch it was. He
finished his finest year with 532
points, just short of the All-time
Stanford single season mark set by
a current NBA starter, Art Harris.
Griffin amassed 1,256 points in
his varsity career. His shooting
however, is not his only talent.
Don was the sparkplug for the
Tribe, and served as co-captain.
His constant hustle and great
playmaking ability were often
overshadowed by his shooting.
Griffin was the team director,
always making the impossible
pass, guarding the enemy's top
scorer, and still grabbing off more
than five rebounds per game.
Early in the year, Griffin was
deadly with his 20 foot jumpers
from every angle. Later on he
began to drive more, challenging
bigger men up the middle, a
quality necessary for the pros.
Although he underwent a
shooting slump near the end of
the long year, Griff broke out of

it when needed, in the final Big
Game against Cal. He hit for 24 in
the finale. He was named to the
All Pacific-8 second team.
Other Pac-8 players grabbed in
the NBA draft yesterday (the first
two rounds were held last month),
were mainly from UCLA. The
Milwaukee Bucks who grabbed
Lew Alcindor also picked up his
Bruin teammate Kenny Heitz in
the fifth round. UCLA's Bill
Sweek went to Phoenix in the
seventh round, the same time that
San Diego chose Lynn
Shackleford.
