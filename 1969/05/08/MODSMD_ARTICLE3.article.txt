# The 						"Thing To Do"?
## Encounter Groups Critiqued

Do statistics on encounter group
participation support the observation
that encounter groups are "the thing to
do" this year?
At the very least, statistics compiled
by the Esalen Institute at Stanford and
the Midpeninsula Free University seem
to demonstrate that there are many

encounter groups in operation this year.
As for the thing-to-do aspect of
encounter group participation, leaders,
participants and crjtics of the groups do
not seem to agree . on how much
conformity motivates people to joi
groups.
The head of the Esalen Institute
program at Stanford, Martine Boote,
makes some estimates which may

indicate that this year encounter groups
are well-attended.
"Over the last year and a half about
2,000 students, faculty and staff from
Stanford have participated in encounter
groups offered by Esalen," said Miss
Boote.
Free University
The Midpeninsula Free University, an
organization funded by the
contributions of its members, is another
area where encounter group activity is
going on. From Miss Boote's knowledge
of the enrollment size of Free U classes,
>he estimates that about 1000 members
:>f the Free U enroll in at least one
jncounter group per quarter.
On still another front within the
University, researchers are attempting to
gauge the effectiveness of the encounter
group approach.
Under the direction of Dr. Morton
Liberman, a visiting associate professor
from the University of Chicago, a team
of doctors is working on the "Group
Experience Project."
The doctors on the project are
evaluating data received from the study
of 250 students in several encounter
groups connected with the racism and
prejudice course being given this spring
as an undergraduate special. The results
of the research of the Liberman team
will probably be known in about three
or four months.
Growth at Stanford
Joseph Katz, executive director of
the Human Problems Institute at
Stanford, feels that the growth of
encounter groups has been so rapid at
Stanford because "the encounter group
fell on a soil that was already so
inclined."
Katz thinks that encounter groups
are particularly popular at Stanford
because of the proximity of Esalen and

because of the availability of leaders in
the area.
Though he denies that he possesses
any crystal-ball foresight, Katz thinks
that within the next two or three years
the emphasis in encounter groups is
going to change. While retaining much
of its present emphasis on individual
well-being, the encounter group is going
to be used more as a tool for social
service.
Student Opinion
Student opinion about the
effectiveness of encounter groups is as
varied as faculty opinion.
One senior history major in a racism
and prejudice group this quarter says,
"I'm not doing this because I think it is
the thing to do. I'm in this group
because I feel I can learn a lot from it."
This particular student rides a bus to
Oakland once a week with his group to
take part in a Synanon-run group. This
group has not dealt with the racism
issue at all and has not focused
extensively on drug usuage either.
Instead it has functioned as a group
therapy unit touching on all aspects of
the members' psychological make-up.
other View
Some students have a
less-than-favorable estimation of
encounter groups.
One junior physics major, a veteran
of two encounter groups that had fairly
experienced leaders, said, "The
encounter group is an example of cheap,
popular psychiatry. It won't die out for
a long time." He went on to express an
opinion that many student participators
of groups express.
The effectiveness of the group,
according to the student, depends on
the quality of the leader heading the
group and on the orientation that the
individual group takes.
