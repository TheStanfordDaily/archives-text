# Pitzer Not To Attend
## ROTC Cancels Presidential Review 
### 
The annual ROTC Presidential
Review, a Stanford tradition of long
standing, was cancelled yesterday after
President Kenneth Pit/.er had told the
ROTC departments he did not wish to
attend.
Pitzer informed the departments he
was reducing attendance at ceremonial
functions.
The Review had been scheduled for
May 27. The Army and Navy ROTC will
continue to hold separate awards
ceremonies on May 20 and 19
respectively, while the Air Force will
present its awards on an individual basis.
Pitzer had "accepted tentatively" the
formal initiation to attend the
Presidential Review, according to his
executive assistant Fred. O. Glover. "In
this particular situation he felt he
should treat ROTC like any other
department," Glover said. Pitzer could
not be reached for comment.
A week ago, the faculty vote pf
403-356 was announced which ended
academic credit for military training,

beginning with the 1970 freshman class.
The vote, taken by mail of all
Academic Council members, reaffirmed
a decision by the Academic Senate
earlier this year.
Traditionally, the President gave
achievement awards at the Review to
the honor cadets in each of the three
services.
Col. Robert L. Thomas, head of
Naval Science, said "The President
didn't feel that with the changes being
brought about n the ROTC program at
Stanford, that he should participate in
the Review as it had been held in the
past."
When Pitzer informed ROTC that he
did not wish to attend, "it was felt that
the whole reason for the end of the year
ceremony would largely be nullified,"
said Thomas.
The phase-out of ROTC credit at
Stanford is part of a nationwide trend
which has included Harvard, Yale and
other schools.
Stanford and other universities are
negotiating with the Defense

Department to set up a new kind of
officer training program which would be
acceptable to both the universities and
the services.
