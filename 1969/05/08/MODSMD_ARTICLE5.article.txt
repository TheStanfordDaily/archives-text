# Files Returned, Others Missing
## 
### 
The News Service files on Stanford
Research Institute were returned early
Wednesday, shortly after their
disappearance was mentioned in The
Daily.
A staff member from another office
borrowed them over the weekend of
April 26-27, promising to return them
April 28.
News Service Director Bob Beyers
said yesterday"I erroneously assumed
this had happened. Shortly after our
staff noticed the files were missing
Tuesday, a Palo Alto Times reporter
called and 1 mentioned this to him
casually. His story later became the
source of your information. It went no
further, so far as I know.
"I regret any embarrassment this
may have caused the April Third
Movement. They have used the files in
the past, and remain free to do so in the
future."
Salary and budget files which were
kept in unlocked files in the Controller's
Office are still missing. They were in
Fncina Hall before the building was
occupied.
The bolt cutter mentioned in
yesterday's Daily as possibly having
been stolen from a construction xite
actually belonged to a member of the
April 3rd Movement, and was brought
into the building by that person. When a
recent Stanford graduate trying to
prevent their use attempted to take the
cutters from their owner, a minor
scuffle ensued.
