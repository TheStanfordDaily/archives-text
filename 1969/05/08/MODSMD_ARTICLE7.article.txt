# Suspensions Rise; Civ Profs Protest
## 
### DENNIS PERLUSS 
Nine more students have been sent
notice of immediate, temporary
suspension as a result of their
participation in the occupation of
Encina Hall.
This brings to 69 the number of
students suspended until they appear
before the Stanford Judicial Council for
hearings on their part in the sit-in.
Four hearings on the Encina incident
have already been held. The Council
heard three of these last night, but the
decisions were not available before press
time.
One of the students originally
suspended, Ronald Barliant, was cleared
at the first hearing held by the Council.
He had entered the building only briefly
to arrange legal aid for the occupants of
the building.
Civ Protest
A strong protest against the Superior
Court temporary restraining order
which bars suspended students from
entering "any classroom, laboratory,
library or other academic building or
any administrative office building," was
issued by 19 of the 23 members of the
Western Civilization Staff.
In a letter to the Daily the
instructors declared that if the order is

enforced against any of their students,
they will refuse to turn in their grade
sheets. This would affect 1300 students,
(see text below)
A number of professors have also
joined in the protest against the
injunction by holding their classes
outdoors, thus allowing suspended
students to attend class without
entering an academic building.
General Meeting Tonight
Members of the April 3rd Movement,
meanwhile, have scheduled a general
meeting for tonight at 9:30 in Cubberly
Auditorium. The session is being called
a decision-making meeting to decide on
activities in preparation for Tuesday's
Trustee meeting.
The 9:30 general meeting will be
preceded at 7:30 by the film "The
Organizer," which is part of the
S DS-Resistance "Up Against the
Screen" film series.
There will also be a meeting of all
those students who have received
notification of suspensions in the
Clubhouse tomorrow afternoon at 4.
Wilbur on Trial
Plans are currently being made by
the April 3rd Movement for a trial at
noon Friday of Wilbur Arroyo for
violation of the terms of the court
injunction.
Wilbur Arroyo, a Stanford dorm, was
included as one of the names on the
original injunction, apparently as an
oversight by the court processor.
In addition to these activities, an
organization called the "Friends to the
April 3rd Movement" is running an ad,
costing $163.80, in the Wall Street
Journal. The advertisement attempts to
discourage potential buyers of SRI by
pointing out the unstable investment
climate due to "insurgent activities on
the Stanford campus." The April 3rd
Movement favors tighter control, not
sale, of SRI.

We members of the staff of the
History of Western Civilization are
greatly disturbed by the threat to
academic freedom implicitly contained
in Section Five of the Temporary
Restraining Order which prohibits
suspended students, under penalty of
contempt of court, from attending
classes. Further, this provision of the
restraining order directly interferes with
the traditional autonomy of instructors
to decide on who shall or shall not be
allowed to audit his classes.
Therefore, we have decided that if
any of the 1,300 students presently
enrolled in our sections of History 3
should be found in contempt of court
on the basis of his presence in his
Western Civ class, we will refuse to turn
in our grade sheets for this course.

We members of the staff of the
History of Western Civilization are
greatly disturbed by the threat to
academic freedom implicitly contained
in Section Five of the Temporary
Restraining Order which prohibits
suspended students, under penalty of
contempt of court, from attending
classes. Further, this provision of the
restraining order directly interferes with
the traditional autonomy of instructors
to decide on who shall or shall not be
allowed to audit his classes.
Therefore, we have decided that if
any of the 1,300 students presently
enrolled in our sections of History 3
should be found in contempt of court
on the basis of his presence in his
Western Civ class, we will refuse to turn
in our grade sheets for this course.

Nine more students have been sent
notice of immediate, temporary
suspension as a result of their
participation in the occupation of
Encina Hall.
This brings to 69 the number of
students suspended until they appear
before the Stanford Judicial Council for
hearings on their part in the sit-in.
Four hearings on the Encina incident
have already been held. The Council
heard three of these last night, but the
decisions were not available before press
time.
One of the students originally
suspended, Ronald Barliant, was cleared
at the first hearing held by the Council.
He had entered the building only briefly
to arrange legal aid for the occupants of
the building.
Civ Protest
A strong protest against the Superior
Court temporary restraining order
which bars suspended students from
entering "any classroom, laboratory,
library or other academic building or
any administrative office building," was
issued by 19 of the 23 members of the
Western Civilization Staff.
In a letter to the Daily the
instructors declared that if the order is

enforced against any of their students,
they will refuse to turn in their grade
sheets. This would affect 1300 students,
(see text below)
A number of professors have also
joined in the protest against the
injunction by holding their classes
outdoors, thus allowing suspended
students to attend class without
entering an academic building.
General Meeting Tonight
Members of the April 3rd Movement,
meanwhile, have scheduled a general
meeting for tonight at 9:30 in Cubberly
Auditorium. The session is being called
a decision-making meeting to decide on
activities in preparation for Tuesday's
Trustee meeting.
The 9:30 general meeting will be
preceded at 7:30 by the film "The
Organizer," which is part of the
S DS-Resistance "Up Against the
Screen" film series.
There will also be a meeting of all
those students who have received
notification of suspensions in the
Clubhouse tomorrow afternoon at 4.
Wilbur on Trial
Plans are currently being made by
the April 3rd Movement for a trial at
noon Friday of Wilbur Arroyo for
violation of the terms of the court
injunction.
Wilbur Arroyo, a Stanford dorm, was
included as one of the names on the
original injunction, apparently as an
oversight by the court processor.
In addition to these activities, an
organization called the "Friends to the
April 3rd Movement" is running an ad,
costing $163.80, in the Wall Street
Journal. The advertisement attempts to
discourage potential buyers of SRI by
pointing out the unstable investment
climate due to "insurgent activities on
the Stanford campus." The April 3rd
Movement favors tighter control, not
sale, of SRI.
