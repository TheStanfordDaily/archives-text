## Arabs Besiege Lebanese Village 
### 
LEBANON [AP ]—About 2,000 Arab
guerrillas beseiged a Lebanese village
near the Israeli border yesterday and the
Beirut government accused a Syrian
commando outfit of masterminding the
assault.
A Lebanese communique said the
mountain village of Hasbaya, close to
the Israeli frontier, had been virtually
encircled by guerrillas of A 1
Saika—Thu nderbolt—affiliated with
Syria's ruling Baath party. There was no
word on casualites.
A 1 Fatah, the biggest Palestinian
guerrilla organization, claimed in a
broadcast from Cairo that five of its
men were killed by Lebanese troops on
their way to a sabotage mission into
Israel.
Lebanese military authorities
promptly denied A 1 Fatah's claim. The
Fatah broadcast said the sabotage unit
was surrounded and gunned down by
Lebanese troops "firing heavily with
various types of weapons."
Despite Beirut's denial, A 1 Fatah's
claim could mean more trouble for the
Lebanese government which has been
resisting guerrilla demands that it open
its southern borders for commando
forays into Israel. Lebanon fears Israeli
repirsals.

• Chemical Disposal
WASHINGTON [AP]-The Army
announced Wednesday tentative plans
to ship 27,000 tons of obsolete
chemical warfare bombs and agents by
train to the East coast to be hauled to
sea and sunk.
The proposal already is stirring
criticism in Congress with talk of the
dangers of handling poison gas—but the
Army insisted the shipment as well as
the disposal procedures can be safely
executed.
As outlined by Army officials, the
obsolete or unserviceable chemical
warfare agents dating back to World War
II would be loaded in a dozen or more
trains and moved crosscountry between
May and August.
The chemicals, about half Air Force
nerve gas bombs which are
self-contained and the rest Army
mustard gas and old tear gas in steel
cylinders, are now stored at the Rocky
Mountain, Colo., and Edgewood, Md.,
arsenals.

SAN FRANCISCO [APJ-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew said
Wednesday it is wrong to compare the
priorities given the Safeguard
Antiball istic Missile System with
priorities given domestic programs.
"They are not relevant," he said
during the question-answer portion of
his appearance before the
Commonwealth Club.
Agnew was asked whether it was
appropriate to give high financial
priority to the Safeguard System when
the Nixon administration has proposed
cutbacks in funds for housing and urban
development.
"No domestic program can be placed
on an equal footing with a program to
help us exist as a country," the vice
president said.
"We can spend billions on our cities,
but if they go up in a cloud of nuclear
dust, all would be lost," Agnew added.
A major portion of his address was
spent defending the proposed Safeguard
System.

• Chemical Disposal
WASHINGTON [AP]-The Army
announced Wednesday tentative plans
to ship 27,000 tons of obsolete
chemical warfare bombs and agents by
train to the East coast to be hauled to
sea and sunk.
The proposal already is stirring
criticism in Congress with talk of the
dangers of handling poison gas—but the
Army insisted the shipment as well as
the disposal procedures can be safely
executed.
As outlined by Army officials, the
obsolete or unserviceable chemical
warfare agents dating back to World War
II would be loaded in a dozen or more
trains and moved crosscountry between
May and August.
The chemicals, about half Air Force
nerve gas bombs which are
self-contained and the rest Army
mustard gas and old tear gas in steel
cylinders, are now stored at the Rocky
Mountain, Colo., and Edgewood, Md.,
arsenals.

SAN FRANCISCO [APJ-Vice
President Spiro T. Agnew said
Wednesday it is wrong to compare the
priorities given the Safeguard
Antiball istic Missile System with
priorities given domestic programs.
"They are not relevant," he said
during the question-answer portion of
his appearance before the
Commonwealth Club.
Agnew was asked whether it was
appropriate to give high financial
priority to the Safeguard System when
the Nixon administration has proposed
cutbacks in funds for housing and urban
development.
"No domestic program can be placed
on an equal footing with a program to
help us exist as a country," the vice
president said.
"We can spend billions on our cities,
but if they go up in a cloud of nuclear
dust, all would be lost," Agnew added.
A major portion of his address was
spent defending the proposed Safeguard
System.

LEBANON [AP ]—About 2,000 Arab
guerrillas beseiged a Lebanese village
near the Israeli border yesterday and the
Beirut government accused a Syrian
commando outfit of masterminding the
assault.
A Lebanese communique said the
mountain village of Hasbaya, close to
the Israeli frontier, had been virtually
encircled by guerrillas of A 1
Saika—Thu nderbolt—affiliated with
Syria's ruling Baath party. There was no
word on casualites.
A 1 Fatah, the biggest Palestinian
guerrilla organization, claimed in a
broadcast from Cairo that five of its
men were killed by Lebanese troops on
their way to a sabotage mission into
Israel.
Lebanese military authorities
promptly denied A 1 Fatah's claim. The
Fatah broadcast said the sabotage unit
was surrounded and gunned down by
Lebanese troops "firing heavily with
various types of weapons."
Despite Beirut's denial, A 1 Fatah's
claim could mean more trouble for the
Lebanese government which has been
resisting guerrilla demands that it open
its southern borders for commando
forays into Israel. Lebanon fears Israeli
repirsals.
