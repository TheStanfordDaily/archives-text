# A3M Calls Class Boycott To Support SRI Demands
## 
### CHRIS PECK 
In hopes of making some impression
on the Board of Trustees before their
scheduled meeting in San Francisco
Tuesday, the April 3rd Movement has
called for a campus-wide boycott of
classes. The boycott is scheduled for
Monday and Tuesday.
The April 3rd Movement called the
boycott to "mobilize support for
action," and to "gauge the sense of the

community," in the words of speakers
at a meeting last night. The majority of
the people attending the full house
meeting in Cubberley Auditorium
hoped a boycott would mobilize the
campus support tor the demands made
by A3M, especially those people who
have not been in agreement with recent
tactics, specifically the Encina Sit-in of
last week.
One change was made in the working
of the April 3rd demands. Instead of
"tighter control" of SRI, the Movement
now asks for "a closer relationship"
with the University.
Positive Movement
"A boycott is not coercive except
that it shows the number of people who
accept the deamands, "Paul Bernstein
emphasized, "We're trying to get people
to do something more than put an "X"
on a ballot in support of our demands,"
Bernstein continued.
The implications that the boycott
will raise were evident at last night's
meeting. The Movement felt that if the
Stanford community will not support
the two-day boycott, then the
community is no longer in sympathy
with the demands. "We are going to be
embarrassed if we have a boycott and
nobody comes," quipped Paul Rupert.
Outline Of Boycott
The boycott activities as were
generally outlined last night call for
students who support the boycott on
Monday to circulate among those
students who are not supporting the
boycott and disucssing the demands.

The Stanford local of the American
Federation of Teachers held a meeting
last night to discuss a possible strike.
Only thirty of the local's 80 members
were present and talk of a strike was put
off until further organizing could be
done.


CAMPUS CRUSADE—Members of the April 3rd Movement, and passersby 011 White Plaza,
have been treated to the exhortations of an alleged travelling Baptist minister "Hubert"
lately. Preaching against the evils of "socialism," he has been seeking converts among the
Stanford community. It is not known how much success he has had.
