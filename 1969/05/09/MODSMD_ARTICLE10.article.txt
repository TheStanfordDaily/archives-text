# West. Civ Letter Draws Criticism
## 
### 
Steps are being taken to ensure that
students enrolled in Western Civilization
will receive grades even if their
instructors do not submit them.
In a letter published in uesterday's
Daily, 19 of the 23 Civ instructors
signed a letter stating they would not
submit any grades for History 3 if any

student were stopped from taking the
course because he was suspended and
banned from classrooms.
Civ Director Paul Seaver last night
released a letter recommending to acting
Humanities and Sciences dean Halsey
Royden that "whatever body has
authority" give a "pass" grade to any
students whose instructors refuse to
submit grades (see text at the end of
this article).
In addition, four of the signers of
yesterday's letter have, in effect,
withdrawn their names, saying, "We
categorically reject any attempt to
withhold grades . . .we will give grades
in our sections." (See text at the end of
this article)
Furthermore, one name attached to
the original letter Robert Worrell,
should not have been listed. Mr. Worrell
did not sign the letter.

I believe that the decision taken by
19 instructors of the History of Western
Civilization staff yesterday and
expressed in a letter published in the
Stanford Daily, May 8, 1969, issued out
of a profound unhappiness with the
possible consequences of Section 5 of
the Temporary Restraining Order, an
unhappiness which I share.
However, I believe that the decision
to withhold grades from 1300 students
should any student in History 3 be
found in contempt of court on the basis
of his presence in his Western
Civilization class was both inappropriate
and wrong. I believe the action was
inappropriate because it employs a
device which is intended to record
