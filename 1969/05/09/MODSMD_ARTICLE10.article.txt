# West. Civ Letter Draws Criticism
## 
### 
Steps are being taken to ensure that
students enrolled in Western Civilization
will receive grades even if their
instructors do not submit them.
In a letter published in uesterday's
Daily, 19 of the 23 Civ instructors
signed a letter stating they would not
submit any grades for History 3 if any

student were stopped from taking the
course because he was suspended and
banned from classrooms.
Civ Director Paul Seaver last night
released a letter recommending to acting
Humanities and Sciences dean Halsey
Royden that "whatever body has
authority" give a "pass" grade to any
students whose instructors refuse to
submit grades (see text at the end of
this article).
In addition, four of the signers of
yesterday's letter have, in effect,
withdrawn their names, saying, "We
categorically reject any attempt to
withhold grades . . .we will give grades
in our sections." (See text at the end of
this article)
Furthermore, one name attached to
the original letter Robert Worrell,
should not have been listed. Mr. Worrell
did not sign the letter.

expressed in a letter published in the

of a profound unhappiness with the

the Temporary Restraining Order, an
unhappiness which I share.

should any student in History 3 be

inappropriate because it employs a
device which is intended to record
judgments concerning a student's
academic performance in order to
attempt to influence decisions
taken elsewhere in thecommnity.
I believe the action was wrong
because it threatens persons, our
students, who are neither
responsible for seeking the
injunction nor for enforcing it.
I therefore recommend that
whatever body has authority so to
empower me authorize me as
Director of the History and
Western Civilization program to
record a grade of pass for any
student enrolled in History 3
whose grade is withheld as a
consequence of the decision taken
by the nineteen instructors until
such a grade is turned in by the

Steps are being taken to ensure that
students enrolled in Western Civilization
will receive grades even if their
instructors do not submit them.
In a letter published in uesterday's
Daily, 19 of the 23 Civ instructors
signed a letter stating they would not
submit any grades for History 3 if any

student were stopped from taking the
course because he was suspended and
banned from classrooms.
Civ Director Paul Seaver last night
released a letter recommending to acting
Humanities and Sciences dean Halsey
Royden that "whatever body has
authority" give a "pass" grade to any
students whose instructors refuse to
submit grades (see text at the end of
this article).
In addition, four of the signers of
yesterday's letter have, in effect,
withdrawn their names, saying, "We
categorically reject any attempt to
withhold grades . . .we will give grades
in our sections." (See text at the end of
this article)
Furthermore, one name attached to
the original letter Robert Worrell,
should not have been listed. Mr. Worrell
did not sign the letter.
Seaver Letter
Professor Halsey I-. Royden, Dean
Humanities and Sciences, Stanford
University
I believe that the decision taken by
19 instructors of the History of Western
Civilization staff yesterday and
expressed in a letter published in the
Stanford Daily, May 8, 1969, issued out
of a profound unhappiness with the
possible consequences of Section 5 of
the Temporary Restraining Order, an
unhappiness which I share.
However, I believe that the decision
to withhold grades from 1300 students
should any student in History 3 be
found in contempt of court on the basis
of his presence in his Western
Civilization class was both inappropriate
and wrong. I believe the action was
inappropriate because it employs a
device which is intended to record
judgments concerning a student's
academic performance in order to
attempt to influence decisions
taken elsewhere in thecommnity.
I believe the action was wrong
because it threatens persons, our
students, who are neither
responsible for seeking the
injunction nor for enforcing it.
I therefore recommend that
whatever body has authority so to
empower me authorize me as
Director of the History and
Western Civilization program to
record a grade of pass for any
student enrolled in History 3
whose grade is withheld as a
consequence of the decision taken
by the nineteen instructors until
such a grade is turned in by the
instructor.

Editor, THE DAILY:
We instructors of Western
Civilization have reconsidered our
letter to the Daily (May 8) and
would like to restate our position.
We categorically reject any
attempt to withhold grades from
students in order to achieve ends
by threats and coercion; we will
give grades in our sections.
