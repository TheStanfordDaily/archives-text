# Agnew's Answer
## 
### 
On Wednesday, at a meeting of the
Commonwealth Club of San Francisco,
Spiro T. Agnew, Vice-President of the
United States, praised the Safeguard
anti-ballistic missile system and upheld the
government's pattern of defense spending.
Vice-President Agnew told his audience:
"No domestic problem, no matter how
critical it is, can be placed on an equal basis
with the continuance of our ability to exist
as a society."
By suggesting to his audience a scene in
which there were "no cities by reason of a
nuclear attack which we cannot respond to
or defend against," Agnew helped sustain
the atmosphere of war hysteria in which
America's munitions merchants have
thrived.
The urban crisis to which Agnew gave
second place is a consequence of the
decades-old decision to give the armaments
industry first priority in the American
economy.
This defense spending which has left the
cities of America neglected and in ruin is
the same spending which has corrupted
America's universities. Institutions of
higher learning are now part of a
nationalized knowledge industry in which
scientists and engineers improve American
proficiency in a technology of death and in
which social scientists spin apologies for an
unjust system."
"Guns" take away from "butter" even
in the comparatively wealthy country of

America. Young men slaving in America's
conscript legions are not contributing to
the productive efforts of American society.
America's permanent war economy
which Charles E. Wilson of General Motors
heralded back in 1944 has made us
accustomed to being producers of missiles
and submarines. It has given to American
colleges Boards of Trustees made up of
representatives of the military-industrial
complex.
Although the U.S. government has
thermonuclear megatonnage beyond
measure of destructiveness, Nixon and
Agnew would not have us falter in seeking
peace through preparedness.
Agnew told his San Francisco audience
that a "responsible majority" of the
nation's scientific community believes in
the workability of the new ABM system.
He defended the Safeguard program, calling
it "unprovocative." He also said it "would
not stimulate the arms race."
Such frequent straying from the paths
of truth has become commonplace with
America's leaders. The Nixon
administration's anti-missile gap may create
a credibility gap in the tradition of Nixon's
predecessor.
While the bombs rain on South Vietnam
and the guarantee profits flow to the
merchants of overkill, American urban
cores are rotten. The civilian economy is
depleted. The war is being brought home to
us all.

He defended the Safeguard program, calling
it "unprovocative." He also said it "would
not stimulate the arms race."
Such frequent straying from the paths
of truth has become commonplace with
America's leaders. The Nixon
administration's anti-missile gap may create
a credibility gap in the tradition of Nixon's
predecessor.
While the bombs rain on South Vietnam
and the guarantee profits flow to the
merchants of overkill, American urban
cores are rotten. The civilian economy is
depleted. The war is being brought home to
us all.
On Wednesday, at a meeting of the
Commonwealth Club of San Francisco,
Spiro T. Agnew, Vice-President of the
United States, praised the Safeguard
anti-ballistic missile system and upheld the
government's pattern of defense spending.
Vice-President Agnew told his audience:
"No domestic problem, no matter how
critical it is, can be placed on an equal basis
with the continuance of our ability to exist
as a society."
By suggesting to his audience a scene in
which there were "no cities by reason of a
nuclear attack which we cannot respond to
or defend against," Agnew helped sustain
the atmosphere of war hysteria in which
America's munitions merchants have
thrived.
The urban crisis to which Agnew gave
second place is a consequence of the
decades-old decision to give the armaments
industry first priority in the American
economy.
This defense spending which has left the
cities of America neglected and in ruin is
the same spending which has corrupted
America's universities. Institutions of
higher learning are now part of a
nationalized knowledge industry in which
scientists and engineers improve American
proficiency in a technology of death and in
which social scientists spin apologies for an
unjust system."
"Guns" take away from "butter" even
in the comparatively wealthy country of

America. Young men slaving in America's
conscript legions are not contributing to
the productive efforts of American society.
America's permanent war economy
which Charles E. Wilson of General Motors
heralded back in 1944 has made us
accustomed to being producers of missiles
and submarines. It has given to American
colleges Boards of Trustees made up of
representatives of the military-industrial
complex.
Although the U.S. government has
thermonuclear megatonnage beyond
measure of destructiveness, Nixon and
Agnew would not have us falter in seeking
peace through preparedness.
Agnew told his San Francisco audience
that a "responsible majority" of the
nation's scientific community believes in
the workability of the new ABM system.
He defended the Safeguard program, calling
it "unprovocative." He also said it "would
not stimulate the arms race."
