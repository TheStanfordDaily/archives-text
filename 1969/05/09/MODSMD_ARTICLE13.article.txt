# Letters To The Editor
## ROTC On Camp us Debated 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
(An open letter to the Stanford
community, originally addressed
to Mr. Warren Biggs, The
STANFORD Annual Fund.)
I have received your plaintive
calls for funds for the class of *32
Stanford Annual Fund.
While I agree with Wally's
often expressed point of view that
the alumni should not withhold
contributions from a university
because of the actions of a few
malcontents, right now I have had
it up to here- and then some. The
action taken in regard to ROTC
by the administration is
nauseating, to say the least.
For a school that once gave
credit for a source in fly casting, if
my memory serves me correctly,
this action seems beyond
comprehension. As a matter of
fact, there is hardly any way to
figure people who object to the
draft carrying their objections to
the point where they oppose the
efforts of those who wish to "do
their own thing" through ROTC
by volunteering to enter the
Service.
It would seem that "Academic
Freedom" is being supplanted by
"Academic Anarchy." In the old
Horse Cavalry we had a saying,
"you either ride the horse or the
horse rides you."
I appreciate your effort on the
part of Stanford and the class of
1932, but my contribution this
year will be limited to that
already given to the 3uck Club.
I might say that Stanford
meant more to me than anything
in my scholastic life. Of the 27
schools I have attended since the
6th grade thorugh my masters
degree, Stanford will always be
special. But I certainly can hope
that the administration and the
trustees can find some backbone
in support of those institutions,
including SRI that have been right
and are tight for our country.
Until they do, please count me
out.

• Fraud
Editor, THE DAILY:
FRAUD is a nasty word; I
would hesitate to use it against a
faculty member. However, when
John Felstiner of the English
Department recently criticized the
NROTC program (Letters, April
15), he alledged participation in
an officer procurement program
which simply does not exist. He
may or may not have served in the

Naval Service, but certainly not in
the status he claims. NROTC
scholarship students receive
regular commissions upon
graduation, then serve a minimum
of four years active duty; it has
been this way since the program
began. Since Mr. Felstiner made a
point of having served a shorter
period, lie and his "hundreds" of
fellows of similar "experience"
become less than credible
witnesses in an inquiry already
ridden with the bias of
preconceived opinion and popular
discontent concerning our foreign
policy.
If Stanford would question the
relevancy of ROTC in any or all
of its forms, why not poll
individuals with bonefide
backgrounds as military officers.

•A nomaly
Editor, THE DAILY:
Rather belatedly, I have
received reports that the
University has decided to
withdraw academic credit from
the ROTC programs. As a
graduate of both the University
and the program, I think this is a
very wise decision.
The program has been a
anomaly on the campus for a long
time. It is the bastard offspring of
a mesalliance between academy
and military that I doubt has lived
up to the expectations of either
party. As an officer, the ROTC
graduate generally has a lot to
learn that his counterpart from
OSC knew already.
The effects will, I think, be
beneficial to both parties. The
University's conscience will be a
little clearer (though not much,
there are still the classified
research projects for the
Academic Senate to mull over).
The program itself, which was fast
becoming moribund, may be
revised, after it recovers from
withdrawl symptoms, so that it is
more relevant and attractive to
potential officers.
Anyway, it is good to see the
winds blowing whether of
freedom or just of change.

• Another IT ay?
Editor, THE DAILY:
The April 26 issue of Saturday
Review contains an article on
CBW that merits quoting with

respect to controls on SRI
research as proposed by the Scott
Report or the April 3rd Coalition:
"Silence, programs under
wraps, the military operating in an
environment with no adequate
check because no one really
knows what's going on—this may
be the crux of the problem for
future action and control."
"CBW weapons are not alone
in posing this problem; perhaps
the most important deficiency in
the American policy process
today, especially that related to
armaments, is the absence of a
means of developing competence
and information outside the
government that can result in

relatively disinterested analyses of
issues and programs. When trying
to understand large-scale,
complex, technologically
sophisticated systems, the press or
the public or the Congress has
nowhere to turn but to those
most involved: the military or
industry. The country must find
alternatives."
An independent, not-for-profit
institute such as SRI can provide
such an alternative. The proposed
controls on our research would
make this service to the public
impossible.
