## Gaps Within Gaps 
### Art Buchwald 
What everyone is discovering in
the recent youth turmoil is that
there are generation gaps within
generation gaps. The "over 30"
distinction, as far as the
generation gap is concerned, is
passe and now only a few years
separate the groups that aren't
communicating with each other.
A 23-year-old friend of mine,
recently graduated from college,
said, "i don't know what's gotten
into the kids today in the
universities. I can't seem to get
through to them. Every time I try
to discuss things with them they
tell me I'm too old to understand
their problems, and people like
me are part of the corrupt system
that they are determined to
destroy. Even my kid brother says
li's hopeless to change my way of
thinking."
His kid brother, aged 19, came
in a little later. "At least we know
what we want out of life better
education, a say in the affairs of
the school, a right to choose our
own curriculum, no ROTC,
abolishment of the draft, an end
to the war in Vietnam, the
destruction of the
military-industrial complex and
the finish of the Dow Chemical
Co. But these 16- and 17-year-olds
don't know what the heck they

want. They're ready to tear down
everything. I really get frightened
when they get involved in our
demonstrations."
A 16-year-old neighbor
protested that his group was
moderate compared to the 14-
and 15-year-olds.
We're the ones, they say, who
messed things up and they're
going to do whatever they damn
please. 3ut when you ask them
what they want, they have no
idea."
Two 15-year-old students said,
"We know what we want. We
want the right to drive cars. Why
should the 16- and 17-year-olds be
given licenses? If we're old enough
to go to school, we're old enough
to drive. We're sick and tired of
the 16-year-olds treating us like
children. They better listen to us,
because if they don't they're
going to have to deal with the
13-year-olds, and heaven help
them if the 13-year-olds get the
upper hand."
"The 13-year-olds are pretty
bad?" I said.
"You hav« no idea. They're a
bunch of spoiled brats. They've
been given too much. Everything
comes to them on a silver platter.
A 13-year-old is hardly out of
diapers and he's trying to tell

teen-agers how to run their lives." '
I naturally sought out a
13-year-old to see if they were
having a generation gap.
"You bet your sweet bippy we
are. The subteen-agers are
disgusting. They say they should
liave as much to do with our
public school as the seniors. They
want to run the student council,
be on all the teams, go to our
dances, and they don't see why
they shouldn't graduate at 11 .
instead of 13. What they need is a
good beating."
I assumed the generation gap
would stop with 11-year-olds but
I was wrong. An 11-year-old
friend of my daughter said the
most hopeless, useless task was
trying to get through to the 8- and
9-year-olds.
"They ruin everything," she
said. "They wreck the school bus,
they're always making noise, they
use dirty language and they're
mean. Ugh."
I saw a 9-year-old the next day,
and he confirmed how serious the
generation gap had become.
"If you think we're bad," he
said, throwing a rock at a cat,
"You should see the kids in
kindergarten."

9-year-olds.
"They ruin everything," she
said. "They wreck the school bus,
they're always making noise, they
use dirty language and they're
mean. Ugh."
I saw a 9-year-old the next day,
and he confirmed how serious the
generation gap had become.
"If you think we're bad," he
said, throwing a rock at a cat,
"You should see the kids in
kindergarten."
What everyone is discovering in
the recent youth turmoil is that
there are generation gaps within
generation gaps. The "over 30"
distinction, as far as the
generation gap is concerned, is
passe and now only a few years
separate the groups that aren't
communicating with each other.
A 23-year-old friend of mine,
recently graduated from college,
said, "i don't know what's gotten
into the kids today in the
universities. I can't seem to get
through to them. Every time I try
to discuss things with them they
tell me I'm too old to understand
their problems, and people like
me are part of the corrupt system
that they are determined to
destroy. Even my kid brother says
li's hopeless to change my way of
thinking."
His kid brother, aged 19, came
in a little later. "At least we know
what we want out of life better
education, a say in the affairs of
the school, a right to choose our
own curriculum, no ROTC,
abolishment of the draft, an end
to the war in Vietnam, the
destruction of the
military-industrial complex and
the finish of the Dow Chemical
Co. But these 16- and 17-year-olds
don't know what the heck they

want. They're ready to tear down
everything. I really get frightened
when they get involved in our
demonstrations."
A 16-year-old neighbor
protested that his group was
moderate compared to the 14-
and 15-year-olds.
We're the ones, they say, who
messed things up and they're
going to do whatever they damn
please. 3ut when you ask them
what they want, they have no
idea."
Two 15-year-old students said,
"We know what we want. We
want the right to drive cars. Why
should the 16- and 17-year-olds be
given licenses? If we're old enough
to go to school, we're old enough
to drive. We're sick and tired of
the 16-year-olds treating us like
children. They better listen to us,
because if they don't they're
going to have to deal with the
13-year-olds, and heaven help
them if the 13-year-olds get the
upper hand."
"The 13-year-olds are pretty
bad?" I said.
"You hav« no idea. They're a
bunch of spoiled brats. They've
been given too much. Everything
comes to them on a silver platter.
A 13-year-old is hardly out of
diapers and he's trying to tell

teen-agers how to run their lives." '
I naturally sought out a
13-year-old to see if they were
having a generation gap.
"You bet your sweet bippy we
are. The subteen-agers are
disgusting. They say they should
liave as much to do with our
public school as the seniors. They
want to run the student council,
be on all the teams, go to our
dances, and they don't see why
they shouldn't graduate at 11 .
instead of 13. What they need is a
good beating."
I assumed the generation gap
would stop with 11-year-olds but
I was wrong. An 11-year-old
friend of my daughter said the
most hopeless, useless task was
trying to get through to the 8- and
9-year-olds.
"They ruin everything," she
said. "They wreck the school bus,
they're always making noise, they
use dirty language and they're
mean. Ugh."
