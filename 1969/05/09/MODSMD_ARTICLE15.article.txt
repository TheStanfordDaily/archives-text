## A 						Fast For The Movement 
### Terry Fitzgerald 
There have been at least fifty articles and letters on the April Third
Movement, Encina, AEL and Stanford Research Institute on these
pages during this week, and I suppose that many people aren't
particularly interested in reading another. But as one of those who have
been living on water since Monday and will continue to fast and
maintain a vigil until May 13, I think I have the right to say a few words
and to be heard.
So where to start? I guess the fast is a good place —the fast and what
you think about it (if you bother to think, but that's another topic). I
know damn well that there are a lot of people who think we are being
very nice by using a fast to express our views. For those of you who
do—you're crazier than hell. If you think we're sitting in front of the
President's office starving ourselves in order to be 'nice,' you gotta be
crazy. We're here because people are dying and people will die and
we're killing them. That's right pal. You and I are killing them. We are
accomplices before, after, and during the fact. Get that into your head.
People—Human beings.
Human beings—dead. i<
Courtesy of you and me.
THAT's what it's all about. THAT'S what I think the April Third
Movement is all about. THAT's why we issued our demands (Lord, I
hate that word) on April Third, and THAT's why we occupied AEL on
April 9. Human beings, baby, Dead human beings (and very possibly
you among them, unless we change our directions).
THAT is why we are in front of the office starving and freezing and
damn near getting run over by police scooters and power sweepers and
totally screwing ourselves in school.
Now you, my friends, are supposed to take a hint from all this. And

that is that you can not, you must not —if you lay any claim to human
Qualities ignoring the issues. Oh sure, you can go on in what I've seen
to be the Stanford way of life —an external sameness with little
celebration of life and little solemn reflection and no connection of
you;life and your actions with the outside world (like: Good Friday,
the Anniversary ol Martin Luther King's assassination, the second day
of Passover so Roble holds a big party). "I never even thought of it"
typical answer. Yes, you can go that way—and those people will go on
dying and continue to starve and this bloody world will continue to
find new ways to destroy itself.
Shit. What can I say. The Trustees can ignore us and you can ignore
us and shit—People, baby, dead human beings.
When Art Melville was here he told us something that relates to all of
this. "If this Movement comes to violence," he said, "it is our fault. It is
the fault of those of us, those concerned ones of us who refuse to take
action and who thus force action upon those few who are dedicated.
But action by a few can and will be repressed and thus enters the
danger of violence." Contrary to those shedding tears over the damned
windows, this Movement has not come to violence (except perhaps the
paranoia which took over Wednesday night and is actually a more
violent thing than any broken glass). But if it does come to violence,
consider who is to blame, pal, and ask where you were when the call
went out. If this movement comes to violence, it's our fault, baby.
What for? Human life.

fifth. A member of the April Third Movement, he terms himself as
