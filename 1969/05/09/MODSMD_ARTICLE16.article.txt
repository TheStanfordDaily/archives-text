## The 						Relevance Call 
### Richard S. Sorbello 
The calls to "relevance" being
directed at the University
scientific community are
seductive, but potentially
disastrous. As an expression of the
relevance syndrome, these voices
beckon us to integrate Stanford
and SRI into a center for
top-priority socially relevant
research. The latent disaster is
that in an attempt to judge the
value and support of research on
the basis of its "relevance" we are
slipping back into the very same
muck from which we should be
trying to fight free—that is, the
regarding of university research as
a mail-order product serving the
immediate needs and whims of
the consumer. The consumer,
whether the Military or the
Movement, sends his order to the
university scientist, who then
dutifully delivers the product
usually with a money-back
guarantee).

II university scientists want to \
be in this retail-trade bag—fine,
let's go right in business, merge -
with SRI, Hewlett-Packard, and
everything else in sight. We might
then show Mr. Ling and his
conglomerate Frankenstein a
thing or two about innovation,
distribution, and cost-effective
ness. It is possible, however, that
scientific research at a university
should be somewhat more
daring—less a consumer perishable
and more a developing of our
knowledge and consciousness. J
Perhaps the university itself
should be less a factory and more
a place to interact, to question,
perchance to dream.
Indeed, insistence on massive
consumer-relevant research is a
violent blow to the brainstem of
the university, and bound to
distort perspective and destroy
sensitivity. Consumer A might
desire radar jammers and
zirconium bombs. Consumer B, i
on the other hand, might desire
that SLAC be disassembled and
that the researchers there be put
to work building outhouses in the
hills of the Third World. Certainly "r
outhouses satisfy an urgent
pressing need, but it is just
possible that outhouses are also
not the place for the University to
put its assets.
Let us at the University
establish our independence, and
spurn the lusting she-wolves of
militarism and "relevance." What
is imperative is that intellectual
freedom tempered with simple
human decency survive in the
University, lest we all slide further
into the fetid malabolgia of
consumer worship.
