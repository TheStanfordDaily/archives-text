## S.P. Timoshenko's ‘As I Remember’ 
### James Harvey 
Stephen P. Timoshenko, the
father of engineering mechanics,
has lived a life filled with intense
academic and engineering interests
superimposed upon his travelings
throughout America, Europe, and
his native Russia.
Born the son of a Ukrainian
landowner in 1878, Timoshenko
was educated in Russia and
Germany, fled from Bolshevik
Russia to Yugoslavia in 1920, and
arrived in America in 1922. His
professorship at Stanford
University from 1936 to 1944 was
just the final ripening of a rich
academic life.
His reminiscences weave a
complex web of scientific and
practical work, acquaintances, and
travels; these recollections are set
down in a precise, subtly
humanistic manner in his
autobiography, As 1 Remember
(D. Van Nostrand Company, Inc.
1968). First published in Paris in
1963, the present edition was
translated from the Russian by
Robert Addis.
Professor Timoshenko, a true
member of the "old school" of
life, loves the intellectual, refined
life. He is superficially
dispassionate in that he bases his
human value system on how
people deal with one
an other — especially
"foreigners"—in their day-to-day
dealings with each other; he
attaches no significance to the
outward "attentions and
kindnesses" in which they
occasionally indulge.
Timoshenko's dislike for the
ostentatious leads him to tell his

story through objectively relating
hundreds of incidents, involving
hundreds of people, which have
composed the mosaic of his life.
Human Hypocrisy
In considering human
hypocrisy, Timoshenko is
especially wary of the
"shopkeeper mentality" he
encountered in America which
dictates being obsequious towards
prospective buyers and indifferent
towards others. His personal
experiences revealed an
"underlying harshness" of French
people and an "aloofness" of the
English which he also dislikes.
Strangely, aside from his fellow
Russians, only in the disciplined,
businesslike Germans does
Timoshenko find the fundamental
humanity and love of other
people he himself feels.
His respect and affection for
the German people is related
through encounters with German
scholars, military officers, and
even a dedicated librarian who
was "willing to take the time to
help a curious outsider." He tells
of incidents in Germany when he
was a student. "A completely
unknown young man," he writes,
"was able, with no formalities
whatever, to drop by the
reception room of the most
outstanding German scholars and
there receive a friendly welcome
and offers to show him around
the laboratories and acquaint
him with the principal scientific
work going on in them." English
scientists, on the contrary, were
considerably less open about their
work.

A few years before the
Bolshevik take-over of Russia, the
German army occupied Kiev,
where Timoshenko was then
living. The city had been filthy,
economically stagnant, and
clogged with deserters from the
Russian army for months—all of
which suddenly ended with the
arrivai of the highly-organized
German troops. "A great thing is
discipline," he exclaims in
recollection. He recalls with
anguish that in later years the
magnificent German sense of
kindness would be lost in the
anti-Semitic teachings of a
totalitarian regime; the German
capacity for organization would
be misused to distort a
dissatisfaction with the
permeation of the upper echelons
of German society by the
"essentially alien" Jewish culture
to a methodical campaign of
anti-Semitic terror and genocide.
Values y uielutle
Timoshenko values peaceful
quietude as the best environment
for scientific work as well as for
most of life's other activities. His
writing reflects this. He related
even remarkable events with a
minimum of emotion. A few
decisive words serve to reveal
Timoshenko's feeling of a person,
institution, or incident. There are
none of the philosophical
anecdotes of Benjamin Franklin
or the troubled self-analyses of J.
Robert O ppenheimer—just
Timoshenko and his experiences.
He feels great joy in first seeing
the magnificent city of
Constantinople, great indignation

at the "incredibly rough"
treatment of Russian refugees
during a French ship inspection,
and great sorrow at the passing of
his wife in his later life. Even such
moments as these, however, elicit
few words of emotion from the
pen of Timoshenko. His decision
to stay in America after spending
a "trial summer" here in 1922 was
based largely on material
considerations and put him at
odds with much of what he valued
in the established refinements of
European society. Of this
tortuous decision he merely
reflects, "Whether I chose rightly
or wrongly, 1 don't know even
now, after some forty years."
Aside from his own scientific
and engineering efforts, teaching
others was otie of the central
satisfactions and shaping factors
of his life. This, as his profound
passion for people who treat
others well, is such a central fact
of his character that it is never
written of in great detail but is
felt through the incidents he
reveals.
Tribute
That many of his former
students in Russia were willing to
give him political aid in the
dangerous and troubled times of
the Russian Revolution is in itself
a tribute to the respect he earned
as an instructor. A problem book
he wrote while teaching at the
Ways of Communication Institute
in Russia before the revolution
was so thoughtfully written that it
was still in use when he toured
Russia in 1958. His dissatisfaction
with the "strikingly coarse and
ill-mannered" students at the
University of Michigan after
teaching there for nearly a decade
before coming to Stanford,
undoubtedly soured his opinion
of that institution. Also, when he
first arrived at Stanford he felt
rebuffed because some
engineering professors did not
wish to discuss their teaching
methods with him. He was,
however, more pleased with the
engineering students at Stanford,
who seemed more interested in
learning. Finally, the American
penchant for teaching "how to do
a calculation rather than why it
works" was a constant irritation
to Timoshenko's sense of teaching
duty. Teaching, to Timoshenko,
was an important means of
communication between people;
he was concerned that it be
honestly and properly done.
Democracy is another value

which Timoshenko feels very
deeply while rejecting what he
sees as its more extreme
superficial manifestations, As a
student in Czarist Russia, he
supported leftist demands for
political liberties and even helped
with leafleting and raising funds.
While working as a railroad
construction engineer in Russia,
he insisted on strict compliance
with the food and housing
benefits workers were supposed to
receive from contractors. He
disagreed, however, with notions
so radical as the confiscation of
private property for public use.
He was in St Petersburg during
the bloodless coup which gave the
Bolsheviks power there and
witnessed many cowardly acts by
revolutionaries. Years later many
"heroes of the revolution"
claimed to have gained glory on
the "battlefields" at St.
Petersburg. This historical
distortion caused him to lose "any
interest or belief in the colorful
descriptions of the heroic deeds of
the people in revolt."
Also, the "democratization ol
scientific expositions disgusts him.
In the Paris Exposition of 1900,
the student Timoshenko marveled
at exhibits that were designed for
specialists in various fields. At the
motors-and-engines exhibit, for
instance, the latest developments
in steam-powered machines were
displayed. As a touring Stanford
Professor in 1937, he again visited
a Paris exposition - a democratized
exposition designed for the man
in the street. "The focus of
attention," he recalls, "was on
various contrived spectables and
endless cheap restaurants which
poisoned the atmosphere with
their kitchen stenches."
Timoshenko's discussion of the
historical perspective of his own
work and that of his
contemporaries gives the book
special significance to those
concerned with science and
engineering. As the
straight-forward story of a great
thinker and a well-traveled man,
however, As I Remember is of
interest to all.
(This review was originally
written by Mr. Harvey for the
STANFORD ENGINEERING
NEWS, in which it was published
in January, 1969. Timoshenko
completed his career as a
professor at Stanford. Stanford's
engineering mechanics lab is
named after him.
