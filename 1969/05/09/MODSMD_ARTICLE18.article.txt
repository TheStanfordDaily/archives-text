# An Open Letter
## One Alum's View 
### Cecil F. Rospaw 
Buried in the files stores in the
shiny new building from which
the "Dippy" is not edited are
copies from an earlier era which
do contain some signed comment
by the undersigned while we were
on the staff a few years back.
We once discussed better
housing as one method of
combatting communism and while
we have never changed our
opinion we did learn about how
people react to certain types of
ideas.
We also expressed our opinions
then about race relations and
while they have not changed
through the years, we find our
critics have.
We took our son to a
USC—Stanford game earlier this
year. (Our daughter is already lost
in the wilds of Troyville.)
Stanford won the game but lost
the battle in our family as only
USC remembered that it is
traditional to play the school alma
mater after the game.
"One of the purposes of social
change is to find new solutions
that will preserve old values . .
said former HEW Secretary John
Gardner recently during the
Godkin lectures at the former
Stanford of the East, Harvard.
(They still seem to have a lot in
common.)
When I first went to Stanford
as a freshman it was from a home
where guns had not been kept or
used. My mother had been a
delegate to the National Peace
Conference of 1940 from
California, and that atmosphere
prevailed.
Yet ROTC was available to
students then on a voluntary
basis, and for many of us provided

our only basic guide concerning
what was to come when our
country was attacked and the
class of 1945 when off, en masse,
into service throughout the world.
This is not the first generation
of students to face decisions. It
was during that time at Stanford
that sororities vanished, and
students were involved and
discussion, npt. violence, was
there, as was dissent.
Other social change was
discussed and asked for.
Many of us are pleased to see
some of things discussed then, a
fact today.
But a university is for all and
for all ideas. Who is to say that
another Dec. 7th is not in the
offing for another class of 1945.
Just as it takes two sides to make
war, so does it take two to make
peace.
If it is the will of Stanford to
deny future students choice
concerning such matters as ROTC
then it is also within the choice of
alumni and friends to choose

where and how to lend their
support.
If it is the aim of Stanford
today to remain only in today,
and to cut ties with both
yesterday and tomorrow the
student body is certainly on the
right path.
Yesterday is gone and
tomorrow will never come.
