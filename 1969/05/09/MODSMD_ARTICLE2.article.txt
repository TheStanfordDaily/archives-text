# A3M Movement
## 
### 
"During the past five weeks the April
3rd Movement has demanded and
actively worked for the retention of SRI
and the elimination of CBW,
counterinsurgency, classified Southeast
Asian and war-related research, both at
SRI and at Stanford. Thousands of
students and faculty support these just
demands. We believe that a two-day
class boycott will allow the community
to express the seriousness with which
these demands are made. The purpose
of the boycott is not to minimize the
importance of classes, but to emphasize
the extraordinary importance of the
issues. It is imperative that the Board of
Trustees understand that the
community not only approves of these
demands but seeks to implement them.
We urge all students and faculty to join
the two-day boycott and to attend the
planned activities of the Movement. We
urge the Trustees to respond to the
community's wishes."
