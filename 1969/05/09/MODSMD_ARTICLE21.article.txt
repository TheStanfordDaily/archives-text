# Minority Students' Enrollment Increases Under Task Force
## 
### 
Twice <ts many disadvantaged
minority students will be
admitted to Stanford next year
under the aegis of the student
financed, student managed Task
Force Program.
The Task Force head,
Christopher Murlas announced
that the University lias decided to
accept 21 new students for the
following academic year. All of
these students will be requiring
some sort of scholarship aid.
Murlas is sending out a letter next
week requesting student
contributions to finance this aid.
The money will go to the
Martin Luther Kind Fund which
was started last year in response
to King's death. It will replace, as
it did last year, the Senior Class
Fund Drive. Contributions to the
King Fund will be solicited from
the entire Stanford Community.

The Task Force program had its
origin in the Spring of 196H after
the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King. At that time there
were about 150 Afro-Americans,
less than 20 Mexican-Americans,
and no more than a handful of
American Indians in Stanford's
enrollment of approximately
11,500 including undergraduates
and graduate students.
Task Force Members
The Task Force is made-up of
faculty, adadministrators, and
students from minority groups. It
is responsible for establishing
policies and procedures, as well as
selecting the minority students
who are to be admitted. The
students considered by the Task
Force Admissions Committee are
mainly those who applied to

Stanford and were refused
admission for academic reasons.
The Force also recruits students
through the help of present
Stanford minority students.
The most salient characteristic
of the program is that a flexible
admissions policy is applied to
certain minority group students.
The basic objective of the Task
Force Program is to determine
what, if any, factors other than
SAT's, GPA's, and class rank are
essential for academic success at
Stanford. Two indices considered
are: ideals which transcend the
applicant's own self-interest; and
the ability to overcome personal
problems and social barriers.
Once admitted, the minority
student becomes a regular
member of the freshman class.
There are no special courses,
teachers, counselors, etc. Every
effort is made to keep the identity
of the students from faculty,
students, and others. The only
special effort is a one-to-one
tutoring program. But enough
freshmen, who were regular
admits, receive tutoring so that

the Task Force students do not
feel they have been specialized.
The Task Force Admissions
Committee admitted eleven (11)
students in the academic year
(196H-69). Early in the Fall one
student voluntarily withdrew
from the program for personal
reasons.

At the beginning of Spring
Quarter ten (10) Task Force
students remained. As a group,
these students have achieved a
grade point average considerably
higher than that which had been
predicted. The Task Force
Admissions Committee with the
approval of the Provost's Office
has decided to double the number
of students for next academic
year (1969-70)
The Task Force Committee is
confident that in addition to
identifying specific students who
would otherwise be excluded
from Stanford, this program will
provide important information to
the Stanford Office of Admissions
to be considered in establishing
admissions criteria.

At the beginning of Spring
Quarter ten (10) Task Force
students remained. As a group,
these students have achieved a
grade point average considerably
higher than that which had been
predicted. The Task Force
Admissions Committee with the
approval of the Provost's Office
has decided to double the number
of students for next academic
year (1969-70)
The Task Force Committee is
confident that in addition to
identifying specific students who
would otherwise be excluded
from Stanford, this program will
provide important information to
the Stanford Office of Admissions
to be considered in establishing
admissions criteria.

Twice <ts many disadvantaged
minority students will be
admitted to Stanford next year
under the aegis of the student
financed, student managed Task
Force Program.
The Task Force head,
Christopher Murlas announced
that the University lias decided to
accept 21 new students for the
following academic year. All of
these students will be requiring
some sort of scholarship aid.
Murlas is sending out a letter next
week requesting student
contributions to finance this aid.
The money will go to the
Martin Luther Kind Fund which
was started last year in response
to King's death. It will replace, as
it did last year, the Senior Class
Fund Drive. Contributions to the
King Fund will be solicited from
the entire Stanford Community.

The Task Force program had its
origin in the Spring of 196H after
the assassination of Dr. Martin
Luther King. At that time there
were about 150 Afro-Americans,
less than 20 Mexican-Americans,
and no more than a handful of
American Indians in Stanford's
enrollment of approximately
11,500 including undergraduates
and graduate students.
Task Force Members
The Task Force is made-up of
faculty, adadministrators, and
students from minority groups. It
is responsible for establishing
policies and procedures, as well as
selecting the minority students
who are to be admitted. The
students considered by the Task
Force Admissions Committee are
mainly those who applied to

Stanford and were refused
admission for academic reasons.
The Force also recruits students
through the help of present
Stanford minority students.
The most salient characteristic
of the program is that a flexible
admissions policy is applied to
certain minority group students.
The basic objective of the Task
Force Program is to determine
what, if any, factors other than
SAT's, GPA's, and class rank are
essential for academic success at
Stanford. Two indices considered
are: ideals which transcend the
applicant's own self-interest; and
the ability to overcome personal
problems and social barriers.
Once admitted, the minority
student becomes a regular
member of the freshman class.
There are no special courses,
teachers, counselors, etc. Every
effort is made to keep the identity
of the students from faculty,
students, and others. The only
special effort is a one-to-one
tutoring program. But enough
freshmen, who were regular
admits, receive tutoring so that

the Task Force students do not
