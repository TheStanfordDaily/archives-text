# SRI Symposium
## Staff Supports Severance 
### 
Wide support for severance of Stanford Research
Institute from the University was voiced by most
speakers at a symposium of Stanford faculty and
SRl's professional staff, sponsored by the American
Association of University Professors Wednesday
night.
"To survive, to perform the function in society
and for human welfare set forth in our charter, we
must be independent," SRI molecular physicist
Felix Smith declared.
"There is no time for further studies, no time for
a summer's love—in of a joint faculty-SRI
committee. We face real life in a rough and tumble
world, and the time has come to end the family
party and say goodbye."
His remarks brought applause from the audience
of nearly 200, a majority of whom came from SRI.
Howard Vollmer, manager of SRl's management
and organizational development program, said
"until we are separate but equal from the
University, we'll never be able to work together."
Drawing a direct analogy with black-white relations,
he added: "Integration (of SRI into the University)
on your terms would mean accepting status as
second-class citizens."
No faculty member has seriously suggested any
SRI personnel be admitted to the Senate of the
Academic Council, or share other faculty privileges.
"We'd like to work with students, but how can we
with those kinds of faculty attitudes?" he asked, to
applause.
Elected Staff
Martin Gorfinkel, SRI mathematical statistician
and former Democratic State Assembly candidate,
said University ties are less important than SRl's
internal organization. He advocated an elected staff

"Senate" to provide overall policy guidance lor the
Institute's research programs.
Noting that this was the first general meeting
with research with Stanford faculty members, he
said "there's far too little discussion" of the kinds
and quality of research SRI does, which is
"sometimes very poor."
Gorfinkel said "there's almost unanimous
opinion on the SRI staff favoring severance." In
part this stems from the fact that nobody has
spelled out the details of any closer relationship and
from apprehension that students are going to come
and sit on SRl's doorstep, passing judgment on
every project there.
Rather than banning broad categories of
research, Gorfinkel said "I'd rather see some of the
'objectionable' contracts around SRI rather off
whore no one sees them."
Ehrlich's Attack
Paul Ehrlich, outspoken Stanford population
biologist, received strong applause for a biting
attack on Defense Department domination of
research expenditures.
"Over the past 20 years we've gone steadily
downhill," in trying to work for change within the
defense establishment, he said.
"How many people plugged into this $40 billion
pipeline that feeds them will be able to change it?"
Ehrlich asked. If the University kept SRI it could
provide some protection from cutbacks in defense
spending, he added. Referring to the Defense
Department, Ehrlich said: "We've got to cut those
b s off from the universities. We've got to get
that (source of funding) changed.
"Students have prodded us a long way toward
that, although I don't approve of all their tactics."

Noting that this was the first general meeting
with research with Stanford faculty members, he
said "there's far too little discussion" of the kinds
and quality of research SRI does, which is
"sometimes very poor."
Gorfinkel said "there's almost unanimous
opinion on the SRI staff favoring severance." In
part this stems from the fact that nobody has
spelled out the details of any closer relationship and
from apprehension that students are going to come
and sit on SRl's doorstep, passing judgment on
every project there.
Rather than banning broad categories of
research, Gorfinkel said "I'd rather see some of the
'objectionable' contracts around SRI rather off
whore no one sees them."
Ehrlich's Attack
Paul Ehrlich, outspoken Stanford population
biologist, received strong applause for a biting
attack on Defense Department domination of
research expenditures.
"Over the past 20 years we've gone steadily
downhill," in trying to work for change within the
defense establishment, he said.
"How many people plugged into this $40 billion
pipeline that feeds them will be able to change it?"
Ehrlich asked. If the University kept SRI it could
provide some protection from cutbacks in defense
spending, he added. Referring to the Defense
Department, Ehrlich said: "We've got to cut those
b s off from the universities. We've got to get
that (source of funding) changed.
"Students have prodded us a long way toward
that, although I don't approve of all their tactics."
Wide support for severance of Stanford Research
Institute from the University was voiced by most
speakers at a symposium of Stanford faculty and
SRl's professional staff, sponsored by the American
Association of University Professors Wednesday
night.
"To survive, to perform the function in society
and for human welfare set forth in our charter, we
must be independent," SRI molecular physicist
Felix Smith declared.
"There is no time for further studies, no time for
a summer's love—in of a joint faculty-SRI
committee. We face real life in a rough and tumble
world, and the time has come to end the family
party and say goodbye."
His remarks brought applause from the audience
of nearly 200, a majority of whom came from SRI.
Howard Vollmer, manager of SRl's management
and organizational development program, said
"until we are separate but equal from the
University, we'll never be able to work together."
Drawing a direct analogy with black-white relations,
he added: "Integration (of SRI into the University)
on your terms would mean accepting status as
second-class citizens."
No faculty member has seriously suggested any
SRI personnel be admitted to the Senate of the
Academic Council, or share other faculty privileges.
"We'd like to work with students, but how can we
with those kinds of faculty attitudes?" he asked, to
applause.
Elected Staff
Martin Gorfinkel, SRI mathematical statistician
and former Democratic State Assembly candidate,
said University ties are less important than SRl's
internal organization. He advocated an elected staff

"Senate" to provide overall policy guidance lor the
Institute's research programs.
