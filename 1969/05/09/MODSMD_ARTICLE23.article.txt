# Women's Education
## Faculty Wives Enroll 
### 
"A woman shouldn't have to
just get that B.A. and walk out
the door. Her education should
last from her freshman year until
she dies," stated Mrs. Richard
(Jing) Lyman in a discussion at
the Y Open Forum lunch
yesterday noon.
Mrs. Lyman, graduate of
Swarthmore and mother of four,
addressed the group on
"Education of Women: Under and
Over Twenty-Five." She, as a
member of the Faculty Women's
Club, is involved in the
development of a program of
continuing part-time education
for faculty wives at Stanford.
A pilot program is being
planned by Mrs. Lyman and other
faculty wives for next year to
provide for 10 faculty wives to
enter Stanford as fully accredited
students for part-time.
Flexible Tuition
"Right now there is no
flexibility on the tuition scale
other than half or full tuition,"
explains Mrs Lyman. In the new
program tuition would vary
directly with the number of
classes the women take. The ten
wives, to be selected from the 700
to whom questionnaires have been
sent, would pay their own tuition.
If the pilot program is
successful, the women have
long-range plans which would
include similar opportunities for
former Stanford students and
women in the Bay Area.
"Women's life cycle has
changed greatly in the last few

years. Women today have the
potential to be fully productive
for 20-40 years," feels Mrs.
Lyman.
What Mrs. Lyman pictures is a
pattern of long-term education
which would allow women to go
to college, drop out when they
choose to have a family, keep up
in a certain area while raising the
children, and return to school for
further study and more
specialized education.
"The children are all in school
and suddenly a woman has a
lot of time and not much
direction," relates Mrs. Lyman.
"You've lost your confidence to
do something on the outside— you
don't know what to do or really
what you want. Counselling at
this stage becomes of critical
importance."
Counselling Program
"I would like to see a
counselling program—but one
which would involve younger
women too who aren't faced with
the crisis yet. By recognizing the
problem, they could begin to
make provisions for their own
futures."
A symposium to explore the
issue of women's education and
counselling is also being organized
for the summer of 1970. It would
involve alumni, faculty wives,
staff women, students, and
representatives from the Bay
Area.
''If the counselling
(information on job and
education opportunities for

women) could extend to the
whole Bay community, we might
be able to get federal assistance,"
speculates Mrs. Lyman.
"In this era of high mobility of
professors between schools, few
institutional ties develop. Taking
courses at Stanford would help
build roots and give the women a
sense of involvement."
"Students could also be helped
by a program like this," states
Mrs. Lyman. "In terms of
association with women who
already have families. They will
lend a new perspective to the
school. The best kind ol
education is always 2-way."
Mrs. Lyman feels that Alberta
Siegel's SES report on Education
of Women at Stanford has had a
big influence on her proposals.
Mrs. Lyman supports the plans for
the establishment of a committee
to "keep an eye on" the relevancy
of education for Stanford women.
"We should consider ways that
the curriculum may be changed to
be more fruitful for women
students." Copies of the SES
report are available in the SES
office in room 2-A.
During the last year, Mrs.
Lyman has been involved in the
production of two booklets to aid
women in jobs and education.
"Going Into Labor —A Bay Area
Women's Guide Lo Employment
and Education" sells for $1.
"Continuing Education—The
Woman's Selective Guide to
Continuing Education in the Bay
Area" sells for $.50.
