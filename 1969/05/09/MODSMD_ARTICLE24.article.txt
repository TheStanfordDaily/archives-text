By THE ASSOCIATED PRESS
A fire described as incendiary
swept through a building at City
College in New York (CCCNY)
Thursday and destroyed an
auditorium. The fire broke out
after an explosion in a closet, a
fire official said.
The fire broke out as City
College reopened in disarray and
as CCNY President Buell G.
Gallagher said "adventurers in
guerilla tactics" had taken over
from responsible black and Puerto
Rican students.
The blaze, described as
incendiary by Assistant Fire
Marshal Patrick Crowley,
destroyed the Arnow Auditorium
of the Goldmark Wing of the
Finley Student Center on the
strife-ravaged South Campus.
The blaze enveloped the
auditorium in the large, rambling
red brick building, which also
houses classrooms and meeting
rooms.
Exams Cancelled
Gallagher also announced that
the campus disruptions had forced
him to cancel the final
examination period and to alter
the usual grading system.
Heavy New York City police
details were on duty on the upper
Manhattan campus in the wake of
Wednesday's bloody clash
between Negro and white students
in which seven white students
suffered head wounds.
Ten Negroes, including four
girls, staged a hit-and-run
vandalism attack in one building
and disrupted classes. Some
classes were cancelled, fire alarms
rang, white students wearing red
armbands marched about the
campus and others ran through
buildings.
About 200 protesters faced j
about 200 counter
demonstrators—but the groups
were kept apart by police. Both
groups staged rallies.
Police took three youths into |

custody after breaking up a fight
between white and Negro youths
on campus.
Cornell
Elsewhere in the nation's
continuing campus turmoil, about
130 members of the Students for
a Democratic Society at Cornell
University voted 2 to 1 against
occupying the school's
administration building, then ran
about the campus, shouting
protests against the Reserve
Officers Training Corps.
A similar protest on the Ithaca,
N.Y. campus last December led to
disciplinary action against five
Negro students. This, in turn, led
to the occupation of Willard
Straight Hall April 19-20 by
Negro students who emerged
carrying guns.
Almost lost in the disorder at
CCNY was the original demand of
Negro and Puerto Rican students
who blockaded the South Campus
of the 20,000-student school on
April 22 and forced a two-week
shutdown.

A fire described as incendiary
swept through a building at City
College in New York (CCCNY)
Thursday and destroyed an
auditorium. The fire broke out
after an explosion in a closet, a
fire official said.
The fire broke out as City
College reopened in disarray and
as CCNY President Buell G.
Gallagher said "adventurers in
guerilla tactics" had taken over
from responsible black and Puerto
Rican students.
The blaze, described as
incendiary by Assistant Fire
Marshal Patrick Crowley,
destroyed the Arnow Auditorium
of the Goldmark Wing of the
Finley Student Center on the
strife-ravaged South Campus.
The blaze enveloped the
auditorium in the large, rambling
red brick building, which also
houses classrooms and meeting
rooms.
Exams Cancelled
Gallagher also announced that
the campus disruptions had forced
him to cancel the final
examination period and to alter
the usual grading system.
Heavy New York City police
details were on duty on the upper
Manhattan campus in the wake of
Wednesday's bloody clash
between Negro and white students
in which seven white students
suffered head wounds.
Ten Negroes, including four
girls, staged a hit-and-run
vandalism attack in one building
and disrupted classes. Some
classes were cancelled, fire alarms
rang, white students wearing red
armbands marched about the
campus and others ran through
buildings.
About 200 protesters faced j
about 200 counter
demonstrators—but the groups
were kept apart by police. Both
groups staged rallies.

Cornell
Elsewhere in the nation's
continuing campus turmoil, about
130 members of the Students for
a Democratic Society at Cornell
University voted 2 to 1 against
occupying the school's
administration building, then ran
about the campus, shouting
protests against the Reserve
Officers Training Corps.
A similar protest on the Ithaca,
N.Y. campus last December led to
disciplinary action against five
Negro students. This, in turn, led
to the occupation of Willard
Straight Hall April 19-20 by
Negro students who emerged
carrying guns.
