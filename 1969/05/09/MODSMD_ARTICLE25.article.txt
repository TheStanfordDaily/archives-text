# Housing Ballot
## 
### 
Ballots concerning the housing
of first-year foreign graduate
students in campus residences
have been distributed by the
ASSU office to Residence
Assistants and Tutors of all
dorms, excepting those which are
freshman, non-coed.
Each student in these dorms is
to receive one ballot, to be filled
out and returned to his Residence
Assistant today, at the latest.
The ballot is to determine how
many foreign students each dorm
should house, and, in co-ed
dorms, if this number should
include women.
The ballot is a follow-up of the
April 15-16 housing referendum,
on which students voted more
than 2-1 in favor of inviting
foreign graduate students to live
in campus living groups.
