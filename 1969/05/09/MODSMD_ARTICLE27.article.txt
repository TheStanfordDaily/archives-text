# More Battles Due
## Big Defense Cut 
### DONALD M. ROTHBERG Associated Press Writer 
WASHINGTON
[ AP ] —Secretary of Defense
Melvin R. Laird won the first
round of the defense budget fight
with a modest $1.1 billion in
cuts—but he faces further battles
with key congressmen and other
administration officials who
contend there's more fat that can
be trimmed.
Interviews with sources inside

and outside the Nixon
administration disclosed that
Laird successfully fended off
administration economizers who
wanted to cut about $3 billion
from next fiscal year's $79 billion
in planned Pentagon spending.
"It was no contest in the first
round," said one source familiar
with the budget maneuvering
inside the Republican
administration.
Key congressmen and others
are compiling lists of Pentagon
programs they think Laird
overlooked in making his cuts.
Most lists include:
—The Air Force's Manned
Orbiting Laboratory MOL. Laird

seeks $525 million for MOL.
— The Advanced Manned
Strategic Aircraft AMSA. Laird
wants $ 1 (JO million, an increase of
$23 million, to step up
development of this weapons
system.
—The Airborne warning and
control system AWACS. This $1
billion program is keyed to large
aircraft equipped with powerful
radar to patrol the periphery of
North America
—The Navy's Fast Deployment
