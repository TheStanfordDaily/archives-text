Saturday, May 10, will mark
the 100 th anniversary of the
"Golden Spike," commemorating
the completion of the first
transcontinental railroad in
America. At 9 a.m. in Tresidder
Large Lounge, the Chinese
Association will sponsor a forum
entitled "Asians in America, a
Historical perspective," to
consider the status of
Chinese-Americans, once brought
in as "coolie" labor to build these
railways.
Raymond Gong, of the Chinese
Student Organization, explained
some of the topics of concern. "In
those days," he said, "the position
of the Chinese immigrant was one
of laborer. They were welcomed
not only because they were seen
as a source of cheap labor for
railroad work, but they became

valued for their'willingness' to do
women's work: to wash the
clothes and cook the meals for the
pioneers."
Some of the questions to be
answered at the forum, said Gong,
are "Where are the 'Chinamen' in
American society today? Have
they so well blended into the
mainstream of American life that
they no longer merit the name of
Chinese-American, or are they still
a distinct group having special
problems and needs."
Professor Stanford Lyman of
Utah University will begin the
program, speaking on the history
of Chinese and Japanese in
America. A sociologist, he has
done extensive research in this
area. Professor Takagi, a
criminologist from U.C. Berkeley,
and Ling Chi Wang, a social
worker in San Francisco's
Chinatown, are also scheduled to
speak. They will deal with some
of the contemporary problems of
Asians in America, particularly
the Chinese.
At about 11 a.m. the forum
will break up into small discussion
groups.
