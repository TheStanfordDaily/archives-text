# Czech Students Reply to Support
## 
### 
Stanford received this response
from a Czech student to a letter
of support signed by over 100
Stanford students and sent to
Czech students in April, 19G8:
"Thanks and thanks for the
great help. Those -400 signatures
were incredible. We put them up
at our faculty on wall just near
the staircase where we have
usually our meetings. The success
was so great that your signatures
were then moved to the
philosophy faculty. Thanks once
again. You will soon get some
official document from our
students organization . . . Many
regards and thanks to your
friends . . ."
The student goes on to
describe the political situation in
Czechoslavakia since the fall of
Dubcek which came indirectly as
the result of celebrations for the
victory of the Czechs over the
Russians in hockey:
"You probably have heard
about the latest event in
Czechoslavakia. You probably
heard about our new student
strike, too. The future is not
optimistic at all now . . . The
democracy left this country. The

methods of the Kremlin are so
anti-human and so incredible that
we are always and always
surprised again, and then we lose.
In general people have become
more passive, you can also find
the traces of fear already. The
students are the most
progressive—but have too little
power over this dirty bureaucratic
system. You cannot imagine the
methods used against us. The mass
of people is too easily
manipulated. C'est la vie . . . Let
us hate those who broke into our
imaginations about
democracy ..."
As is always the case with
student movements, the Czech
students had to consider tactics,
but they had perhaps more to
take into consideration than do
many student demonstrators, for
in addition to the reality of police
with swinging clubs breaking up
student demonstrations, the
Czech students also had to
contend with the possibility of
tanks surrounding their cities,
secret police action, and armed
intervention. The students
neverthless decidecj to stage a
three-day sit-in


CON HOME WEEK-The second annual Con Home Week Carnival, featuring the world's largest double ferris wheel is
taking place through Sunday, May 11. Twelve thrilling rides and numerous games and concession stands will be open from
6 until 10 p.m. tonight and all day Saturday and Sunday. Proceeds will be donated to the Stanford Children's Convalescent
Home as part of the Con Home Week fund-raising drive.

were incredible. We put them up
at our faculty on wall just near
the staircase where we have
usually our meetings. The success
was so great that your signatures
were then moved to the
philosophy faculty. Thanks once
again. You will soon get some
official document from our
students organization . . . Many
regards and thanks to your
friends . . ."
The student goes on to
describe the political situation in
Czechoslavakia since the fall of
Dubcek which came indirectly as
the result of celebrations for the
victory of the Czechs over the
Russians in hockey:
"You probably have heard
about the latest event in
Czechoslavakia. You probably
heard about our new student
strike, too. The future is not
optimistic at all now . . . The
democracy left this country. The

methods of the Kremlin are so
anti-human and so incredible that
we are always and always
surprised again, and then we lose.
In general people have become
more passive, you can also find
the traces of fear already. The
students are the most
progressive—but have too little
power over this dirty bureaucratic
system. You cannot imagine the
methods used against us. The mass
of people is too easily
manipulated. C'est la vie . . . Let
us hate those who broke into our
imaginations about
democracy ..."
As is always the case with
student movements, the Czech
students had to consider tactics,
but they had perhaps more to
take into consideration than do
many student demonstrators, for
in addition to the reality of police
with swinging clubs breaking up
student demonstrations, the
Czech students also had to
contend with the possibility of
tanks surrounding their cities,
secret police action, and armed
intervention. The students
neverthless decidecj to stage a
three-day sit-in
