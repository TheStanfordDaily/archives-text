# Tribe Crew Set For Big Row
## 
### 
Stanford meets Cal in the Big
Row tomorrow at the Oakland
Estuary and for both crews this is
sufficient reason for the adrenalin
to flow. But this will be a special
race for the two teams for several
reasons.
For Stanford, a win tomorrow
will mean an unprecedented
fourth straight victory over Cal.
Seniors Gaynor Dawson, Steve
Crossland, and Team captain Bob
Thomas could become the first
Stanford oarsmen ever to win four
Cal shirts. It would also be coach
Will Condon's fourth win over Cal
in five tries.
For Cal, a win over Stanford is
the only way to salvage what even
coach Marty McNair must admit
to be a disappointing season. The
Bears won their first race against
USC and St. Mary's, but have not
won since. Two weeks ago they
were last in a four-boat race with
Long Beach, San Diego State, and
USC, and last week they lost to
Washington by 32 seconds over a
two-and-a-half mile course.
Another element affecting
Stanford is the desire for revenge.
In last year's i3ig Row, the varsity
victory (the Cal boat swamped in
very rough water with Stanford a

length ahead) averted a Cal sweep,
as the Bears won all three frosh
races the second and third varsity
races.
Stanford is coming off
back-to-back defeats at the hands
of UCLA and Irvine in Los
Angeles last weekend and would
also like to finish off the dual
meet season with a win. Coach
Condon feels that the losses were
"instructive" and that the Indians
will row much better against Cal.
The races will begin at 1 p.m.
tomorrow in the Oakland Estuary.

were last in a four-boat race with
Long Beach, San Diego State, and
USC, and last week they lost to
Washington by 32 seconds over a
two-and-a-half mile course.
Another element affecting
Stanford is the desire for revenge.
In last year's i3ig Row, the varsity
victory (the Cal boat swamped in
very rough water with Stanford a

length ahead) averted a Cal sweep,
as the Bears won all three frosh
races the second and third varsity
races.
Stanford is coming off
back-to-back defeats at the hands
of UCLA and Irvine in Los
Angeles last weekend and would
also like to finish off the dual
meet season with a win. Coach
Condon feels that the losses were
"instructive" and that the Indians
will row much better against Cal.
The races will begin at 1 p.m.
tomorrow in the Oakland Estuary.
Boatings for the races will be:
varsity — coxswain, Mike
Yoshimura; stroke, Bernie
Thurber; 7, Don Connolly; 6, Bob
Thomas; 5, Steve Crossland; 4,
Doug Livermore; 3, Gaynor
Dawson; 2, Wally Millar; bow,
Mike Huffington.
JV—coxswain, John Dudrey;
stroke, Don Steele; 7, Jon Clapp;
6, Dave Lee; 5, Rob Creighton; 4,
John Raines; 3, Bruce Howard; 2,
Dennis Morrow; bow, Pete Sapin.
Ist freshmen—coxswain, Bob
Slattery; stroke, Paul Preissler; 7,
Bob Belden; 6, Jim Topic; 5, Bob
Kasper; 4, Jim Troxell; 3, Larry
Granader; 2, Bill Dudley; box,
Pete Wagstaff.
2nd freshmen—coxswain, Nick
Miller; stroke, Harry Waters; 7,
Jerry Powell; 6, Steve Nyarady; 5,
Don Lachman; 4, Bob Estes; 3,
Ken Link; 2, Scott Thatcher; bow,
Dennis McCarthy.


QUACK!—Stroked by white-hatted good guy Uernhard Q. Thurber, the Stanford
crew leads UCLA past the 1000-meter mark in last week's race. The Tribe
eventually lost by a length of open water.
Stanford meets Cal in the Big
Row tomorrow at the Oakland
Estuary and for both crews this is
sufficient reason for the adrenalin
to flow. But this will be a special
race for the two teams for several
reasons.
For Stanford, a win tomorrow
will mean an unprecedented
fourth straight victory over Cal.
Seniors Gaynor Dawson, Steve
Crossland, and Team captain Bob
Thomas could become the first
Stanford oarsmen ever to win four
Cal shirts. It would also be coach
Will Condon's fourth win over Cal
in five tries.
For Cal, a win over Stanford is
the only way to salvage what even
coach Marty McNair must admit
to be a disappointing season. The
Bears won their first race against
USC and St. Mary's, but have not
won since. Two weeks ago they
were last in a four-boat race with
Long Beach, San Diego State, and
USC, and last week they lost to
Washington by 32 seconds over a
two-and-a-half mile course.
