## NLF Submits New Peace Plan 
### 
PARIS (AP)-The National
Liberation Front (NLF) Thursday
advanced a 10-point peace plan
containing a number of previously
rejected demands but also some new
elements which allied diplomats

promised tu study carefully.
The plan included a provision for an
interim coalition government in South
Vietnam and demands for the unilateral
withdrawal of allied troops, both turned
down previously by the United States
and South Vietnam. But the allies

carefully avoided rejecting the plan
outright.
Spokesmen for both delegations said
the plan would be examined carefully
before a position is taken.
The plan includes proposals in the
five point program of the NLF and the
four point plan of North Vietnam, but
it was offered as "the principles and
main content of an over-all solution"
and apparently would be negotiable.
16lh Session
It was presented by the Front's
representative, Tran Buu Keim, at the
16th session of the Vietnam peace talks.
It apparently was the product of the
weeks of high-level discussions that have
been going on in Hanoi, the North
Vietnamese capital.
North Vietnam's Le Due Tho,
strategist and Politburo member, was
present for the unveiling of the
revamped peace program and Xuan
Thuy, Hanoi's chief representative,
promptly gave the plan his full support.
U.S. Ambassador Henry Cabot Lodge
avoided a direct reply when newsmen
asked for his comment after the
meeting. He said the proposals dealt
with political matters and therefore
should be taken up by the Front and
the Saigon government.
New Elements
Although most of the provisions of
the plan had been advanced previously
in one form or another, one of the main
new elements was the packaging of the
various proposals in an integrated
whole. Another was the spelling out of
specific details.
The plan, for example, proposed that
a provisional coalition government
should be set up in South Vietnam as
soon as peace was established to arrange
for a general election. It envisaged
eventual rule of South Vietnam by
another coalition government, pending
reunification of North and South
Vietnam.
It called for the unilateral and
unconditional withdrawal of all allied
forces under international supervision to
be worked out by the parties.
