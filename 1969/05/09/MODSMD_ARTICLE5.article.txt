# President Asks Faculty To Honor Suspensions
## 
### 
(The following letter was released
last night—Ed.)
To All Members of tin' Faculty:
As most of you know, we already
have placed more than sixty students
who have been identified as participants
in the Encina Hall sit-in of May 1 on
immediate temporary suspension
pending a hearing by the Stanford
Judicial Council. As other students and
non-students are identified, they will be
treated in the same manner as those to
whom notices already have been sent.
The Stanford Judicial Council has
proven itself extraordinarily responsible
and just in dealing with the cases it has
heared in this, its first year. In my
judgment this group has made a major
contribution - one which deserves the
commendation of all of us—to the
concept of self-government at this
University. I know that the Council's
authority will be severely tested in these
latest cases, but I am convinced that
with your backing it will survive that
test.
I ask that you honor the suspension
ordei —which I promulgated at the
suggestion of the Judicial Council—by
not allowing suspended students in your
classes until they have had their
hearings. In this connection, it is
important to note that only seven of the
students who have received letters of
suspension have requested hearings.
This apparent reluctance to request
hearings suggests, as does the refusal to

give names at both sit-ins this spring, an
unwillingness to abide by judicial
procedures arrived at and endorsed by
the community generally. I sincerely
hope, therefore, that you will encourage
any suspended student you know to
bring his case before the Judicial
Council promptly.
There is another area in which your
cooperation and assistance are vital. To
assure fairness for all requires that we
positively identify as many as possible
of those who participated in the
occupation of Encina. Faculty members
who went through the building in the
early morning hours already have turned
in the names of persons they
recognized. Our colleagues who
shouldered that onerous duty warrant
our thanks and our support. II is in this
spirit that I ask your assistance by
coming to my office and identifying
from photographs taken during the
occupation of Encina any students
whom you know.
The real test, in the final balance, is
whether we can control our own affairs
in a University community that claims
dedication to the examined life. If we
cannot, if we must turn to outside
forces as we have so unhappily had to
do this spring, Stanford and the idea of
the University to which all of us are
dedicated will have suffered a serious
defeat.
Thank you.
