Stanford's biology faculty
denounced Thursday the continued use
of DDT and related pesticides.
"The evidence is overwhelming that

these persistent substances threaten the
ecological systems upon which human
life depends," said a statement signed
by 20 professors.
"Four recent studies also suggested
that chlorinated hydrocarbons which
are now being stored in the human
tissues may have direct harmful effects
on man himself."
Sixteen research fellows and 43
graduate students joined in signing the
statemi nt inspired by recent reports
thai , -sticides draining from interior
valley I arm lands were damaging the San
Francisco Bay and coastside ecology.
The statement deplored "recent
efforts by the agricultural chemical
industry and its trade publications to
discredit responsible scientists who are
calling attention to the dangers of
dispersal and accumulation of these
chemical compounds."
Donald Kennedy, biology chairman,
said the protest statement would be sent
to federal and state officials and the
conservation and professional
organizations.
