## 
### 
Tiie Senate of the Academic Council
voted 23-12 against any university-wide

requirement for undergraduates
Thursday.
Individual departments still can
require foreign language studies and
proficiency of students majoring in their

the lull Academic Council.
Curricular guidelines drafted by SES,
which have not yet been considered by
the Senate, suggest that "proficiency in
a language other than

that language, is strongly advised for
undergraduates."

29-9 to require two semester or three
quarter courses be taken in each of the
following three broad areas: I)

humanities and the fine arts; 2) social
sciences; 3) mathematics, natural
sciences, and technology.

student representatives earlier had

language requirement.

without dissent to require a one
semester or two quarter writing course
of all undergraduates. It endorsed a
similar requirement for historical
studies, which could be taught in several
departments besides history, by a 17-14
margin.
The Student Education Council has
opposed both these changes as
university-wide requirements, prefering
to place greater responsibility on
students for course selection.
