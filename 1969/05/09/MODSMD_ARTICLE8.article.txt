# Committee Asks Low-Cost Housing, Cites Stanford's 'Moral Obligation'
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Citing Stanford's "moral obligations
to be actively involved in solving
problems affecting its community," a
student-faculty-staff committee has
recommended that the University
establish on its land a low-rent housing
development of from 400 to 800 units,
open to the general public as well as the
Stanford community.
The 17-man committee estimated
that rents in such a project could be
reduced as much as 30 percent below
commercial rates through a combination
of Federal interest subsidy programs to
aid financing, and by the University's
donating the land on which the housing
would be built.
The committee, established in
November by Acting President Robert
J. Glaser, submitted its report to
President Kenneth S. Pitzer April 17.
The report was released to The Daily
yesterday.

The group's recommendations have
been forwarded to the Board of
Trustees, but due to the press of recent
events, the Board has been unable to
study the matter.
Stanford's Contributions
"It would be fatuous to deny that
the University has made a major
contribution to the development of the
mid-peninsula area," the committee
noted.
"It would be equally blind to deny
that that very development has, with all
of its benefits, produced problems that
threaten social disruption of very
serious proportion," they continued.
"Although Stanford shares the
responsibility to prevent this disruption
with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposed by the special
nature and interests of the University."
The committee also asked that a
program director be appointed as soon
as possible to develop preliminary plans.
Principal Conclusions
Several principal conclusions were
drawn by the group, headed by
Associate Dean of Research Robert H.
Mouton, Jr. The committee stated that:
There is a serious shortage of low
and middle rent housing in the
Stanford-Palo Alto area.
The University—through the
increasing number of students, faculty,
and staff, and through the development
of the industrial park and shopping
center—has helped prodice the increased
demand for and concommitant shortage
of low-rent housing.
Land is vital to such a project, and
Stanford owns the only large
uncommitted tracts in the area.
The problem can be alleviated only
if it is given high priority and the staff
and funds needed to develop a working
plan.
The controversy on low-cost housing
developed last fall when large numbers
of transfer students and new graduate
students were unable to find adequate
housing they could afford. At one
point, the American Federation of
Teachers local threatened to set up a
tent city on campus.
Through emergency measures, all
students found housing, but the basic
problem still existed. So Glaser
appointed the committee "to determine
the magnitude of the need lor low and
moderate cost housing in the Stanford
area and to make recommendations

giving specific attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land
being made available for such housing."
In the report, the group noted that
"the Stanford community, not unlike
most American universities, has always
been segregated along both social and
economic lines. Although this
segregation has hardly been deliberate,
it has had an important and generally
undesirable influence upon the thinking,
experience and attitudes of faculty,
staff, and students . . ."
No Housing for Employees
They noted there were 4 60 homes
for faculty and administrators on
campus, but no housing on University
land for employees with low or
moderate income. This shortage
conflicts with Stanford's minority
employment program.
In addition, "even when new
construction is taken into account, over
5,000 students must still find housing in
adjacent communities," the report
noted.
Besides this, the Industrial Park
employs over 18,500 persons, 40
percent of Palo Alto's total
employment. While one-third of those

who worked in Palo Alto in 1960 also
lived in the city, last year only 22
percent did so.
The local housing shortage has been
most severe for those with low incomes,
the committee found. It estimated the
unsatisfied demand for the Palo
Alto-Stanford area at 4,000 low rent
units, and said 70 percent of this "is
directly attributable to University
operations or the development of
Stanford Lands."
About 25 percent of Palo Alto
housing now is in apartments, and this
proportion will nearly double, as
high-priced units replace old, lower cost
homes.
"Stanford students are competing
very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower
cost housing that is available," the
report noted. "Students have been able
to respond to this shortage only by
overcrowding and moving further from
campus."
Estimated Rentals

rentals, at current market prices, would

Estimated Rentals
The committee estimated that
rentals, at current market prices, would
run from $175 to $275 a month
for the new units. If Stanford
donated the land, rentals could be
reduced by $14 a month. Trustees
might face legal restraints if these
units were open to persons not
associated with the University,
however.
But "truly significant rental
reductions can be achieved only
through federal interest subsidy
programs," the committee added.
This subsidy could run as high as
$95 per month for a person with
an income of $5,000 or less.
"The university is not in a
position, either morally or
physically, to provide a solution
for the entire problem, and must
encourage adjacent communities
to actively assume their share of
the responsiblity," the report
noted.
Capsule Communities
It also suggested three sites for
"capsule communities," involving
10 to 50 acres each; four areas for
residential communities, ranging
in size from 30 to 150 acres; and
three large, balanced
communities, on sites of 220 to
660 acres each.
The plan has since been put
into abeyance, and the question

of the Corporation Yard will be
studied by the City Council again
in the near future.
Louis Fourcroy, director of
planning and community
development for Palo Alto, was an
ex-officio member of the
committee. The low-cost housing
question "is an exceedingly
complex subject which does not
resolve itself very readily," he
noted.
"There is no question in my
mind that there is a need for such
housing," he added. "That is a
truth you can apply practically
any place you go. Is there a place
in the Bay area—or any part of the
United States —that does not have
a problem in providing housing
for people of lower incomes?

problem any worse here?

these things here, 1 cannot prove

run from $175 to $275 a month
for the new units. If Stanford
donated the land, rentals could be
reduced by $14 a month. Trustees
might face legal restraints if these
units were open to persons not
associated with the University,
however.
But "truly significant rental
reductions can be achieved only
through federal interest subsidy
programs," the committee added.
This subsidy could run as high as
$95 per month for a person with
an income of $5,000 or less.
"The university is not in a
position, either morally or
physically, to provide a solution
for the entire problem, and must
encourage adjacent communities
to actively assume their share of
the responsiblity," the report
noted.
Capsule Communities
It also suggested three sites for
"capsule communities," involving
10 to 50 acres each; four areas for
residential communities, ranging
in size from 30 to 150 acres; and
three large, balanced
communities, on sites of 220 to
660 acres each.
The plan has since been put
into abeyance, and the question

of the Corporation Yard will be
studied by the City Council again
in the near future.
Louis Fourcroy, director of
planning and community
development for Palo Alto, was an
ex-officio member of the
committee. The low-cost housing
question "is an exceedingly
complex subject which does not
resolve itself very readily," he
noted.
"There is no question in my
mind that there is a need for such
housing," he added. "That is a
truth you can apply practically
any place you go. Is there a place
in the Bay area—or any part of the
United States —that does not have
a problem in providing housing
for people of lower incomes?
"The question is, is the
problem any worse here?
"While I feel there is a need for
these things here, 1 cannot prove
it from the statistics that I have
seen," he concluded.
Citing Stanford's "moral obligations
to be actively involved in solving
problems affecting its community," a
student-faculty-staff committee has
recommended that the University
establish on its land a low-rent housing
development of from 400 to 800 units,
open to the general public as well as the
Stanford community.
The 17-man committee estimated
that rents in such a project could be
reduced as much as 30 percent below
commercial rates through a combination
of Federal interest subsidy programs to
aid financing, and by the University's
donating the land on which the housing
would be built.
The committee, established in
November by Acting President Robert
J. Glaser, submitted its report to
President Kenneth S. Pitzer April 17.
The report was released to The Daily
yesterday.

The group's recommendations have
been forwarded to the Board of
Trustees, but due to the press of recent
events, the Board has been unable to
study the matter.
Stanford's Contributions
"It would be fatuous to deny that
the University has made a major
contribution to the development of the
mid-peninsula area," the committee
noted.
"It would be equally blind to deny
that that very development has, with all
of its benefits, produced problems that
threaten social disruption of very
serious proportion," they continued.
"Although Stanford shares the
responsibility to prevent this disruption
with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposed by the special
nature and interests of the University."
The committee also asked that a
program director be appointed as soon
as possible to develop preliminary plans.
Principal Conclusions
Several principal conclusions were
drawn by the group, headed by
Associate Dean of Research Robert H.
Mouton, Jr. The committee stated that:
There is a serious shortage of low
and middle rent housing in the
Stanford-Palo Alto area.
The University—through the
increasing number of students, faculty,
and staff, and through the development
of the industrial park and shopping
center—has helped prodice the increased
demand for and concommitant shortage
of low-rent housing.
Land is vital to such a project, and
Stanford owns the only large
uncommitted tracts in the area.
The problem can be alleviated only
if it is given high priority and the staff
and funds needed to develop a working
plan.
The controversy on low-cost housing
developed last fall when large numbers
of transfer students and new graduate
students were unable to find adequate
housing they could afford. At one
point, the American Federation of
Teachers local threatened to set up a
tent city on campus.
Through emergency measures, all
students found housing, but the basic
problem still existed. So Glaser
appointed the committee "to determine
the magnitude of the need lor low and
moderate cost housing in the Stanford
area and to make recommendations

giving specific attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land
being made available for such housing."
In the report, the group noted that
"the Stanford community, not unlike
most American universities, has always
been segregated along both social and
economic lines. Although this
segregation has hardly been deliberate,
it has had an important and generally
undesirable influence upon the thinking,
experience and attitudes of faculty,
staff, and students . . ."
No Housing for Employees
They noted there were 4 60 homes
for faculty and administrators on
campus, but no housing on University
land for employees with low or
moderate income. This shortage
conflicts with Stanford's minority
employment program.
In addition, "even when new
construction is taken into account, over
5,000 students must still find housing in
adjacent communities," the report
noted.
Besides this, the Industrial Park
employs over 18,500 persons, 40
percent of Palo Alto's total
employment. While one-third of those

who worked in Palo Alto in 1960 also
lived in the city, last year only 22
percent did so.
The local housing shortage has been
most severe for those with low incomes,
the committee found. It estimated the
unsatisfied demand for the Palo
Alto-Stanford area at 4,000 low rent
units, and said 70 percent of this "is
directly attributable to University
operations or the development of
Stanford Lands."
About 25 percent of Palo Alto
housing now is in apartments, and this
proportion will nearly double, as
high-priced units replace old, lower cost
homes.
"Stanford students are competing
very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower
cost housing that is available," the
report noted. "Students have been able
to respond to this shortage only by
overcrowding and moving further from
campus."
Estimated Rentals
The committee estimated that
rentals, at current market prices, would
run from $175 to $275 a month
for the new units. If Stanford
donated the land, rentals could be
reduced by $14 a month. Trustees

area and to make recommendations

giving specific attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land
being made available for such housing."
In the report, the group noted that
"the Stanford community, not unlike
most American universities, has always
been segregated along both social and
economic lines. Although this
segregation has hardly been deliberate,
it has had an important and generally
undesirable influence upon the thinking,
experience and attitudes of faculty,
staff, and students . . ."
No Housing for Employees
They noted there were 4 60 homes
for faculty and administrators on
campus, but no housing on University
land for employees with low or
moderate income. This shortage
conflicts with Stanford's minority
employment program.
In addition, "even when new
construction is taken into account, over
5,000 students must still find housing in
adjacent communities," the report
noted.
Besides this, the Industrial Park
employs over 18,500 persons, 40
percent of Palo Alto's total
employment. While one-third of those

who worked in Palo Alto in 1960 also
lived in the city, last year only 22
percent did so.
The local housing shortage has been
most severe for those with low incomes,
the committee found. It estimated the
unsatisfied demand for the Palo
Alto-Stanford area at 4,000 low rent
units, and said 70 percent of this "is
directly attributable to University
operations or the development of
Stanford Lands."
About 25 percent of Palo Alto
housing now is in apartments, and this
proportion will nearly double, as
high-priced units replace old, lower cost
homes.
"Stanford students are competing
very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower
cost housing that is available," the
report noted. "Students have been able
to respond to this shortage only by
overcrowding and moving further from
campus."
Estimated Rentals
The committee estimated that
rentals, at current market prices, would
run from $175 to $275 a month
for the new units. If Stanford
donated the land, rentals could be
reduced by $14 a month. Trustees
might face legal restraints if these
units were open to persons not
associated with the University,
however.
But "truly significant rental
reductions can be achieved only
through federal interest subsidy
programs," the committee added.
This subsidy could run as high as
$95 per month for a person with
an income of $5,000 or less.
"The university is not in a
position, either morally or
physically, to provide a solution
for the entire problem, and must
encourage adjacent communities
to actively assume their share of
the responsiblity," the report
noted.
Capsule Communities
It also suggested three sites for
"capsule communities," involving
10 to 50 acres each; four areas for
residential communities, ranging
in size from 30 to 150 acres; and
three large, balanced
communities, on sites of 220 to
660 acres each.
The plan has since been put
into abeyance, and the question

of the Corporation Yard will be
studied by the City Council again
in the near future.
Louis Fourcroy, director of
planning and community
development for Palo Alto, was an
ex-officio member of the
committee. The low-cost housing
question "is an exceedingly
complex subject which does not
resolve itself very readily," he
noted.
"There is no question in my
mind that there is a need for such
housing," he added. "That is a
truth you can apply practically
any place you go. Is there a place
in the Bay area—or any part of the
United States —that does not have
a problem in providing housing
for people of lower incomes?
"The question is, is the
problem any worse here?
"While I feel there is a need for
these things here, 1 cannot prove
it from the statistics that I have
seen," he concluded.
Citing Stanford's "moral obligations
to be actively involved in solving
problems affecting its community," a
student-faculty-staff committee has
recommended that the University
establish on its land a low-rent housing
development of from 400 to 800 units,
open to the general public as well as the
Stanford community.
The 17-man committee estimated
that rents in such a project could be
reduced as much as 30 percent below
commercial rates through a combination
of Federal interest subsidy programs to
aid financing, and by the University's
donating the land on which the housing
would be built.
The committee, established in
November by Acting President Robert
J. Glaser, submitted its report to
President Kenneth S. Pitzer April 17.
The report was released to The Daily
yesterday.

The group's recommendations have
been forwarded to the Board of
Trustees, but due to the press of recent
events, the Board has been unable to
study the matter.
Stanford's Contributions
"It would be fatuous to deny that
the University has made a major
contribution to the development of the
mid-peninsula area," the committee
noted.
"It would be equally blind to deny
that that very development has, with all
of its benefits, produced problems that
threaten social disruption of very
serious proportion," they continued.
"Although Stanford shares the
responsibility to prevent this disruption
with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposed by the special
nature and interests of the University."
The committee also asked that a
program director be appointed as soon
as possible to develop preliminary plans.
Principal Conclusions
Several principal conclusions were
drawn by the group, headed by
Associate Dean of Research Robert H.
Mouton, Jr. The committee stated that:
There is a serious shortage of low
and middle rent housing in the
Stanford-Palo Alto area.
The University—through the
increasing number of students, faculty,
and staff, and through the development
of the industrial park and shopping
center—has helped prodice the increased
demand for and concommitant shortage
of low-rent housing.
Land is vital to such a project, and
Stanford owns the only large
uncommitted tracts in the area.
The problem can be alleviated only
if it is given high priority and the staff
and funds needed to develop a working
plan.
The controversy on low-cost housing
developed last fall when large numbers
of transfer students and new graduate
students were unable to find adequate
housing they could afford. At one
point, the American Federation of
Teachers local threatened to set up a
tent city on campus.
Through emergency measures, all
students found housing, but the basic
problem still existed. So Glaser
appointed the committee "to determine
the magnitude of the need lor low and
moderate cost housing in the Stanford
area and to make recommendations

giving specific attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land
being made available for such housing."
