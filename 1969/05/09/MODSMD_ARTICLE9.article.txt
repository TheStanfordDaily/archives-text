# Hearings Continue Over Suspensions
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has made no final decisions on the
hearings held Wednesday night of three
students suspended for their
participation in the occupation of
Encina Hall.
The three defendants, law student
Allan C, Alhadeff, junior Robert A.
Delfs in English, and senior Michael
Gilfin in political science, all pleaded
guilty to the charges.
A total of seven students suspended
because of the Encina incident have
requested SJC hearings so far. Four
hearings have already taken place. In the
first hearing, defenddant Ronald
Barliant, was cleated because he had
entered the building only briefly to
arrange legal aid for the occupants.
Two More Notices
Two additional students have been
sent suspension notices, making a
current total of 71 students suspended
until they appear before the SJC for
their participation in the sit-in.
The April 3rd Movement has been
making arrangements for the trial of
Wilbur Arroyo, a Stanford dorm, that
was mistakenly included in the original
list of defendants.
Despire this oversight, however,
Professor Jack Friedenthal, chairman of
the SJC, knows of no formal plans to
drop charges against the dorm. When
asked what actions will be taken against
Arroyo, Friedenthal jokingly answered,
"I guess he'll be suspended for quite
awhile."
The next meeting of the SJC is

scheduled for 3:30 this afternoon in
room 118 of the law school.
In connection with the judicial
actions which led to the suspension of
the students involved in the Encina
incident, the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) printed a
statement declaring, "We believe that
there should be no academic
punishment for political activity or for
political "crimes." But even those who
disagree with our views on this issue
should realize that the academic
punishment is being applied unjustly."
The statement went on to say that
"the current political situation has
several obvious judicial components:
1. Students are assumed guilty and
suspended by the President without
being charged or having had a hearing.
2. The Judicial Council has used
powers it never had to give the President
powers he does not and should not
have;
3. The administration now requests
students to follow the judicial charter
after it has abrogated the charter;
4. The President has sought
injunctions to increase the cost students
must pay to fight for their rights.

the 1968 judicial charter gives them the

the "residual authority of the

only the authority to act in a

HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN. At the
hearing against the AEL sit-in, it
was claimed that students refused
to cooperate with the Judicial
Council. But the charter clearly
protects students against
self-incrimination. The charge of
non-cooperation was really a
charge of refusing to incriminate
oneself. And since no defendants
were named, we must conclude
that there was no hearing.
The history of abuses of
students' rights at Stanford is as
old as the University itself. Each
time students' rights have been
violated, changes were brought
about by pressure. The 1964-65
excesses of the Deans office ended
when the Dean of Women was
forced to resign. In 1967-68 the
abortion called the Interim
Judicial Body saw its suspensions
against the anti-CIA
demonstrators overturned by a
vote of the entire faculty.

OUTSIDE the judicial system

for political suppression. We come'

the students through the Student

in this area will not be heeded."

punishment is being applied unjustly."
The statement went on to say that
"the current political situation has
several obvious judicial components:
1. Students are assumed guilty and
suspended by the President without
being charged or having had a hearing.
2. The Judicial Council has used
powers it never had to give the President
powers he does not and should not
have;
3. The administration now requests
students to follow the judicial charter
after it has abrogated the charter;
4. The President has sought
injunctions to increase the cost students
must pay to fight for their rights.
The Judicial Council and the
President have incorrectly claimed that
the 1968 judicial charter gives them the
support of the students and the faculty,
Moreoever the President is using power
that neither the charter nor any other
document ever gave him.
He and the Judicial Council refer to
the "residual authority of the
President" (section IV), but do so
incorrectly. The President has
only the authority to act in a
JUST AND EQUITABLE manner,
He must abide by due process,
reasonable time to prepare a
defense, the assumption of
innocence, and the need for
presentation of charges and
evidence-ALL OF WHICH ARE
GUARANTEED IN THE
CHARTER.
THE NEED FOR EXTRA
POWERS FOR THE PRESIDENT
HAS NOT BEEN SHOWN. At the
hearing against the AEL sit-in, it
was claimed that students refused
to cooperate with the Judicial
Council. But the charter clearly
protects students against
self-incrimination. The charge of
non-cooperation was really a
charge of refusing to incriminate
oneself. And since no defendants
were named, we must conclude
that there was no hearing.
The history of abuses of
students' rights at Stanford is as
old as the University itself. Each
time students' rights have been
violated, changes were brought
about by pressure. The 1964-65
excesses of the Deans office ended
when the Dean of Women was
forced to resign. In 1967-68 the
abortion called the Interim
Judicial Body saw its suspensions
against the anti-CIA
demonstrators overturned by a
vote of the entire faculty.
Again it is necessary to go
OUTSIDE the judicial system
because the system is being used
for political suppression. We come'
to this conclusion only after
trying to guarantee the rights of
the students through the Student
Conduct Legislative Council. We
are sorry to say that it is almost
certain that the SCLS's activities
in this area will not be heeded."
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
has made no final decisions on the
hearings held Wednesday night of three
students suspended for their
participation in the occupation of
Encina Hall.
The three defendants, law student
Allan C, Alhadeff, junior Robert A.
Delfs in English, and senior Michael
Gilfin in political science, all pleaded
guilty to the charges.
A total of seven students suspended
because of the Encina incident have
requested SJC hearings so far. Four
hearings have already taken place. In the
first hearing, defenddant Ronald
Barliant, was cleated because he had
entered the building only briefly to
arrange legal aid for the occupants.
Two More Notices
Two additional students have been
sent suspension notices, making a
current total of 71 students suspended
until they appear before the SJC for
their participation in the sit-in.
The April 3rd Movement has been
making arrangements for the trial of
Wilbur Arroyo, a Stanford dorm, that
was mistakenly included in the original
list of defendants.
Despire this oversight, however,
Professor Jack Friedenthal, chairman of
the SJC, knows of no formal plans to
drop charges against the dorm. When
asked what actions will be taken against
Arroyo, Friedenthal jokingly answered,
"I guess he'll be suspended for quite
awhile."
