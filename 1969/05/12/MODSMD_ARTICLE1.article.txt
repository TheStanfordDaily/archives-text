# A3M Boycott Starts Today, Gets ASSU Presidents' OK
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Rallies, discussions, guerilla theater, a
carnival and red armbands will mark the
first day of the April 3rd Movement's
two-day boycott of classes to press the
SRI demands.
The center of activity today will be a
large geodesic dome, erected by the
Movement in the middle of White Plaza.
Surrounding the dome will be 16 booths
and revolutionary games, and a
continuous schedule of radical
workships.
The boycott gained support from 27
faculty who announced plans to
postpone their Monday and Tuesday
classes (see details below ).
Yesterday the ASSU Council of
Presidents endorsed the first day of the
boycott and is circulating a
petition—with the support of five
faculty members—to demonstrate to the

Trustees "that the w hole Stanford
community is concerned about the
SRI-Stanford relationship," according
to Council member Pat Shea.
In their statement, the Council of
Presidents noted that "students voted
overwhelmingly in the SRI referendum
to bring J?RI into a closer relationship
with the University and to restrict
research in the areas of chemical and
biological warfare, counterinsurgency,
and applied war-related research.
"We consider this vote a mandate
from the student body," they
continued. "We will present these views
to the Trustees along with a plan to
restructure SRI over a period of years
into a research University within the
Stanford Community.
Symbol of Concern
"We urge that all those who support
these views not go to classes on Monday
as a symbol of concern. We further urge
students, faculty, and staff, as evidence
of their commitment, to sign the
petition that is being circulated.
"We reject the Encina sit-in and all
tactics of coercion and violence," they
concluded, "in basic agreement with the
student body which has twice voted to
condemn such tactics. The orientation
of SRI towards the amelioration of war,
disease, racism, pollution, and
overpopulation is a worthy and
attainable goal, and it can be achieved
without resorting to destructive force."
The 27 faculty members signed a
statement announcing plans to cancel
and reschedule their classes Monday and
Tuesday "to focus attention on the
critical issues of counterinsurgency and
the University's relationship to SRI
during the last days available before a
decision is taken by the Board of
Trustees . . .
Transcend Group Interest
"We hope through our action to
make it clear to the Board of Trustees
that these issues transcend any single
group interest and affect us all as
members of a larger community of
concern."
