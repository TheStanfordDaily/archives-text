# Boycott
## 
### 
Stanford students should not go to
classes today, nor should instructors be
holding classes.
Many people at Stanford want to end
war research. Strong support for the April
3 Movement's demands has been expressed
in polls and votes. But these polls and votes
were, in a sense, a deferential way of giving
advice. Both the Stanford Trustees and
Stanford students know that marking a
ballot does not constitute the same kind of
commitment on the issues that directly
involving one's life in the efforts to stop
war research does.
Anyone who wants to halt University
complicity in America's Southeast Asian
war can and should support this boycott.
Those people who were perturbed, for
whatever reason, by the Encina sit-in have
an excellent chance to look at the April 3
group again. They and everyone else can
examine the directions the Movement is
taking. Participation in workshops and
discussion groups will tell a person more
about the A3M than reading mimeographed
hand-outs ever can.
Here is a chance for the 1400 people
who signed the AEL sit-in complicity
statement to reassert their dedication to
the demands of A3M. Here is a chance for
faculty members to demonstrate their
support for the concerns of A3M. About
thirty teachers have already pledged not to

conduct classes. Faculty action is
imperative. Recently many Western (iv
instructors stood up tor their traditional
right to allow anyone they wished to audit
their courses. In the same spirit, faculty
who do not like having their University
corrupted by war research should act to
prevent continuation of that research.
The presence of any counterinsurgency
studies on the Stanford campus and at SKI
is something which should never be
tolerated. The demands of the April 3
Movement speak to these issues. The
Trustees' meeting Tuesday must focus on
war-related and counterinsurgency
research. The students deserve a statement
from the Trustees on this research.
The issues raised in the A3M demands
are matters a broadly-based group of
students feel strongly about. The Trustees
may not realize just how determined
students are to stop war research. The
students who are not in class today and
tomorrow will be tangible evidence of the
sort that the Trustees can comprehend.
Students and faculty who support the
class boycott are making a moral
commitment to the cause of peace by
trying to stop the use of resources for the
purposes of war. The boycott is something
which the whole community can join in
supporting.
