## SCLC Head Blasts Members 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing to protest what
appears to me to be unethical and
dishonest conduct on the part of
the five student members of the
SCLC. Recently, without SCLC
authority, and without
the knowledge of the SCLC, they
distributed a dangerous statement,
which was erroneously published
in the Daily on Friday, May 9, as
an SCLC document (that article is
retracted by the Daily). This
statement, signed by Espen, Such,
Braunstein, Kane and von
Schlegell, is full of inept argument
and misrepresentation. It is not
the document itself 1 wish to
attack, for it is merely absurd; it is
the action of these five students in
distributing it that I protest here.
They signed this document
with their names, and also as
"Student Members of the SCLC."
In so doing they imposed a
factionalism on the SCLC that
renders it inoperative.
Furthermore, they distorted the
facts: they implied that the SCLC
had taken certain actions it had
never taken. They used their
position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon
this community with false
authority at a time when the
community is in crisis. The
apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering.
To set the public record
straight I declare here that the
SCLC has passed no legislation
since it came into existence.
Therefore, all rules that were in
effect when the SCLC was created
are still in effect. At no time did
the SJC have any reason to
observe or be guided by any
action of the SCLC since we have
passed no binding legislation. On
several occasions we have put
proposals for possible legislation
before the community, but I
declare again we have passed
none.
The jurisdiction of the SJC and
the powers of the President are
matters beyond the jurisdiction of
the SCLC. We could not and did
not take any position concerning
them. By our failure to pass any
new legislation we confirm all
present rules including the rule
governing campus disorders dated
October 7, 1968, which is
properly recognized as being
currently in effect.
The unethical conduct of the
five members of the SCLC named
aboved has destroyed the basis of
that trust and respect required by
a responsible and effective
legislative body—a trust and
respect I had hoped had been
established among members of the
SCLC. To protect this community
in the future I have taken the

necessary steps to initiate
consideration of an amendment to
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter that would provide for
impeachment of members of the
SCLC.

I have informed my Western
Civ. classes that I could not
withhold their grades. The tactic
was neither fair nor appropriate.
However I want to re-affirm
strongly my support for the first
paragraph of the letter which I
signed with my colleagues on May
7, and will work with them and
others to face the issues raise so
effectively by the April Third

Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerned by the depth of my
disagreement with those Western
Civ instructors who consider their
Daily letter of May 8 to have been
a good tactic, I would like to
make the following arguments.
As University instructors we,
more than any other segment of
society, are or ought to be
primarily concerned with the
disinterested pursuit of truth, the
critical analysis of concepts, and
the definition of terms with as
much intellectual rigor as possible.
However, much considerations of
expediency may compel
politicians or those in other walks
of life to depart from these goals,
an academician can do so only at
the cost of fatally compromising
his basic function.
I find the statement of May 8
departs from these goals in the
following respects.
1) "Academic freedom" is a
concept which simply does not
apply to the right (or lack of
right) of a student to attend
classes at a university. Applying it
to such a ssituation can result
only in diluting its true meaning,
with the danger of ultimately
rendering it meaningless.
2) That an instructor has an
unchallengable right to decide
who may or may not audit his
calsses is an extremely
questionable assumption, in
support of which no evidence has
been presented.
3) The threat to withhold
grades was untruthful and
dishonest because many of the
signers did not intend to carry out
the threat even if the necessary
situation arose.

Sloganeering and sloppy
thinking are temptations to be
fought, not allies to be enlisted.
The precise and honest use of
words is crucially important, for
they are the only vehicles we have
for rational thought and
discussion. If we are unwilling
tomake a criticism of
administration policy which is
capable of withstanding the same
critical analysis which we demand
of our students and of our own
scholarly work, then we should
refrain from making any criticism
at all.

It is indeed a nasty word: 2nd
Lt. John Hayes accuses me of
FRAUD in describing my military
experience, which was a basis for
my criticisms of ROTC (Letters,
May 9). He says I cannot have
received a three-year commission
out of NROTC, and speculates
needlessly as to whether I "may
or may not have served in the
Naval Service."
I have checked with my former
Commanding Officer and he says
YES, I did serve. About four-year
commissions for NROTC
scholarship students, and whether
"it has been this way since the
program began," Mr. Hayes may

now check with his former
Commanding Officer at Stanford,
Colonel Thomas, who has verified
for me that the obligation was
changed from three to four years
in 1961, many years after the
program started. I wish Mr. Hayes
had tried to discuss some of the
points of my letter.

I think it is important to
realize that while it is likely that
those who boycott classes will be
presumed to agree with the use of
that tactic, it is just as likely that
those who attend classes Monday
and Tuesday will be presumed to
disagree with A3M's goals.
It is imperative, I believe, that
every person who supports a
redirection of SRl's research
pursuits but disapproves of the
boycott must make his views on
SRI known to the Board of
Trustees. Write a letter to the
Board NOW and mail it, or take it
personally to the Board of
Trustees, c/o President Pitzer's
office. To fail to do this is to
force the Board to equate tactics

Apparently the 19 instructors
of Western Civ are not quite clear
as to what "academic freedom"
involves. In order to satisfy their
own conscience in regard to what
they consider to be academic
freedom, they are willing to
disregard the "academic freedom"
of 1300 students to receive their
grades. I am at present taking
Western Civ due to my having
transfered into Stanford. In june,
I am going to apply to medical
school. I am not too happy at the
thought of having my transcript
held up so that a group may show
their discontent with the actions
of the administrators.
Obviously, the declaration of
the Western Civ instructors is little
more than a gesture and will
probably remain as such. I would
just suggest that the instructors
become more aware of the
conplexity of the concept of
academic freedom, and perhaps
even become more understanding
of the administrator's position.

I am writing to protest what
appears to me to be unethical and
dishonest conduct on the part of
the five student members of the
SCLC. Recently, without SCLC
authority, and without
the knowledge of the SCLC, they
distributed a dangerous statement,
which was erroneously published
in the Daily on Friday, May 9, as
an SCLC document (that article is

the document itself 1 wish to

They signed this document
with their names, and also as
"Student Members of the SCLC."
In so doing they imposed a
factionalism on the SCLC that

Furthermore, they distorted the
facts: they implied that the SCLC

never taken. They used their
position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon
this community with false
authority at a time when the
community is in crisis. The
apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering.
To set the public record
straight I declare here that the
SCLC has passed no legislation
since it came into existence.
Therefore, all rules that were in
effect when the SCLC was created
are still in effect. At no time did
the SJC have any reason to
observe or be guided by any
action of the SCLC since we have
passed no binding legislation. On
several occasions we have put
proposals for possible legislation
before the community, but I
declare again we have passed
none.
The jurisdiction of the SJC and
the powers of the President are
matters beyond the jurisdiction of
the SCLC. We could not and did
not take any position concerning
them. By our failure to pass any
new legislation we confirm all
present rules including the rule
governing campus disorders dated
October 7, 1968, which is
properly recognized as being
currently in effect.
The unethical conduct of the

Concerned by the depth of my
disagreement with those Western
Civ instructors who consider their
Daily letter of May 8 to have been
a good tactic, I would like to
make the following arguments.
As University instructors we,
more than any other segment of
society, are or ought to be
primarily concerned with the
disinterested pursuit of truth, the
critical analysis of concepts, and
the definition of terms with as
much intellectual rigor as possible.
However, much considerations of
expediency may compel
politicians or those in other walks
of life to depart from these goals,
an academician can do so only at
the cost of fatally compromising
his basic function.
I find the statement of May 8
departs from these goals in the
following respects.
1) "Academic freedom" is a
concept which simply does not
apply to the right (or lack of
right) of a student to attend
classes at a university. Applying it
to such a ssituation can result
only in diluting its true meaning,
with the danger of ultimately
rendering it meaningless.
2) That an instructor has an
unchallengable right to decide
who may or may not audit his
calsses is an extremely
questionable assumption, in
support of which no evidence has
been presented.
3) The threat to withhold
grades was untruthful and
dishonest because many of the
signers did not intend to carry out
the threat even if the necessary
situation arose.

Sloganeering and sloppy
thinking are temptations to be
fought, not allies to be enlisted.
The precise and honest use of
words is crucially important, for
they are the only vehicles we have
for rational thought and
discussion. If we are unwilling
tomake a criticism of
administration policy which is
capable of withstanding the same
critical analysis which we demand
of our students and of our own
scholarly work, then we should
refrain from making any criticism
at all.

I am writing to protest what
appears to me to be unethical and
dishonest conduct on the part of
the five student members of the
SCLC. Recently, without SCLC
authority, and without
the knowledge of the SCLC, they
distributed a dangerous statement,
which was erroneously published
in the Daily on Friday, May 9, as
an SCLC document (that article is
retracted by the Daily). This
statement, signed by Espen, Such,
Braunstein, Kane and von
Schlegell, is full of inept argument
and misrepresentation. It is not
the document itself 1 wish to
attack, for it is merely absurd; it is
the action of these five students in
distributing it that I protest here.
They signed this document
with their names, and also as
"Student Members of the SCLC."
In so doing they imposed a
factionalism on the SCLC that
renders it inoperative.
Furthermore, they distorted the
facts: they implied that the SCLC
had taken certain actions it had
never taken. They used their
position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon
this community with false
authority at a time when the
community is in crisis. The
apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering.
To set the public record
straight I declare here that the
SCLC has passed no legislation
since it came into existence.
Therefore, all rules that were in
effect when the SCLC was created
are still in effect. At no time did
the SJC have any reason to
observe or be guided by any
action of the SCLC since we have
passed no binding legislation. On
several occasions we have put
proposals for possible legislation
before the community, but I
declare again we have passed
none.
The jurisdiction of the SJC and
the powers of the President are
matters beyond the jurisdiction of
the SCLC. We could not and did
not take any position concerning
them. By our failure to pass any
new legislation we confirm all
present rules including the rule
governing campus disorders dated
October 7, 1968, which is
properly recognized as being
currently in effect.
The unethical conduct of the
five members of the SCLC named
aboved has destroyed the basis of
that trust and respect required by
a responsible and effective
legislative body—a trust and
respect I had hoped had been
established among members of the
SCLC. To protect this community

necessary steps to initiate

impeachment of members of the

straight I declare here that the
SCLC has passed no legislation
since it came into existence.
Therefore, all rules that were in
effect when the SCLC was created
are still in effect. At no time did
the SJC have any reason to
observe or be guided by any
action of the SCLC since we have
passed no binding legislation. On
several occasions we have put
proposals for possible legislation
before the community, but I
declare again we have passed
none.
The jurisdiction of the SJC and
the powers of the President are
matters beyond the jurisdiction of
the SCLC. We could not and did
not take any position concerning
them. By our failure to pass any
new legislation we confirm all
present rules including the rule
governing campus disorders dated
October 7, 1968, which is
properly recognized as being
currently in effect.
The unethical conduct of the
five members of the SCLC named
aboved has destroyed the basis of
that trust and respect required by
a responsible and effective
legislative body—a trust and
respect I had hoped had been
established among members of the
SCLC. To protect this community
in the future I have taken the

necessary steps to initiate
consideration of an amendment to
the Legislative and Judicial
Charter that would provide for
impeachment of members of the

Editor, THE DAILY:
Concerned by the depth of my
disagreement with those Western
Civ instructors who consider their
Daily letter of May 8 to have been
a good tactic, I would like to
make the following arguments.
As University instructors we,
more than any other segment of
society, are or ought to be
primarily concerned with the
disinterested pursuit of truth, the
critical analysis of concepts, and
the definition of terms with as
much intellectual rigor as possible.
However, much considerations of
expediency may compel
politicians or those in other walks
of life to depart from these goals,
an academician can do so only at
the cost of fatally compromising
his basic function.
I find the statement of May 8
departs from these goals in the
following respects.
1) "Academic freedom" is a
concept which simply does not
apply to the right (or lack of
right) of a student to attend
classes at a university. Applying it
to such a ssituation can result
only in diluting its true meaning,
with the danger of ultimately
rendering it meaningless.
2) That an instructor has an
unchallengable right to decide
who may or may not audit his
calsses is an extremely
questionable assumption, in
support of which no evidence has
been presented.
3) The threat to withhold
grades was untruthful and
dishonest because many of the
signers did not intend to carry out
the threat even if the necessary
situation arose.

Sloganeering and sloppy
thinking are temptations to be
fought, not allies to be enlisted.
The precise and honest use of
words is crucially important, for
they are the only vehicles we have
for rational thought and
discussion. If we are unwilling
tomake a criticism of
administration policy which is
capable of withstanding the same
critical analysis which we demand
of our students and of our own
scholarly work, then we should
refrain from making any criticism
at all.

Lt. John Hayes accuses me of
FRAUD in describing my military
experience, which was a basis for
my criticisms of ROTC (Letters,

received a three-year commission
out of NROTC, and speculates
needlessly as to whether I "may

I have checked with my former
Commanding Officer and he says
YES, I did serve. About four-year
commissions for NROTC
scholarship students, and whether
"it has been this way since the

now check with his former
Commanding Officer at Stanford,
Colonel Thomas, who has verified
for me that the obligation was
changed from three to four years

I think it is important to
realize that while it is likely that
those who boycott classes will be
presumed to agree with the use of
that tactic, it is just as likely that
those who attend classes Monday
and Tuesday will be presumed to
disagree with A3M's goals.
It is imperative, I believe, that
every person who supports a
redirection of SRl's research
pursuits but disapproves of the
boycott must make his views on
SRI known to the Board of
Trustees. Write a letter to the

Apparently the 19 instructors
of Western Civ are not quite clear
as to what "academic freedom"
involves. In order to satisfy their
own conscience in regard to what
they consider to be academic
freedom, they are willing to
disregard the "academic freedom"
of 1300 students to receive their
grades. I am at present taking
Western Civ due to my having
transfered into Stanford. In june,
I am going to apply to medical
school. I am not too happy at the
thought of having my transcript
held up so that a group may show
their discontent with the actions
of the administrators.
Obviously, the declaration of
the Western Civ instructors is little
more than a gesture and will
probably remain as such. I would
just suggest that the instructors
become more aware of the
conplexity of the concept of
academic freedom, and perhaps
even become more understanding
of the administrator's position.

Editor, THE DAILY:
I am writing to protest what
appears to me to be unethical and
dishonest conduct on the part of
the five student members of the
SCLC. Recently, without SCLC
authority, and without
the knowledge of the SCLC, they
distributed a dangerous statement,
which was erroneously published
in the Daily on Friday, May 9, as
an SCLC document (that article is
retracted by the Daily). This
statement, signed by Espen, Such,
Braunstein, Kane and von
Schlegell, is full of inept argument
and misrepresentation. It is not
the document itself 1 wish to
attack, for it is merely absurd; it is
the action of these five students in
distributing it that I protest here.
They signed this document
with their names, and also as
"Student Members of the SCLC."
In so doing they imposed a
factionalism on the SCLC that
renders it inoperative.
Furthermore, they distorted the
facts: they implied that the SCLC
had taken certain actions it had
never taken. They used their
position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon
this community with false
authority at a time when the
community is in crisis. The
apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering.
To set the public record
straight I declare here that the
SCLC has passed no legislation
since it came into existence.
Therefore, all rules that were in
effect when the SCLC was created
