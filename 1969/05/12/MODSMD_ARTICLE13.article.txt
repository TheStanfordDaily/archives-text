## A
						Proposal For The Board 
### Roulette Smith 
Editor's Note: The following column
by Roulette Smith is the text of a
proposal lie will submit to the Stanford
Hoard of Trustees tomorrow. Smith is
a member of the University Advisory
Committee.
S u nun a ry
The Board of Trustees of
Stanford University is being asked
to decide what future
relationships should exist between
the University and SRI. They are
also being asked to decide
whether SRI should cease work
concerning chemical and
biological warfare and
counter-insurgency. The decisions
reached will clearly affect the
long-range plans and directions of
both the institutions. The
dilemma, despite the many
unfortunate characteristics,
presents a unique opportunity for
creating institutionalized
mechanisms by which the present
conflict may be resolved.
Furthermore, other conflicts
might be averted.
This proposal includes specific
recommendations by which it is
thought that the immediate crises
may be terminated. It also tries to
anticipate several other
problems—some of which are of
current concern. These problems
include:
a) university financing;
b) the need for institutional
autonomy and integrity;
c) student admissions and
recruitment;
d) the structure (but not the
function) of the Board of
Trustees;
e) the areas of directed
research in which students may
participate;
112) the administration of
autonomous institutions;
g) mechanisms for asserting
institutional morals;
h) professional autonomy
within SRI;
i) The relative lack in
understanding of how to effect
smooth institutional changes.
The proposal is concluded with
a plan of action that the Board
could implement beginning with
their next (May 13, 1969)
meeting. Too, there is a brief
discussion of the implications of
the various proposals and the plan
of action.
Proposals
1. The board of Trustees
should decide not to sever their
fiduciary responsibilities for SRI.
2. There should be a resolution
recommending the establishment
of a joint committee on research
policy guidelines. That committee

should consist of elected
representatives of each of the
institutions (SRI and SU). There
should be equal representation
within this committee.
3. The functions of the joint
committee (JCRPG) shall be as
follows:
a) serve as an organization
of ombudsmen for
recommending guidelines on
research policy.
b) submit their
recommendations to the
individual institutions for
ratification.
c) exercise no policing or
review authority.
4) There should be an
autonomous Senate of
Professionals within SRI. That
group shall have powers that
parallel those of the Academic
Senate at SU. They, in fact, would
ratify research policy guidelines.
5. The Board of Trustees shall
eliminate the SRI Board of
Directors. This does not imply
that the administration of SRI
should be changed. In fact, the
intention is to maintain essentially
the same organizational structure
with the exception of the explicit
proposals stated herein. See no. 9.
The directors of SRI would
become a committee of the Bord
of Trustees.
6 . There shall be an
administrative and
institutionalized arrangement
whereby graduate students from
the university (SU) would be able
to pursue "project research" (as
opposed to discipline-oriented
research) at SRI. That
"administrative arrangement"
shall take into account:
a) the dissemination of the
form of the arrangement in
all bulletins, catalogs, and
professional employment
brochures;
b) students admitted to the
university and accepted for
some "project research"
program shall receive regular
(university) student benefits
including tuition grants, tax
advantages (e.g., tax
exemptions), library
privileges, health benefits,
etc.;
c) the desirability to
minimize the "red tape"
concerning academic
credits, research supervision,
and, the comprehensive,
language and oral
examinations.
7. Over the long-term future
there shall be tenured
appointments granted to qualified
professionals of SRI.
8. The Board of Trustees
should not restrain SRI (or
representatives of that institution)
from pursuing an endowment.
9. The Board of Trustees
should be restructured to permit:
a) diversity among the
appointed membership;
b) a reasonable number of
elected representatives from
the obvious institutions
controlled by the Board;
c) few, if any, conflicts in
interests concerning place of
employment, personal
benefits, and trusteeships
held (by the appointed
members) at other academic
institutions comparable to
Stanford University.
10. A large planning and
support grant should be sought
from either the foundations or the
government (or both). This grant
should probably be expected to
continue throughout some brief
(say, s'year) transitional period. It
shall be used to provide for the
direction of the transition, the
analysis and planning of that
transition, and the remuneration
of fees to consultants.
D iscussion
It is clearly the intention of the
proposals to reaffirm the
institutional autonomy and
integrity between SU and SRI.
These are achieved with little
organization change—in terms of
stated objectives and personnel.
Many of the proposals require a
formalization of already informal
relationships between the two
institutions. It should be added
that the relationships perceived
are nearly parallel to those
between the university and some
of the on-campus institutes. In
particular, the Institute for
Mathematical Studies in the Social
Sciences represents a very close
approximation of the desired
institutional relationship. Thus
there is a precedent for the
justification of some of the
proposals.
It should be emphasized that
the suggestions and proposals
contained herein are subject to
continual refinement. (This is
precisely the reason for pursuing
planning grants.) As a matter of
fact, several statements (Sands
and Linvill) have similar objectives
to those offered in this paper.
A. Point-by-Point Discussion
The following paragraphs are
intended to provide, very briefly,
the background and justification
for the proposals. (The numbers

correspond to the numbered
proposals.)
1. In order for the Board to
effectively shape and direct SRI,
they should not sever their
relationship with that institution.
Simply stated, they will have
considerably more legal flexibility
if they do not cut the ties.
Another reason for maintaining
control of SRI is that under the
proposed scheme it is an asset
with great potential for improving
the financial position of the
university. Severance, it could be
argued, may lead to a slow-down
in growth of the present financial
position of the university.
2 & 3. The purpose of the joint
committee on research policy
guidelines is thought to be an
answer to the lack of a mechanism
for asserting the institutional
morals. This committee may be
thought of as group of elected
ombudsmen responsible for
formulating research policy
guidelines. Those guidelines would
be submitted to the appropriate
Senate (The Academic Senate at
SU and/or the Senate of
Professionals at SRI) for
ratification.
The JCRPG would not have
policying or review
responsibilities. An honor system
is assumed although the respective
Senates should have powers of
censure and enforcement.
Quite clearly then, control of
SRI is a moot point. SRI would
have institutional integrity as a
"sister" institution. Nonetheless,
the important step would be
taken to see that a mechanism
exists for asserting "between" and
"within" institutional morals.
4. The establishment of a
Senate of Professionals at SRI is
long overdue. That, organisation
has operated in a manner almost
as decentralized as the university.
Too, the senior professionals, to
this author's understanding, have
personal autonomy and discretion
similar to their university
counterparts. Thus it seems only
reasonable to confirm that respect
now informally held by formally
permitting them to govern
themselves.
5. The elimination of the SRI
Board of Directors is related to
the need for restructuring the
Stanford Board of Trustees. The
restructured Board would
presumably have a committee of
its members assuming the
responsibility now held by the
SRI Board of Directors. That
committee would include all of
the elected representatives from
SRI who serve on the Board of
Trustees.
It should be clear that the
elimination of the SRI Board of
Directors should not affect the
present administration of SRI. In
fact, with the exception of the
formalization of arrangements
between the two institutions and
the proposed Senate of
Professionals, SRI should not
require organizational changes.
6. The presence of graduate
students at SRI, it is argued,
provides for greater opportunities
for interdisciplinary studies at the
graduate level. (The SES
Committee reportsdid not discuss
these needs too clearly.) These
opportunities are particularly
important in terms of project
research requiring facilities and
contacts with the "real world."
SRI is structurally well suited to
provide for these needs.
Graduate students should also
contribute to the quality of
research at SRI by assisting the
professionals while maintaing
some empathy with the actual
research being conducted. It could
be projected that these
contributions might lead to
expanded project support and
perhaps an increased prestige for
both institutions. In the case of
the latter, the prestige may well
have a bearing on the size and
number of donations to the
endowment and facilities of both
institutions.
It is not expected that the
students would be any cost to the
university or SRI. They would be
sponsored by the project research.
It might be added that this
arrangement makes it possible for
an increased enrollment of
minority and poverty-classed
college graduates.
7 & 8. The granting of tenured
appointments cannot be expected
before there is an SRI
endowment. Hence, it is
unreasonable to expect any before
3 to 5 years. Also, the
requirements for tenure must be
stringent because of the relatively
larger number of professionals at
SRI. Nevertheless, the tenure
appointments will attract
professionals who would be
expected to establish research
leadership for industry thorugh
their discretionary efforts.
9. The restructuring of the
Board of Trustees is essential for
the ultimate success of the
proposed institutional
relationships. It should be
emphasized that the new structure
for the Board does not imply that
there are to be new functions for
the Board. The functions of the
Jard are subjects that should be '

attacked separately. The proposed
structure would, however, provide
the necessary diversity in
viewpoints for reasoned
judgments.
As it is presently conceived,
the Board would consist of
students, faculty, professionals
from SRI, the administrations
(presidents) of the two
institutions, and a number of
trustees-at-large.
The trustees-at-large would
serve for, say, 10-year
non-renewable terms. One or two
of these members would be
selected yearly. They should have
diverse backgrounds and interests.
Too, they should adhere to a
clearly formulated policy
concerning conflicts in interest.
Other trustees would serve for
4-year non-renewable terms. The
presidents shall always be
represented.
There are two types of
conflicts in interest that are
inexcusable and unacceptable. To
wit, no firm or other incorporated
body shall have more than one of
its employees of (directors)
trustees included among the
Stanford University
trustees-at-large. The clear
justification for this is that the
Board does have a clear
money-making responsibility.
Hence, there are enough firms and
alumni of a desired stature to not
have to confine the selections to
one or a few firms. The second
unacceptable conflict in interest
concerns members of the Board
who are trustees at other major
universities. It must be recognized
that a trustee cannot solicit funds
with equal energy for more than
one academic institution. A loose
analogy would be to liken these
persons to the poly gam ist.
The Board should operate as a
committee-oriented body. Hence,
one committee would be expected
to fill the role of the presently
constituted SRI Board of
Directors.
10. The last proposal was made
to provide for the smooth
transition required to get to the
proposed state of affairs. It should
be recognized that consultant,
research, and administrative
expenses would be incurred by
the implementation of this set of
proposals.
There is a clear and immediate
justification for pursuing the
necessary funds from the
foundations and the government.
There are, for instance, clear
advantages gained by knowing
how to effect institutional change
with minimal conflict and
disruptions. It is a very real
problem to construct a
"self-correcting" model of
institutional change.
B. Flan of Action
Recognizing that the Board
should proceed cautiously but
deliberately in some direction, it
is suggested that the following
steps be taken at the next Board
meeting:
1. The Board decide that it
cannot severe relations with SRI
in view of information presently
available.
2. The Board should, hence,
not consider rescinding the
"moratorium" on chemical
warfare and biological warfare.
3. The Board commend the
actions of the administrations,
students, and employees of the
two institutions for their
expressed concerns and restraint.
4. The Board encourage the
SRI administration to organize its
professional employees.
5. The Board should
recommend the establishment of
the joint committee on research
policy guidelines as formulated
above.
6. The Board authorize its
president to examine the
feasibility of implementing this
proposal. The president shall in
turn ask for evidence from an
outside source to support the
arguments presented.
7. A resolution should be
passed expressing the Board's
intention to withhold further
action (except for studies of
alternative proposals) until fall
quarter.
