## A 						Look At Pitzer's Summary Suspensions 
### Bill Cozard Richard Such 
Some research into the power
of the President of Stanford and
the history of the University has
led the authors of this piece to the
conclusion that President Pitzer
may well have failed to follow the
rules of the game in his summary
suspension of certain members of
the April Third Movement.
We must begin with a brief
look at some of the early history
of Stanford. In the beginning
there was David Starr Jordan.
Jordan had a rather tyrannical
view of student discipline.
In the matter of establishing
and enforcing standards of
conduct, Dr, Jordan, and the
faculty with him, had little use for
formal rules.
From O.L. Elliott, Stanford
University: The First Twenty-Five
Years 408 (1937)
He advocated the rigorous
elimination from the University of
all unworthy students-not only
those found guilty of specific acts
of immorality or of dishonesty,
but any whose personal influence
was oobjectionable. Those who
were "dissipated, profligate,
intemperate, tricky or foul of
tongue" should be removed,

though no specific act of wrong
doing has been proved against
them.
From E. Burns, David Starr
Jordan: Prophet of Freedom 18
(1953) Jordan's view of discipline,
coupled with certain events at
Encina Hall, led to something of a
crisis. In the early days, Encina
served as a dorm for mem, and
from the beginning the life style
of these students was
characterized by roughhousing
and vandalism. These problems
became more serious as the years
passed.
Another angle on Encina
happenings was disclosed by the
Daily Palo Alto (January 21,
1 896): "Certain students in
Encina Hall are becoming entirely
too reckless in their acts of
vandalism. Besides the thievery in
the rooms . . .there has been a
great amount of general
lawlessness in the way of smashing
furniture and damaging property.
# * *
The destruction of property,
finally became so flagran* that the
city office sent down as night
watchman a stalwart ex-policeman

with plenty of courage, and little
discretion, who speedily made
himself obnoxious to the entire
llall. His habit of flourishing a
revolver, of making himself at
home in the Club Room, and of
entering student rooms without
knocking was bitterly resented,
and his presence added something
to the turbulance of the Hall. He
did come to know pretty well
what was going on, and in his
reports to the Business Office was
generally able to give the names of
chief participants in the numerous
riots that occurred.
From O.L. Elliott, op. cit. p.
423.
This lack of discipline, lack of
rules, and the use of summary
disciplinary actions troubled Mrs.
Stanford and the Board of
Trustees. On October 3, 1902
Mrs. Stanford added the following
amendment to the Founding
Grant:
It shall be the duty of the
Board of Trustees to make general
laws providing for the government
of the University, and to provide
for just and equitable rules of
discipline.
The purpose of this clause was

explained by Judge Crothers, a
close friend and legal advisor of
Mrs. Stanford, in a letter to
Thomas W. Stanford (Sept. 21
1905):
With special reference to the
informal removal of students
without charges assigned or
hearing granted-sometimes by a
single member of a Faculty
Com niittee-Mrs. Stanford added
the [above] clause to the
University trusts, primarily to
assure to the students the rights
which tradition and the
elementary principles of justice
accord them as of right . . .
. . .As this clause follows the
clause as to the powers of the
President, the latter is subject to
its provisions.
From 1 Berg (ed.), A Legal
History of the Titles, Trusts, &
Organization of the Leland
Stanford Junior University (1963)
Although the historical context
and the interpretation of Judge
Crothers are not absolutely
conclusive, under a strict
interpretation it would appear tha
the main purpose of the
amendment was to phohibit the
President, or anyone else acting

for the University, from taking
disciplinary action against a
student unless and until the
student has been accused of a
violation of a "general law" or a
"just and equitable rule of
discipline" and given a formal
hearing before a judicial body
intependent of the President.
Furthermore, since this
amendment to the Founding
Grant is part of the fundamental
"law" of Stanford University, no
authority of a contrary nature can
be given to the President by the
Board of Trustees, by the S.J.C.
or by anyone else. If this
interpretation is correct, then the
President of Stanford has no
so-called "emergency power"
summarily to suspend students,
and the recent action of President
Pitzer against members of the
April Third Movement in invalid.
Even if the President did have
emergency power, it is clear in the
light of the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968 that such
power can only be exercised
under extraordinary
circumstances, that is, where it
would be vain to invoke the
ordinary processes of the S.J.C.
Put otherwise, the President
cannot, under the Charter,
enforce University regulations by
by summary suspensions unless
the S.J.C. has failed, or is bound
to fail, to enforce them by notice
and adjudication. The mere fact
that the S.J.C. failed to obtain the

names of the A.E.L. protestors
does not show that it could not
enforce University regulations
against the Encina protestorsâ€”the
success of the administration in
obtaining the names of the latter
shows the contrary.
Much sweat and tears (but
somehow no blood) was spent last
year by many dedicated students,
professors and administrators
alike to establish a judicial system
which would "assure to the
students the rights which tradition
and the elementary principles of
justice accord them as of right."
The new President is unjustified in
using that system in every but a
judicial way. He is not playing the
game.
