## Why Boycott? Why Today? 
### Michael Sweeney 
Today is eight years after U.S.
troops entered Vietnam, four
years since U.S. planes started the
bombing, and two months since
U.S. deaths passed the total of the
Korean War.
And today is seven years since
SRI recommended heavier U.S.
aid to the Diem regime, three
years since SRI established a
counter insurgency operations
office in Thailand, and eight
months since SRI renewed two
million dollars worth of Southeast
Asian war research contracts.
Today is the day before the
meeting of the Stanford Board of
Trustees. They will decide
whether SRI will continue to be a
research warehouse for the
international adventures of U.S.
government and corporations, or
whether SRI will take a new
direction.
The Trustees will make their
decision in a closed room with
advisers of their choosing. The
opinions of you and me, who feel
involved in the aaffairs of this
University, will not count.

Strong and established interests
will pressure the Trustees to sell
SRI to ensure that destructive and
exploitive research will continue.
Under Secretary of Defense David
Packard has announced that
"independence" for SRI is the
solution. The Stanford
administration, led by Pitzer and
Lyman, will ask for no action at
tomorrow's meeting (to avoid
sparking a new sit-in), but a quiet
decision to sell SRI in a few
months, so SRI won't be around
to spark the sit-ins next year.
Clever? The Stanford faculty,
represented at the meeting by
Schiff, Clebsch and Dornbusch,
can be expected to push for sale
of SRI to win new revenue for the
faculty - controlled University
budgets.
How can we influence these
men? How can we argue for values
of simply humanity against the
values of special interest and
material gain?
Those questions are the theme
of the boycott of all classes today
and tomorrow, organized by the

April 3rd Movement. They are not
new questions, and we shall
certainly encounter them often in
the future.
A few hundred students sought
one desperate answer last month
by seizing Encina Hall. Contrary
to the backlash propaganda
against the sit-in, the logic of the
action was clear. The
power-holders in the
Un iversity - Trustees,
administration, faculty—were
refusing to act in a responsible
fashion on SRI. The most direct
way to exert a countervailing
pressure on them was to halt the
business functioning of the
University, which stands high
among their many areas of speical
interest.
The remarkable effectiveness
of the two sit-ins last month is
shown by the grim response of
Pitzer. He seems to be in
agreement with what a panicked
Harvard President Hathan M.
Pusey told Congress: "We have
got to get rid of a small group of
revolutionaries and then work
with the other students."
Pitzer has already used
arbitrary suspensions and a court
injunction of questionable legality
to force the April 3rd Movement
to submit to the Stanford Judicial
Council. And the SJC, as rumor
has it, is considering one-year
suspensions or expulsions as
punishments. As many as 100
dedicated members of the
Movement are threatened with
this severe academic penalty for
their political action.
Perhaps those 100 students,
who will be "gotten rid of" as
Pusey suggests, have done as much
as they can to further the April
3rd demands on SRI research.
Perhaps only the thousands of
students who have sympathized,
but not yet acted, can make a

demonstration of concern so
strong that the Trustees cannot
ignore it.
The boycott is the way to
show that concern. Missing two
days of classes will be a
troublesome sacrifice, and that is
precisely why the boycott has
meaning. By boycotting, we show
the Trustees that we put the
interests of peace above private
gain. This University must do the
same.
