# Why Not Me?

### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Please accept my objections to
the article on Mary Hansen. What
a girl radical, non-student is doing
on the front page of the Daily is
beyond me. Further, the story, as
most of your writings was
sophomoric and a poor attempt at
a semibiography.
At any rate the article should
have been done on me not her
since:
1) I'm better looking and I
take baths,
2) I don't use 1930's
expressions such as warmonger
and imperialism . . .rather my
expressions tend to be both
modern and relevant,
3) I am not naive and
unquestioning,
4) I don't interfer with other's
rights in the name of democracy,
5)1 am not 22 and therefore I
don't think I have all the answers.
Sincerely,
Ed Abbott GSB
