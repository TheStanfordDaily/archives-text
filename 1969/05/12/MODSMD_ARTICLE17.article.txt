# Text Of Report On Low Cost Housing At Stanford
## 
### 
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<

under $15,000 1* 1%

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88
1961-62 109 53 + 56
1962-63 96 103 - 7
1963-64 119 90 + 29
1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %
under $15,000 1* 1%

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88
1961-62 109 53 + 56
1962-63 96 103 - 7
1963-64 119 90 + 29
1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County

University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.

The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of

cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses

4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %
under $15,000 1* 1%
$15,000-19,999 12 10%
$20,000-24,999 17 14%

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88
1961-62 109 53 + 56
1962-63 96 103 - 7
1963-64 119 90 + 29
1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88

1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %
under $15,000 1* 1%
$15,000-19,999 12 10%
$20,000-24,999 17 14%
$25,000-29,999 21 17%
$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154

TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88

1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

percent below the commercial market.

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:

The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing

Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445

Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154

1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %
under $15,000 1* 1%
$15,000-19,999 12 10%
$20,000-24,999 17 14%

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88
1961-62 109 53 + 56
1962-63 96 103 - 7
1963-64 119 90 + 29
1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

percent below the commercial market.

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154

1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %
under $15,000 1* 1%
$15,000-19,999 12 10%
$20,000-24,999 17 14%
$25,000-29,999 21 17%
$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:

Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to

concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88

1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:

The price distribution of the units in the

1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple

The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:

Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net

TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:
. n<
number %
under $15,000 1* 1%
$15,000-19,999 12 10%
$20,000-24,999 17 14%

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120
Industrial Park 944 326
Shopping Center 52 18
Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154
1960-61 124 36 + 88
1961-62 109 53 + 56
1962-63 96 103 - 7
1963-64 119 90 + 29
1964-65 64 47 + 17
1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
Dear President Pitzer:
On November 6, 1968 Acting President Glaser
appointed a Low Cost Housing Committee
because of growing concern over the lack of
adequate low and moderate cost housing locally,
and asked that I serve as its chairman. Dr. Glaser
also pointed out that by the time our Committee
had concluded its work you would have taken
office and would be the recipient of any
document we might produce. It is with pleasure
that I forward to you herewith the Committee's
report.
You will note that the first three pages are a
brief recapitulation of the Committee's
assignment, reasons for the University's concern
and a summary of the Committee's
recommendations. The balance of the attached
material includes additional relevant data and
develops in some detail the analyses which
underlie the committee's conclusions. I will be
happy to make available the full reports of the
subcommittees and other supporting materials at
your request.
It is the Committee's hope that you will
concur in our recommendations and will seek
affirmative action on them by the Board of
Trustees at the earliest practicable time.
Sincerely,
Robert H. Moulton, Jr.
BACKGROUND & SUMMARY
On November 6, 1968, Acting President
Glaser appointed a Low Cost Housing
Committee* which was asked to determine "the
magnitude of the need for low and moderate cost
housing" in the Stanford Area and to make
recommendations giving "special attention to the
possibility of certain Stanford land being made
available for such housing."
The Committee has had seven general sessions
of approximately two hours each. Four
subcommittees (Policy, Program, Finance and
Research) were also formed and all have met
numerous times at the request of their respective
chairmen. As a consequence of its studies and
deliberations the full Committee reached the
following principal conclusions:
1. There is a serious shortage of low and
moderate rent housing in the Stanford/Palo Alto
area.
2. The University has helped to produce the
area's shortage of low rent housing both because
of the housing needs of its students, faculty, and
staff, and because its land development programs
(primarily the industrial park and the shopping
center) have significantly increased demand for
local housing.
3. Land is a key element in any solution to
the low-rent housing problem, and Stanford, as
the owner of the only large uncommitted parcels
of land in the immediate area, is thus
conspicuously able to be of help in attacking the
problem.
4. The current housing shortage can be
alleviated only if a program to develop low and
moderate rent housing is given a high priority
and the staff and funds necessary to carry out
the detailed planning for such a program are
made promptly available.
5. Stanford has a moral obligation to be
actively involved in solving problems affecting its
community. Many universities, including
Harvard, MIT, Columbia, Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell
and Pennsylvania, have recognized such an
obligation and are undertaking programs
appropriate to their particular resources and
locale. Harvard's Committee on The University
and The City states that "no institution of
[Harvard's] size and . . . purpose can be neutral
about its environment ... If a false sense of
neutrality were ever possible it is no longer so in
an era of intense community and neighborhood
self awareness." Harvard has also taken specific
action in the matter. Together with MIT they
have established the Cambridge Corporation and
each institution has pledged $250,000 to the
corporation whose purpose is ". . . to assist in the
economic, physical and social improvement of
the City of Cambridge." Low and moderate
income housing has been given a special priority
by the Corporation.
In defining its future relationship with the
community the Executive Board of the
University of Pennsylvania Board of Trustees
recently made the following statement: "The
Trustees declare a policy of accountability
and responsibility that accepts the concerns
and aspirations of the surrounding
communities as [the University's] own
concerns and aspirations . . ." Our Committee
believes Stanford can and should attack the
local housing shortage on a scale which is
significant and not in conflict with the basic
educational objectives of the University.
As a direct result of the five conclusions
listed above the Committee recommends that:
A. Stanford establish on its land a low rent
housing development of significant size
relative to the problem;
B. The general public as well as those
associated with Stanford be eligible to live in
the development;
C. The Stanford land required for the project
be leased at no cost, and
D. A program director be appointed as early
as possible and be given sufficient authority,
staff and funds to accomplish the preliminary
planning of a significant development.
(Estimated cost of such planning is $20,000.)
The following points are also offered in
further definition and support of the
Committee's recommendations:
1. The Committee is satisfied that there are
several sites on the campus which would.be
suitable for low-rent housing
developments.
2. 1968 Housing Act programs (Sections 235
and 236) could make financing for such a
development available for as low as 1
percent annual interest.
3. When it speaks of "development" the
Committee is aware that a number of
different programs are possible. The
following three distinct kinds of progiams
are considered particularly suitable for
location on Stanford lands:
a. Short-term development
(1) Capsule Community Projects (e.g.,
the Hacienda on Escondido Road) see
page 17.
(2) Residential Community Project (e.g.,
Escondido Village,
b. Long-term development
Balanced Community Project (e.g., "New
Town" complexes)
4. In speaking of a program of "significant
size" the Committee means one which
would equal between 10 and 20 percent of
the current shortage. The Committee's
data shows a need for approximately 4 000
low-rent units in the area; thus, the
program recommended is for between 400
and 800 units.
5. The Committee believes that if financing as
available at 1 percent per annum and land
is available at no cost the development's

percent below the commercial market.

should take every opportunity to
introduce experimental and innovative
concepts into the design of any
development it may undertake.
INTRODUCTION
A consideration of the housing problen.
requires a determination of the nature ar J
severity of local housing needs, an evaluation of
the adverse effects of these needs upon the
University and its community, and the
determination of Stanford's responsibility
concerning these needs. Other prominent
universities have found it necessary to reevaluate
their policies on housing for their lower income
students, staff, and even nonaffiliated members
of their communities. In partial response to
housing needs in Cambridge, Massachusetts,
Harvard and MIT are co-sponsoring the
Cambridge Corporation. The production of low
and moderate income housing is among the
prime objectives of this non-profit corporation.
Columbia Teachers College is sponsoring a major
housing project to provide realistically priced
units for students, staff and also non-university
persons. Wesleyan, Yale, Cornell and the
University of Pennsylvania are also becoming
deeply involved in community concerns.
Through a series of programs, Stanford has
already established a policy of involvement in
non-academic affairs which directly affect the
University and the community. These are
manifest in our existing campus housing
programs, cultural presentations and other
special programs designed for both minorities
and economically disadvantaged.
UNIVERSITY ,'v ES PON? i BIL IT lES
No discussion of Stanford and low-cost
housing is complete without a consideration of
the responsibilities an institution of higher
learning has to its own community and to the
larger society. These responsibilities are primarily
economic and social and &re both directly and
indirectly related to the nature of the university.
Direct Responsibilities
These characterize the institution's
relationship to its students, staff, faculty, and
administration. To this end, the University has
provided housing for the majority of its single
undergraduate students, a small fraction of
graduate and married students, and has made
land and superior financing available to satisfy
faculty and senicr staff housing needs. University
involvement, however, has not been entirely
proportional to the housing needs of these
various groups. For example, over 600 students
were on the waiting lists for single and married
student housing as of September 1968. That
these lists have remained large through the
academic year indicates that many students still
have not found adequate housing. Furthermore,
there is no homing on Stanford lands for
University employees with low or moderate
incomes.
These imbalances are not deliberate and may
be understood by looking at the University's
recent past. Large numbers of married students
were a post-war phenomenon that few planners
were prepared for. The burgeoning graduate
student population has made housing predictions
hazardous and often short-sighted. Development
of Stanford lands for faculty and senior staff
housing was a sensible means of realizing
important benefits to the University and the
larger community. The plan eased the demand
for upper-income housing in the area, provided
faculty with convenient and attractive housing,
and was an important factor in persuading
scholars to leave other universities to join the
growing Stanford faculty.
All of this has meant that those members of
the Stanford community least likely to afford
quality housing have to obtain housing away
from the campus without benefit of land and
financing subsidies. The University needs to
reconsider its existing policy on housing so that
more e ;uitv among members of the community
can be established.
Indirect R espc >nsibilities
These characterize those institutional
responsibilities with respect to midpeninsula
residents, industries, and municipal governments.
Stanford has made an important contribution to
the economic development of this area; it has
created jobs, encouraged the development of its
lands in such a way as to provide more jobs, and
has contributed to making Palo Alto a most
desirable place to live. While adjacent
communities have not always planned adequately
for their housing needs, the extent to which
Stanford has created jobs wihtout commensurate
concern for housing has also contributed to the
tight a.id expensive housing situation in the
surrounding area. The demand for housing by
University, industrial park and ether Stanford
land employees has made finding housing
particularly difficult for minority and low
income groups which are less able to compete for
existing housing. As the area's major 10-.-dov ler
and employer Stanford has to consider its
housing responsibilities to those persons both
directly and indirectly influenced by Stanford's
contribution to the midpeninsuia's rapid growth.
Area Leaders!tip
Stanford University has acquired, partly by
design and partly by default, a major leadership
role in the midpeninsula. Nearly all of the
adjacent communities look to Stanford for
direction, if not for solution, of many
socio-economic problems arising in the area. The
current concern about low-cost housing is no
exception. The Palo Alto Cily Council, lor
example, has deferred making a decision
concerning use of the old Corporation Yard for
low to moderate income housing pending the
recommendations of the Stanford Low Cost
Housing Committee. Ir. addition, ti e Council has
requested formally that tiie Committee consider
the use of land in th« Stanford Industrial Park
for such housing. Stanford can and probably
should respond to this and comparable situations
in two fashions. T' e University has the social and
economic motivation coupled with the physical
means to make significant steps towards
alleviating the existing need for 1 iw and
moderate income rental housing. The Ui iversity
is not in a position, either morally or physically,
to provide a solution for the entire proble n, end
must encourage the adjacent communites to
actively assume their share of the responsibility.
By initiating an active program to construct low
rental housing, Stanford will in a sense be serving
notice on the adjacent communities that i.. is
now their turn to act. Stanford should, however,
design its program and direct its efforts so as o
be exemplary »o these communities.
HOUSING IN THE
STANFORD/PALO ALTO AREA
The demand for housing in the midpensinsula
has been exceeding the supply for several years.
Before the rapid development of the electronics
and aerospace industries around the nucleus of
Stanford's extensive, high quality scientific
research, Palo Alto was strictly a well-to-do
residential suburb of San Francisco sprinkled
with open fields and agricultural acreage. The
initiation of Stanford's land-development
program in the 1950's began a period of marked
change in the nature of Palo Alto. On one side of

the campus nearly 450 acres were designated in
1953 for a model industrial park which would
cater especially to electronics, aerospace, and
other scientific research firms. On the other side
of the campus a regional shoppir.g center, the
largest on the midpeninsula, was begun. Palo
Alto found itself swiftly becoming an important
employment and commercial center in the Bay
Area.
During the decade, 1950 to 1960, Palo Alto's
large population growth rate of 7.9 percent
annually resulted in the near depletion ol open
land available for the construction of new
housing. Since 1960 the population has grown
less than 1 percent per year while the number of
jobs in Palo Alto has increased at an annual rate
of 11 percent.
With rising housing costs and shrinking
vacancy rates, Alto employees have had to
look outsiih the city for housing. In 1960
thirty-thvej percent of all Palo Alto workers lived
in the oity. In 1968, after eight more years of
increasit.k tightness in the housing market, only
22 percent of the epiployees lived in Palo Alto.
Although Palo Alto oiesently employs over
47,000 people, it hat; only 14,000 single family
homes and some 6000 apartments, for a total of
only 20,00 C residential i'nits.
The Stanford Industrial Park alone has had a
significant effect on Palo Alto. It now employs
over 18,500 persons, which is 40 percent of Palo
Alto's total employment, and will employ over
24,000 after lull development. More firms have
been drawn to Palo Alto by the existence of the
industrial park companies. Retail establishments,
hotels, and motels have been built to meet the
demands of the new businesses. The resulting rise
in employment in Palo Alto over the last 15
years has markedly chsi the profile of
demand for lood housing. While previously
demand had come largely from well-to-do
families who made their living outside Palo Alto,
housing demand soon became distributed over all
income ranges, representing the increasing
employment vvithin Palo Alto. Nevertheless,
when the Industrial Park was begun and
employment projections were made, there was
little concern for the predictable increase in
demand for lower income housing. As the
University's Vice-President for Business Affairs
points out, both Stanford and Palo Alto wanted
to keep the quality of housing in the area as high
?.s possible.
This demand for housing has been most severe
with regard to lower priced units. Statistics on
new homes in Palo Alto compiled by California
Lands Investment Company show that no low or
moderately priced homes are being built in Palo
Alto and that the supoly of even high cost houses
is decreeing:
Year (4th quarter only)
1965 1966 1967 1968
Houses in Construction 28 1 1 0
Houses Complete but Vacant 3 24 9 0
Recorded Vacant Lots 28 10 18 9
Total Inventory 59 35 18 9
The price distribution of the units in the
above table is not available for 1965, but for
1966 through 1968 none of the units were priced
at less than $35,000 (vacant lots were valued for
this study as if appropriate housing was on
them).
A further indication of the high priced nature
of the Palo Alto housing market is given by the
homes sold in Palo Alto through the Multiple
Listings Service during the fourth quarter of
1968:

$30,000-39,999 40 33%
$40,000 & over 29 24%
Total 120
*had only 1 bdrm.
The high cost of new housing and the shortage
of older low priced housing have forced a large
proportion of lower and even moderate income
Palo Alto/Stanford employees to seek housing
well outside the area. A recent study (March,
1969) of the place of residence of full-time
Stanford employees reveals that the lower the
income bracket, the larger the proportion within
that bracket that live outside the area bounded
by Mountain View and Redwood City:
Residential Distribution by Income
Annual earnings % living beyond R.C.-M.V. Area
under 6,000 34.5%
6,000 to 8,000 38.2%
8,000 to 10,000 30.2%
10,000 to 12,000 26.3%
13,000 to 15,000 18.9%
15,000 to 20,000 12.3%
Over 20,000 10.4%
Since employees in the Stanford Shopping
Center, the Industrial Park and Palo Alto proper
should have comparable relations between
income and place of residence the 34.5 percent
of heads of households earning less than $6000
may be used to estimate the local housing
shortage experienced by these groups. The total
number of off campus student households may
be obtained by assuming that 2.5 single off
campus students constitute one household and
1.3 married off campus students constitute one
household. Considering that probably 60 percent
of these would prefer housing closer to, if not
on, campus an estimate of the low rent housing
shortage experienced by students may be
obtained. The derivation of the total
Stanford/Palo Alto need for additional low cost
housing is summarized in the following table:
Households earning under $6000 in Palo Alto/Stanford
Area, 1968-69
Total No. in inadequately
located housing
Stanford
Off campus students 3282 1969
Staff-Regular 1291 445
—Affiliated 349 120

Total 5918 2878
Palo Alto (excluding
Industrial Park and
Shopping Center) 3189 1101
TOTAL Stanford
& Palo Alto 9107 3979
Thus there is an unsatisfied demand for about
4000 low income units in the Palo Alto/Stanford
area. Some 2900 of this shortage or 70 percent is
directly attributable to University operations or
the development of Stanford lands.
With the continuation of present trends, Palo
Alto will become an even more exclusive upper
middle class community with little, if any, social
and economic diversification or balance.
Population will grow at a low rate and housing
demands will continue to be satisfied only in the
upper price brackets. With the virtual depletion
of Palo Alto flatland available for single family
dwellings new construction has been increasingly
in apartments. From 1960 to 1966 the
proportion of multiple dwelling units to total
dwelling units increased from 10.0 percent to
17.7 percent. Palo Alto housing currently
consists of about 25 percent apartments and is
expected eventually to have 47 percent
apartments and 53 percent single family units.
Most of these high-priced apartments will replace
old, lower cost homes and thus will reduce
further the amount of housing for low income
persons. The trend towards the actual reduction

of single family residential units in Palo Alto is
clearly illustrated by a comparison of the
demolitions and construction of such units for
the period 1957 to 1967:
Year No. of units No. of units Net
(4-1 to 3-31) Constructed Demolished Gain/Loss
1957-58 266 64 +202
1958-59 278 44 +234
1959-60 211 57 +154

1965-66 42 46 - 4
1966-67 36 50 - 14
TOTAL 1,345 590 +755
Two new large housing developments on
leased Stanford land, the Oak Creek and Willow
Creek apartments, are quite representative of
current trends in the construction of residential
units. Both of these, which will be open in the
near future, will consist of multiple dwelling
units designed for higher incomes. Oak Creek
studio apartments, for instance, will start at
about $175 per month. Such large-scale housing
developments on local flatlands will probably be
limited largely to whatever land Stanford makes
available. Any future construction in the
foothills will consist mainly of expensive estate
homes and townhouses. Few, if any, houses will
be built for sale under $35,000. In general, Palo
Alto will see a continuation of present
trends—rising land and housing values and
disappearing moderate, as well as low, income
housing. This housing tightness has and will
continue to spread to neighboring communities.
EFFECTS OF LOCAL HOUSING
SHORTAGES UPON STANFORD
Student Housing
Existing residential units on the Stanford
campus provide housing for approximately 70
percent of the single undergraduate students and
about 600 graduate students but existing married
student housing is adequate for only 30 percent
of the married graduate student body. Escondido
IV A and IV B will accomodate approximately
600 students. Even when this new construction is
taken into account over 5000 students must still
find housing in the adjacent communities. In the
past married and also unmarried graduate
students have been able to find suitable quarters
in Palo Alto (College Terrace, downtown area),
East Palo Alto, Menlo Park and other nearby
communities. As recently as 1964 the apartment
occupancy rate in the Palo Alto-Mountain View
area was some 85 percent, and units at a variety
of rates were readily available. This is no longer
the case. Housing crises of increasing severity
have occurred each autumn. As of February
1969, the Palo Alto vacancy rate was less than
three percent (a survey by San Jose State College
School of Business, indicated a vacancy rate of
less than one percent). In contrast the FHA
considers a vacancy rate of 6 to 7 percent is
required to provide for normal turnovers. As a
direct result of this apartment shortage, the
rental rate for many tenants has been increasing
sharply. In addition, Stanford students are
competing very actively with minority and low
income groups for the limited lower cost housing
that is available. Students have been able to
respond to this shortage only by overcrowding
and moving further from campus. In East Palo
Alto, for example, the open competition for
housing (often coupled with a landlord's
preference for white tenants) has caused some
degree of consternation in the Black community,
and a growing animosity towards Stanford
students and the University itself.
Faculty Housing
For the majority of the Stanford faculty,
housing poses no serious problem. The numerous
faculty homes on the campus provide for some
460 faculty and administrators, with desirable
housing at both lower land costs and mortgage
rates than are available in the adjacent
communities. Those faculty members choosing
to live off campus generally receive incomes
enabling them to compete successfully in the
local real estate markets. The main burden for
housing is upon newly arriving junior faculty
members and those senior faculty members
transferring to Stanford or spending a short term
here. The housing needs of junior faculty have
been serious enough to prompt the Junior
Faculty Forum to establish a housing committee
headed by Prof. Henry Levin. This committee
conducted a survey of junior faculty (including
instructors) in January 1969, to define more
clearly these housing problems. This survey
revealed that high housing costs and lack of
capital for down payments were the most
common barriers to their obtaining adequate
housing.
Staff Housing
The housing frustrations experienced by the
Stanford staff are similar, and not unrelated, to
those experienced by students and faculty. The
range of housing needs by the staff probably
exceeds that of the students and faculty
combined. Higher salaried staff are certainly able
to afford homes in the desirable sections of
adjacent communities, and some are given the
opportunity to live on campus. At the other
extreme the lowest paid staff cannot afford to
live in Palo Alto, and large portions of Menlo
Park and Mountain View. These persons must
compete with students and other low income
groups for housing in East Palo Alto, or must
commute to Stanford from Redwood City,
Sunnyvale and even San Jose, San Francisco and
East Bay communities.
The paucity of local low cost housing is
especially pertinent with respect to Stanford's
Minority Hiring Program implemented in June of
1968. As of March 1969 this program had
achieved only 73 percent of the minority
employment goal. The small increase in the
number of Mexican-American employees, only
19 percent, is in part attributable to the lack of
adequate low rent housing in the Stanford area.
The hiring of Blacks has been more successful in
part because of the large Black population
already existing in East Palo Alto. Insofar as
housing and employment are coupled, Stanford
must re-evaluate the local housing situation for
lower income groups. The relations between
housing and job opportunities are carefully
explored in a report prepared by the National
Committee against Discrimination in Housing.
For a low income individual adequate
transportation provides as much of a barrier to
his finding satisfactory employment as does
racial or economic bias.
There is no indication that building trends in
the Stanford/Palo Alto area will alleviate these
problems. Essentially all new construction in the
area is for industrial/business complexes or
high-priced luxury apartment units. In fact these
other types of building will increase the demand
for lower income employees, and thus increase
the demand for appropriate housing.
Nature of the Stanford Community
The Stanford community, not unlike most
American universities, has always been segregated
along both social and economic lines. Although
this segregation has hardly been deliberate, it has
had an important and generally undesirable
influence upon the thinking, experience and
attitudes of faculty, staff and students. With the
ever increasing awareness in our society of the

conditions of our fellow men, this segregation
becomes even more obviously discordant with
the goals and aspirations which should pervade
the university atmosphere. In recognition of the
University's responsibility the Minority Hiring
Program and efforts to increase minority student
enrollment were begun in 1968. Despite efforts
of this type the segregated nature of campus life
has changed only slowly in the past years.
Certainly the nature of the community has not
kept pace with the social thinking of its
constituents.
FINANCIAL CONSIDERATIONS
However desirable or necessary a housing
project may seem, it cannot become a reality
unless the financial means are available to
construct and operate the project in ways which
meet its goals. In these days of record-high
interest rates, soaring construction costs and high
land costs, the financial package becomes the key
factor in determining whether a project is
feasible or not feasible. From the beginning of
the Committee's investigation it became clear to
us that some form(s) of subsidy will be required
if a low-cost or low-rent project is to materialize.
The subsidy may involve raw land, construction
grants, low-interest loans, continuing interest
subsidy payments, direct rent subsidies to
tenants, or a combination of these.
Methods of Financing
The methods of financing and an evaluation
of them include:
a. Gilts or Grants -Obviously, a lower rent
structure can be achieved if part or all of the
project is subsidized with grants and loans of
money or raw land which do not need to be
amortized Gift funds in the past have been
used for student residence halls and fraternity
clusters, though the latter were specifically
solicited from fraternity alumni. The Pine Hill
and Frenchman's 1 Hill faculty-staff
subdivisions are subsidized through a donation
of raw land. The land subsidy for a low cost
housing project seems to be the most likely
method of subsidy from University resources.
Even here, the Board of Trustees may face
legal restrictions on the use of this resource if
the project includes persons not affiliated
with the University.
b. University Funds—lt seems likely that the
Board of Trustees will continue its present
policy of prudent flexibility with its
investable funds. For housing, this means
there is little chance of committing long-term
funds as a University investment. Rather, any
direct financial participation of the University
could come in the form of (1) seed money to
assist its own or a private non-profit housing
sponsor with organizational expenses, and/or
(2) interest subsidies or direct rent subsidies.
In other words, the University should obtain
leverage with any of its funds committed to a
project.
It should be noted that Wesleyan
University in Middletown, Conn., and the
University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia
have recently announced plans for investment
of university funds in community housing
projects. While the situations obviously differ
somewhat from the midpeninsula situation,
the important point is that some universities
are getting involved in community affairs
financially.
c. U.S. Government Sources—The San
Francisco office of the Housing and Urban
Development Agency is a valuable resource
for information and assistance. However, the
modes and shades of assistance are so vast that
definitive answers from HUD are directly
dependent upon definitive questions and
proposals from Stanford University.
Therefore, our report at this time is limited to
some possibilities of assistance and our
impression of the most likely program suited
to Stanford's situation.
(1) FHA-Sections 235 and 236 of the
Housing and Urban Development Act of
1968 appear to provide the most likely
source of funds for a low rent project on or
near Stanford University lands.
Section 235 provides assistance in the
form of monthly payments by Hud to the
mortgagee to reduce interest costs on a
market rate home mortgage insured by
FHA to as low as 1 percent if the
homeowner cannot afford the mortgage
payment with 20 percent of his income.
The amount of subsidy will vary
according to the income of each
homeowner and the total amount of the
mortgage payment at the market rate of
interest. Family income and mortgage
limits are established for eligiblity in each
locality. For this area the maximum
income for a family of four to receive any
assistance would be about $6,600.
Section 236 is applicable "to
multi-family rental or cooperative housing
projects for families of low or moderate
incomes. The assistance is provided in the
form of monthly payments to the
mortgagee to reduce costs to the occupant
by paying a part of the interest of a market
rate project mortgage insured by FHA.
Though the San Francisco office of
FHA has allocated all of its 1968-69 funds
for Section 236 to approximately 50
projects in the eleven western states,
officials there are optimistic that the Nixon
administration will provide further funds
this fiscal year.
(2)Housing Assistance Authority. This
division of HUD in San Francisco is
concerned chiefly with publicly-owned
housing projects. Normally, HAA cannot
become involved in projects on the land of
a college or university. However, the San
Francisco office is seeking university
support for a plan which would permit a
project on university land if the institution
agreed to accept approximately one-third
non-students in the project. This is just an
idea generated at the San Francisco office
and would require not only fairly broad
support among universities but would
require top administrative approval in
Washington. A time lag would surely be
involved.
d. Commercial Sources-~The University'could
approach a low-rent housing project on its
own, with or without government assistance,
through loans from the commercial money
market. Though the theory has not been
tested, University finance officials feel that
the University should be able to borrow
significant amounts for real estate projects by
pledging the "full faith and credit" of the
University. Under its founding grant, the
University cannot mortgage its real estate
holdings thus, the "full faith and credit"
approach could be a way of getting around
this restriction.
The big problem at the present time, of
course, is the high cost of money. The current
prime rate is IVi percent, and most real estate
loans at the present time are at 8 to B'/4 percent.
The general feeling in the financial community
seems to be that these high interest rates will
prevail for a period of several yrars. In this
period of high demand and short supply, the
university should be able to borrow money as
cheaply as or better than most other borrowers.
However, University finance officials warn
against long term commitments at high interest
rates and suggest that short term commitments
with refinancing privileges at lower rates be
sought.
Taxes
The University Business Manager has received
a written opinion from the Santa Clara County
Assessor that any project involving non-students
would be subject to real property taxes. This
would be true if non-students were to be housed
in Escondido Vollage and obviously would be
true in any new project involving non-students. A
realistic tax figure to use would be 2 to 2V4
percent of the full market value of the land and
its improvements involved. As an example of
what this means to the rent structure, if faculty
and staff are introduced into Escondido Village,
it is estimated that the rent of those apartments
would have to be increased approximately $35
per month to cover the taxes on those units.
Any decision to use presently tax-exempt land
for a low cost housing project will have to be
approached with caution by top officials of the
University in order not to jeopardize the
tax-exempt status of surrounding University
lands.
Rental Structure
The rental structure of any project on
Stanford land will be subject to a large number
of variables, including cost (if any) of land,
availability of utilities, the size of the project,
type of unit, etc. For the broad purposes of this
report, we are assuming a minimum cost of
$15,000 for a one-bedroom furnished apartment
on a reasonably level plot, to a high of $25,000
for a three-bedroom furnished apartment on a
more difficult piece of land. At current market,
full cost rentals would run from $175 to $275
Der month.
The main purpose of a housing program
sponsored by the University would be to provide
housing for less rent than similar housing in the
area. A subsidy of raw land would facilitate a
rent reduction of only about $14 per month per
apartment. This is based upon an assumed land
cost of $2,000 per apartment, paid off with
interest at 7'/2 percent over 30 years.
Truly significant rental reductions can be
achieved only through Federal interest subsidy
programs, such as Section 236 of the Housing
and Urban Development Act of 1968. HUD pays
the difference between the market rate of
interest and 1 percent over the life of the loan.
On a $25,000 apartment, the rent reduction
could run as high as $95 per month for a person
having an income of $5,000 or less. Thus, we
estimate that a combination of land gift and
interest subsidy could lower the rent up to 30%
below the commercial market.
The University is in a unique position to make
a major contribution to solving the problem of a
lack of low-rent housing, simply by making its
idle land available for housing. Whether the land
is leased at no cost or at fair market value is a
lesser decision.
Other Forms of Assistance
While assistance is generally thought of in
terms of rental housing, other forms of assistance
should not be overlooked. For example, Section
235 is designed to assist low-income purchases of
homes, cooperatives and condominiums. Section
106 provides for technical assistance and
interest-free loans for pre-construction costs of
non-profit sponsors. Section 231 deals with
rental housing for the elderly on low-income-a
possibility for emeritus housing.
POSSIBLE UNIVERSITY
PROGRAMS
It is difficult as well as presumptious to
formulate a program for housing development
without considering all the relevant facts and
needs. What this section attempts to do is to lay
down a prel-iminary framework, within which it
will be possible to make concrete proposals. With
that stipulation, it should be noted that it is
imperative to place any set of recommendations
within the context of community planning for
increasingly scarce land. We propose the
development of communities which offer their
residents not only some low-cost housing, but
the opportunity for community design, planning
and management, as well as facilities providing
for the social and recreational needs of the
residents.

Among such developments are the following
types:
Capsule Community Project: The idea of a
capsule community is best typified in
already-existing housing by The Hacienda, on
Escondido Road. It is small, economically
integrated, communal in that it shares at least a
common patio and courtyard, and lends itself
very well to being based on educational or social
"themes." Because thsi kind of cluster housing is
architecturally unobstrusive, and possesses a
distinctive charm, it is also desirable for
non-thematic housing which may be scattered
around campus, utilizing different architectural
styles. This kind of housing may lend itself to
low-cost construction, and to "sweat-equity"
development, hence it is desirable to investigate
the feasibility of using pre-fabricated materials to
duplicate the adobe style of The Hacienda.
There are three areas which lend themselves to
this kind of "dotting" -the Escondido-Bowdoin
area immediately adjacent to The Hacienda,
covering 10 acres; the Carnegie Lab-Medical
School area, about 50 acres, and the 18 acre lot
which separated Frenchman's Hill from the
Industrial Park. There are also a number of areas
within Frenchman's Hill where there are several
adjacent lots which have not yet been leased. The
goal of economically integrated housing would
be served by using these lots for the creation of
student, staff, and junior faculty housing of a
low-rise or townhouse nature, with open space
provided for recreational facilities.
Because these sites are the most readily
developed, we recommend that this kind of
housing be developed first. The development of
low-cost housing in areas which presently include
high-cost housing and industry is a relatively easy
method of achieving integrated housing.
Residential Community Project: There are
four sites which are slightly larger and may be
utilized for various kinds of housing
developments. The Sandhill Road-SLAC area
covers 150 acres; the Searsville Lake area is 60
acres; the Willow Road-shopping center area is 48
acres, and the Interdale area is 30 acres. With the
exception of the Searsville Lake area, this land is
situated close to shopping, and to some light
industry.
In addition to using this land as "bedrooms,"
the University may have special needs which
include the use of educational facilities. Thus,
there could be space for classrooms, for weekend
retreats, for small librarires, for clusters of
residences centered around particular educational
themes or personal goals. Since there is no way
to predict how the residents will perceive their
own needs from year to year, it could be
administered by them cooperatively.
Cooperative administration will also be
necessary to avoid increasing the parking
problem on campus. Some kind of mini-bus
shuttle service might be run by the residents in
exchange for rental reductions.
Economic integration of this kind of
development means provision for all kinds of
student housing, for junior faculty housing, and
for low-income staff members. Senior faculty
could lease land for building homes, but the need
for rental units of moderate and low cost is much
greater. The opening of this housing to
low-income workers who are not affiliated with
Stanford seems to depend on the tax assessment
of the land, but it should be kept in mind that
the most central question is how much low-rent
housing is available in the area, and how the
development of land for industrial use increases
the number of workers without providing
adequate housing.
Balanced Community Project: This concept is
one that is particularly desirable for large parcels
of land which have not yet been developed. It
deals with problems of financing and
transportation as well as those of land utilization,
by providing an area which is used for both
residential and industrial purposes. We have
considered three sites as suitable for this kind of
development—the Webb and Conley Ranches,
covering 660 acres; the Sandhill Road-Whiskey
Hill Road area, covering 240 acres, and the Page
Mill Road-Arastradero Road area, including one
parcel of 220 acres and another of 50 acres.
Land developed as a balanced community
provides a tax base for the residents of the
community, enabling them to be creative with
respect to economic integration. Not unlike the
"new towns," the community must provide most
of its own educational and recreational facilities.
In addition to the obvious needs for schools,
shopping facilities and sports areas, it should also
function as a community with respect to its own
social needs. Decisions about community affairs
ought to be made by all the residents, both
industrial management and residential members.
Facilities for this must therefore be included in
the planning community centers, meeting places
both formal and informal. The spirit of a

balanced community centers around the idea of a
"village atmosphere" and while it is not possible
to predict what needs the community may feel
itself to have, it is possible to plan for facilities
which will encourage this atmosphere.
In addition to being "mixed" with respect to
industry and housing, a balanced community
includes economic integration in housing. Thus,
this kind of development includes within it the
other types of housing. It provides housing for
workers of the local industries, at levels ranging
from maintenance staff to high-level
management, and to student, faculty, and staff
members of the University. While some of the
members of the Community would therefore be
transient, they would be able to function as
members of a community during their stay.
Some of the homes would be rental units, others
would be owned either as single-family dwellings,
or as cooperative apartments, condominiums, or
townhouses.
In a community of this size there is room for
experimentation; thus there may be areas set
aside for "sweat-equity" housing, where
individuals build part of their own homes. The
University may wish to utilize its own skills with
respect to developing and building prototypes of
housing and recreational facilities. Within the
Webb and Conley Ranch areas, there is room for
cabins for hosteling, for hiking trails, and for
agricultural use. The land is presently used for
cattle raising, horse training, flower and
strawberry growing—it may be desirable to retain
these uses, not only as an educational aim, but to
prevent the growth of a kind of suburbia which is
as divorced from its roots in the agricultural
tradition as it is from city life. Sprinkling houses
in the midst of an industrial park is not what is
envisioned.
We feel that this use of the land would enable
the University to fulfill some of its financial
needs, and to provide housing for members of
the Stanford community and the neighboring
area. As important, however, is the responsibility
of a large land-holder to develop intelligent and
creative use of its land to meet the needs of a
rapidly growing population. This kind of
development involves a considerable amount of
long range planning and should be considered for
all major future developments on Stanford lands.
Site Descriptions
The various sites are described below in terms
of topography, proximity of existing utilities,
neighboring facilities, roads, etc.
Capsule Com m unity Projects:
1) Frenchman's Hill—Utilizing the already
subdivided land which is unsold. All utilities and
improvements available. These lots can be
developed immediately for low-income housing.
2) Page Mill-Industrial Park Hill area—(about
18 acres) A hilltop location overlooking College
Terrace and Frenchman's Hill and across Page
Mill Road from the Hewlett-Packard building.
There are some steep grades but all utilities are
close by.
3) Escondido-Bowdoin area—(about 10 acres)
This site lies between Campus Drive, Bowdoin
Road extended, and Escondido Road. Flat land
available for development with all utilities close
by.
4) Carnegie Lab-Medical School area—(about
50 acres) This site lying southeast of Willow
Road and bordered on the east by Campus Drive.
Easily developed.
Residential Community Projects:
1) Interdale area—(about 30 acres) Gently
sloping land dotted with oak trees and easily
accessible to road and sewer facilities on Alpine
Road.
2) Willow Road-Creek area—(about 48 acres)
This site is located between the Convalescent
Hospital and the new Oak Creek Apartments.
Flat land with utilities close by. Easy access to
shopping.
3) Searsville Lake area—(about 60 acres)
Rolling hills located on western edge of Searsville
Lake to Portola Road. This site will require an
investment for utilities.
4) Sandhill Road-SLAC area—(about 150
acres) Gently sloping land lying between Sandhill
Road and the Accelerator. Too limited for a
balanced community but would provide enough
space for the amenities of the residential
community. Utilities are available a short
distance away.
balanced Community Projects:
1) Webb-Conley Ranch area—(about 660
acres) This large valley is surrounded by low hills
and bisected by Junipero Serra Freeway and San
Francisquito Creek. It offers a unique
opportunity for a large scale balanced
community. This project will require extensive
development costs in sewer, and roads, but it also
will provide the largest single developable area on
campus lands.
2) Page Mill Road-Arastradero Road
area—(about 270 acres) Low foothills backed bv

steep hills. Easily accessible from existing streets,
this site will lend itself to a limited type of
balanced community.
3) Sandhill Road-Whiskey Hill Road
area—(about 240 acres) This land is gently
sloping and could well be utilized for a balanced
community. Utilities will have to be developed.
CONCLUSIONS AND
RECOMMENDATIONS
There is ample evidence for the existence of a
severe housing shortage and the contribution
made to it by the University's own land
development program and its inadequate supply
of housing for its students and staff. These
are indisputable. What might be disputed, and
what therefore should be examined carefully, is a
policy position urging the University to take
action to help remedy the problem. The
argument against the adoption of such a policy
position is a familiar one. It states that the first
responsibility of the University is to advance and
disseminate knowledge. Thus Stanford should
direct all of its resources towards creating the
optimum environment for the education of its
students. Expenditures of time and money by
the University should be restricted to the hiring
of outstanding faculty, the construction of
dorms, libraries and research facilities and other
efforts directly beneficial to educational
objectives. It argues that since resources are
scarce, Stanford should concentrate on only its
primary responsibility education, no matter how
attractive alternative projects may be.
There is much strength ir> this argument but
many factors dictate that the University must
take a broader view of its place in society. There
is an accelerating awareness among students,
faculty and members of the community that
"education" can no longer exist in isolation from
society as a whole. Education now must include
active involvement in the community and in the
nation, a nation which is in the midst of a
domestic crisis without precedent since the Civil
War. This University could not avoid involvement
in that crisis if it chose to. The fact is that it
cannot even choose to, for universities in general
and Stanford in particular are citizens of their
communities, in ways that are not shared by
business, churches, or even governments. We list
but a few of these ways as they relate to
Stanford: 1. The largest proportion of the
faculty and a large share of the student body
literally do live in neighboring communities, and
they are inevitably identified as Stanford people
in a way that employees of Lockheed or Philco
are simply not identified with their companies. 2.
Stanford employs 8000 people and is the second
largest employer on the Peninsula, it is large, it is
visible, it is important. 3. The University owns
9000 acres of land, most of it as yet
undeveloped. 4. Faculty and students of the
University have for years used neighboring
communities, especially East Palo Alto, as
research and teaching laboratories. Growing
hostility to what is viewed as a form of
exploitation is closing off those opportunities.
It would be fatuous to deny that the
University has made a major contribution to the
development of the midpeninsula area. It would
be equally blind to deny that that very
development has, with all of its benefits,
produced problems that threaten social
disruption of very serious proportions. Although
Stanford shares the responsibility to prevent this
disruption with many of society's other
institutions, Stanford also has a special
responsibility imposedsby the special nature and
interests of the University. Added to this is the
special opportunity available to Stanford, largely
because it commands the invaluable resources of
land, leadership capacity and creative
intelligence. In addition to having the resource of
land which could be used to facilitate the
development of low andsmoderate rent housing
Stanford has the unique resource of its people. In
carrying out both the preliminary andsdetailed
planning of any housing development the
University should utilize this second,;resource to
the fullest extent. In this case, such..utilization
would involve the Department of Architecture,
members of the University Planning Department,
the Business School, departments such as
Sociology, Psychology, Economics andsPolitical
Science, and other disciplines which relate to
questions of social planning.
Because there is a major housing problem in
our area and because the Committee considers
the University as having a special responsibility
and ability to assist in the solution of the
problem it has agreed unanimously that Stanford
should establish a low-rent housing development
of significant size on its campus; that the general
public as well as those associated-with Stanford
be eligible to live in the development; that the
land required be made available at no cost; and
that the funds required for the planning of such a
development be made available promptly
