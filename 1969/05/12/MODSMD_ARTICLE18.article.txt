# Star-Studded Films On Tap
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
This is an unusually
star-studded week for films, with
Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger,
Gary Grant and Steve McQueen
making appearances on campus
screens.
The 1959 crime meller, AI
Cap one, will be shown on
Tuesday at 8 and 10 in Geology
320. Though basically a grade-B
production, the film is raised out
of its class somewhat by the
intelligent performance of Rod
Steiger in the leading role. Also
featured are Fay Spain, Nehemiah
Persoff and Martin Balsam.
Due to certain commercial
considerations and a rather
conventional style of animations,
the 1954 production of Animal
Farm does not convey the full
satiric flavor of George Orwell's
book. However, it was, until
recently, Britain's only
feature-length cartoon and can be
appreciated as a noble
experiment. This Western Civ
movie will be presented in
Cubberley on Tuesday and
Wednesday at 4:15 and 7:30.
Director Elia Kazan borrowed
a great deal from Sergei
Eisenstein in developing the stark,
hard-hitting tone of Viva Zapata.
The results are uneven. The acting
from Marlon Brando and
Anthony Quinn on down, is
uniformly superb, but John
Stcinbeck's script alternates
between stock revolutionary
jargon and "liberal" Hollywood
political flak of the '50's. At
Cubberley on Thursday at 7:30.
This week's I-Center film is
Lazarilio, a 1960 Spanish picture
based on the classic 16th-centry
novel, El Lazarilio de Tormes.
Played against an impressive
background of Spanish castles,
villages and landscapes, the film

pits a 12-year-old boy against a
succession of adult rogues and
vagabonds. It will be shown in
Physics Tank on Thursday at
8:15.
Carl Dreyer's The Passion of
Joan of Arc is regarded as one of
the very great silent films, being
an examination in close-up of the
anguished emotions which
accompanied Joan's five laborous
cross-examinations detailed here.
The faces in the film are
remarkably vivid, due to the
stunning photography and to the
fact that the actors used no
makeup. This film, made at the
end of the silent era, will be
accompanied by the
prize-winning French short, The
Red Balloon. In Cubberley on
Friday night.

Aparajito at Tresidder on
Friday, is the second segment of
Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy.
Apu and his family move to the
teeming banks of the Ganges and
from this, Hay creates a vivid
mosaic of modern India as well as
subliminally conveying the life
tempo of the country.
Hitchcock's North by
Northwest is a widely improbable
but very entertaining spy intrigue.
Ernest Lehman reports that he
wrote the script without knowing
the outcome of the mystery, but
the scene on Mount Rushmore
and the crop-dusting chase rank
among the classic Hitchcockian
sequences. The attractive cast
includes Gary Grant, Eva Marie
Saint, James Mason, Leo G.
Carroll and Martin Landau.
Most people have probably
seen The Great F.scape at least
once, but even after three
viewings, I have found it to
remain highly entertaining and
exciting. Under John Sturges'
direction, the film is among the
best of the World War II action
pictures, due in no small part to
its cast of Steve McQueen, James
Garner, Richard Attenborough,
James Coburn, Charles Bronson
and David McCallum. At the
Sunday flicks.

mosaic of modern India as well as
subliminally conveying the life
tempo of the country.
Hitchcock's North by
Northwest is a widely improbable
but very entertaining spy intrigue.
Ernest Lehman reports that he
wrote the script without knowing
the outcome of the mystery, but
the scene on Mount Rushmore
and the crop-dusting chase rank
among the classic Hitchcockian
sequences. The attractive cast
includes Gary Grant, Eva Marie
Saint, James Mason, Leo G.
Carroll and Martin Landau.
Most people have probably
seen The Great F.scape at least
once, but even after three
viewings, I have found it to
remain highly entertaining and
exciting. Under John Sturges'
direction, the film is among the
best of the World War II action
pictures, due in no small part to
its cast of Steve McQueen, James
Garner, Richard Attenborough,
James Coburn, Charles Bronson
and David McCallum. At the
Sunday flicks.
This is an unusually
star-studded week for films, with
Marlon Brando, Rod Steiger,
Gary Grant and Steve McQueen
making appearances on campus
screens.
The 1959 crime meller, AI
Cap one, will be shown on
Tuesday at 8 and 10 in Geology
320. Though basically a grade-B
production, the film is raised out
of its class somewhat by the
intelligent performance of Rod
Steiger in the leading role. Also
featured are Fay Spain, Nehemiah
Persoff and Martin Balsam.
Due to certain commercial
considerations and a rather
conventional style of animations,
the 1954 production of Animal
Farm does not convey the full
satiric flavor of George Orwell's
book. However, it was, until
recently, Britain's only
feature-length cartoon and can be
appreciated as a noble
experiment. This Western Civ
movie will be presented in
Cubberley on Tuesday and
Wednesday at 4:15 and 7:30.
Director Elia Kazan borrowed
a great deal from Sergei
Eisenstein in developing the stark,
hard-hitting tone of Viva Zapata.
The results are uneven. The acting
from Marlon Brando and
Anthony Quinn on down, is
uniformly superb, but John
Stcinbeck's script alternates
between stock revolutionary
jargon and "liberal" Hollywood
political flak of the '50's. At
Cubberley on Thursday at 7:30.
This week's I-Center film is
Lazarilio, a 1960 Spanish picture
based on the classic 16th-centry
novel, El Lazarilio de Tormes.
Played against an impressive
background of Spanish castles,
villages and landscapes, the film

pits a 12-year-old boy against a
succession of adult rogues and
vagabonds. It will be shown in
Physics Tank on Thursday at
8:15.
Carl Dreyer's The Passion of
Joan of Arc is regarded as one of
the very great silent films, being
an examination in close-up of the
anguished emotions which
accompanied Joan's five laborous
cross-examinations detailed here.
The faces in the film are
remarkably vivid, due to the
stunning photography and to the
fact that the actors used no
makeup. This film, made at the
end of the silent era, will be
accompanied by the
prize-winning French short, The
Red Balloon. In Cubberley on
Friday night.

Aparajito at Tresidder on
Friday, is the second segment of
Satyajit Ray's The Apu Trilogy.
Apu and his family move to the
teeming banks of the Ganges and
from this, Hay creates a vivid
mosaic of modern India as well as
subliminally conveying the life
tempo of the country.
