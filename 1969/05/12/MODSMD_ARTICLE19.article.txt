# Nixon: One Of Shivers'?
## 
### 
James David Barber, a noted
political scientist, currently doing
a masssive study of the
presidency, spoke in Bishop
Auditorium last Thursday. He
expressed the fact that Richard
Nixon along with past presidents
Lyndon Johnson and Herbert
Hoover fall into a class of
politicians called "the striver."
The "striver" is basically a
hypersensitive person with
feelings of inferiority. This type
of politician tends to react to any
challenges to his position with
intense moral justification of self
and aggression towards his
opponents.
This behavior pattern usually
ends in a "freezed course" of
action on which he stakes his
worth as a person. Barber said
that this pattern began to develop
in the Johnson administration
when in November, 1963 LBJ
said, "I am not going to lose in
Vietnam."
Barber expressed the fear the
Nixon possesses the same kind of
political personality, although his
administration was too new for a
judgment to be made.
