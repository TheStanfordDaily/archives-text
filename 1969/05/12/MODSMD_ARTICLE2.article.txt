# First Encina Decisions
## Probations, Fines Given 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Four student participants in the
Encina Hall sit-in whose cases were
heard upon their request by the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) last
week have been placed on probation
until graduation from Stanford and
given $75 fines.
Additionally a hearing has been set
for Wednesday evening in the Law
School for those students on suspension
who have not yet requested a hearing.
According to Jack Friedenthal,
chairman of the SJC, the purpose of the
hearing is to "request the students to
request a hearing."
The decision reached over the
weekend is the first to be made by the
Council concerning the May 1 Encina
Hall incident. No cases have yet gone
before the Council regarding the sit-in at
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
The decision "unanimously
recommended" by the nine-member
body calls for students to be placed
"upon probation until his graduation
from the University, to receive a formal
reprimand from the University President
and to pay a fine of $75 at an
appropriate time as recommended by
the Council."
Basis for Decision
The Council emphasized in the
decision that in the cases of those
students found guilty, the student had
committed no previous offense of this
type, that the student's total
involvement was minimal, and that the
student sought hearing promptly and
cooperated in every way with the
Council.
The SJC also took note that no other
pending charges had been brought to
the attention of the Council regarding
the students involved.
The names of the students were not
released. The decision now goes to
President Pitzer for acceptance. Thus far
Pitzer has accepted two of five decisions
which have been brought to his
attention.
The additional decision reached last
Tuesday was an acquital, lifting the
suspension of one student who was not
involved.
The decision, in effect, does not

prescribe any punishment, but app
to any subsequent offenses.
Notification Forthcoming
Students are expected to receive a
letter in the mail this morning regarding
the hearing Wednesday. Thus far the list
of names of students on suspension has
grown to 72.
FriedenthaJ indicated that suspended
students attending the hearing and
receiving a time and place would have
their suspensions removed. Such a
recommendation by the Council would
have to be okayed by President Pitzer.
In any case, Friedenthal noted that
any discussion of such a hearing was
non-negotiable. The procedure to be
taken in the event that students fail to
appear Wednesday evening is unclear,
although the judicial charter states that
graduation will be held up for seniors,
and that other students will be barred
from registration.
SJC DECISION TEXT
1. Every student who has been
temporarily suspended for his alleged
involvement in the occupation of
Encina Hall and who has not had a time
for a hearing set has been sent a letter
requiring him to appear before the
Council on Wednesday, May 14, 1969.
At that time a date will be set for a
formal hearing of each student's case.
Upon the setting of such a date, the
Council will recommend to the
University President that he
immediately lift the student's
temporary suspension. Any student who
has been suspended, has been and is still
free to request voluntarily that a
specific time be set for a hearing. Upon
such a request the Council now sets a
Lime for hearing and immediately
recommends that the student's
temporary suspension be lifted. The
University President has approved each
such recommendation that has been
submitted to him.
2. The Council has now heard a
number of cases involving the Encina
Hall incident. The punishment
unanimously recommended for those
who so far have been found guilty is as
follows:

(a) The student be placed upon
probation until his graduation from the
University;
(b) The student receive a formal
reprimand from the University
President;
(c) The student pay a fine of $75 at
an appropriate time as recommended by
the Council.
In making the above
recommendations the Council found the
following factors to be of considerable
importance:
(i) The student had committed no
previous offense of this type.
(ii) The student's total involvement
was minimal.
(iii) The student sought hearing
promptly and cooperated in every way
with the Council.
(iv) No other pending charges had
been brought to the attention of the
Council regarding the student.
The first of these cases has been sent
to the President and has his approval.

Basis for Decision
The Council emphasized in the
decision that in the cases of those
students found guilty, the student had
committed no previous offense of this
type, that the student's total
involvement was minimal, and that the
student sought hearing promptly and
cooperated in every way with the
Council.
The SJC also took note that no other
pending charges had been brought to
the attention of the Council regarding
the students involved.
The names of the students were not
released. The decision now goes to
President Pitzer for acceptance. Thus far
Pitzer has accepted two of five decisions
which have been brought to his
attention.
The additional decision reached last
Tuesday was an acquital, lifting the
suspension of one student who was not
involved.
The decision, in effect, does not

prescribe any punishment, but app
to any subsequent offenses.
Notification Forthcoming
Students are expected to receive a
letter in the mail this morning regarding
the hearing Wednesday. Thus far the list
of names of students on suspension has
grown to 72.
FriedenthaJ indicated that suspended
students attending the hearing and
receiving a time and place would have
their suspensions removed. Such a
recommendation by the Council would
have to be okayed by President Pitzer.
In any case, Friedenthal noted that
any discussion of such a hearing was
non-negotiable. The procedure to be
taken in the event that students fail to
appear Wednesday evening is unclear,
although the judicial charter states that
graduation will be held up for seniors,
and that other students will be barred
from registration.
SJC DECISION TEXT
1. Every student who has been
temporarily suspended for his alleged
involvement in the occupation of
Encina Hall and who has not had a time
for a hearing set has been sent a letter
requiring him to appear before the
Council on Wednesday, May 14, 1969.
At that time a date will be set for a
formal hearing of each student's case.
Upon the setting of such a date, the
Council will recommend to the
University President that he
immediately lift the student's
temporary suspension. Any student who
has been suspended, has been and is still
free to request voluntarily that a
specific time be set for a hearing. Upon
such a request the Council now sets a
Lime for hearing and immediately
recommends that the student's
temporary suspension be lifted. The
University President has approved each
such recommendation that has been
submitted to him.
2. The Council has now heard a
number of cases involving the Encina
Hall incident. The punishment
unanimously recommended for those
who so far have been found guilty is as
follows:

(a) The student be placed upon
probation until his graduation from the
University;
(b) The student receive a formal
reprimand from the University
President;
(c) The student pay a fine of $75 at
an appropriate time as recommended by
the Council.
In making the above
recommendations the Council found the
following factors to be of considerable
importance:
(i) The student had committed no
previous offense of this type.
(ii) The student's total involvement
was minimal.
(iii) The student sought hearing
promptly and cooperated in every way
with the Council.
(iv) No other pending charges had
been brought to the attention of the
Council regarding the student.
The first of these cases has been sent
to the President and has his approval.
Four student participants in the
Encina Hall sit-in whose cases were
heard upon their request by the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC) last
week have been placed on probation
until graduation from Stanford and
given $75 fines.
Additionally a hearing has been set
for Wednesday evening in the Law
School for those students on suspension
who have not yet requested a hearing.
According to Jack Friedenthal,
chairman of the SJC, the purpose of the
hearing is to "request the students to
request a hearing."
The decision reached over the
weekend is the first to be made by the
Council concerning the May 1 Encina
Hall incident. No cases have yet gone
before the Council regarding the sit-in at
the Applied Electronics Laboratory.
The decision "unanimously
recommended" by the nine-member
body calls for students to be placed
"upon probation until his graduation
from the University, to receive a formal
reprimand from the University President
and to pay a fine of $75 at an
appropriate time as recommended by
the Council."
