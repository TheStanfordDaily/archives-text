## Varsity Crew Takes Cal 
### 
The Stanford varsity shell beat
California in Saturday's Big Row
by five seconds by salvage an
otherwise unhappy day for the
Indian oarsmen. Cal had won the
JV, third varsity, and two frosh
races to win the Jim Reynolds
Cup on points. The varsity time
was 6:19.6 over 2000 meters of
windy Oakland Estuary water. It
was Stanford's fourth consecutive
win over Cal.
The Bears led off with wins
over the second frosh and third
varsity crews by two lengths and

haJI-a-length, respectively. 1 he
Stanford thirds came back after a
disastrous start in the choppy
water to challenge Cal at the
finish, but they had just too far to
go.
Next to fall were the first frosh
and the JV's, each by less than a
length. The Bear frosh jumped out
to a small lead at the start, but the
Indian yearlings came back to lead
by almost a length at the half-way
point. They could not hold the
lead, though, as C aJ came
storming back to a seven-seat
advantage that held to the finish.
The .JV's too blew an initial
lead in their race, as Cal's
mid-course "hard twenty" opened
up a six-seat lead. The Bear JV's
held off Stanford's sprint and won
by 3.5 seconds.
The varsity race broke this
pattern. Jumping out to a

halt-length lead at the start, the
Indians were never headed and
barely needed to spring at the
finish to win by open water.
Coach Will Condon was especially
pleased by this performance as it
represented a "jelling" of the
team from earlier races. Against
both Washington and UCLA, the
co-favorites in next week's
Western Sprints, Stanford lost
after taking early leads. Against
Cat, Condon felt the varsity rowed
a much smarter race.
The Indians head South next
week for the Western Sprints
championships in San Diego. This
is a two-day regatta that
determines the West Coast
champion, and will afford
Stanford an opportunity for
revenge from some of its earlier
defeats.


GLAD II AND-Stanford outfielder Ron ShotLs gets a warm welcome from teammates as he scores on his three-run homer
in last weekend's game against California. The big blow helped the Tribe romp to a 10-4 win in the tight Pac-8 race. Asa
sophomore, Shotts was a hitting star witli 7 home runs and 31 RBl's. Lite slugging power seems to have returned.
