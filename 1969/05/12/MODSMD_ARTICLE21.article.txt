# Intramural Meet
## El Toro Wins Track Crown 
### 
El Toro swept to its third
straight intramural track
championship last Monday and
Wednesday on Angel Field,
amassing 66 points to outdistance
the Theta Delts and the Phuds,
each with 37. Toro captured six
running events, two field events,
and added the relay to finish first
in nine of the fourteen events.
Four double winners more
than guaranteed Toro victory.
Doug Anderson set new
intramural records while winning
both hurdle races, Mark Jones
added the mile and two-mile,
Charlie Carrera won the long and
triple jumps, and Tim Nicholson
dominated the 440 and 880. The
latter two led off and anchored
respectively on the Toro relay,
which overhauled the Phuds and a
team of independents to win one
of the closest races of the day.

The Theta Delts, meanwhile,
relied on a first and second in the
high jump and Armstrong's 220
victory and second-place 100
finish for most of their points.
The Phuds added places in ten
events to their relay points to
match the Theta Delts, and
surpass the Kappa Sigs, Chi Psi,
the Delts, and Cro Mem.
