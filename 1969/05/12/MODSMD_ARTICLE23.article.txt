The Pac-8 baseball logjam
continues. Stanford and UCLA

into today's double-headers still
tied for the league lead.
The Indians came from behind
with three runs in the ninth inning
to edge the Washington State
Cougars 5-4 on Friday in Pullman,
then swept a pair from the
Washington Huskies at Seattle
Saturday. UCLA downed Oregon
4-1 on Friday, then won two from
Oregon State Saturday. Stanford
and UCLA are thus tied for first
with 12-4 records this morning.
The USC Trojans won three times
alos and have now won 11 and
lost 5. Cal stands fourth at 10-6.
Trailing 4-2 going into the
ninth inning of Friday's game, the
Tribe loaded the bases and got
one run on a single by Mark
Marquess. Then shortstop Russ
Tweet lined a double to right to
drive in two more. Phil Keller got
the win in relief. Right fielder Bob
Marshall hit a 360-foot homer in
the third and made a run-saving
catch in the first.
On Saturday sophs Jim Coate
and Steve Dunning both went the
distance fotr the Indians as
Stanford won 5-1 and 8-2 over the
Huskies. Dunning gave up only
four hits in the nightcap.
