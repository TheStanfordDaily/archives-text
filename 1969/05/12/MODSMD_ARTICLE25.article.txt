# While Stanford Sleeps...
## 
### 
During the brief respite that the SDS and allied
groups have allowed us prior to whatever student
strikes or other "symbolic gestures" they can manu
facture before Dead Week, it is appropriate to ex
amine what has happened to Stanford in the past
month, and to ask some questions about those
events.
Such a review should be valuable to the entire
campus community, for Stanford and the demo
cratic process have been deeply imperiled by the
seemingly noble and innocent April Third Move
ment.
The "Issues"
First, the "issues" in the matter: chemical, bio
logical and radiological research and counter
insurgency work at SRI, and "death research" on
the campus. What real validity did they have?
Precious little. There is no biological warfare re
search at SRI, nor any radiological work of that
nature. There are two unclassified projects with a
current backlog equivalent to the efforts of one man
for one year. One ends in July and deals with
particle-size distribution of powders that will not
dissolve in water. The second is a basic study of
enzyme production leading to the possible develop
ment of systems for detecting bacteriological agents
which might be deployed against this country. It
runs until next year. Furthermore, on April 8, before
the AEL sit-in, the Board of Trustees asked SRI
not to accept any further CBW work pending com
pletion of the study of Stanford-SRI relations.
As for counter-insurgency work, SRI is engaged
in efforts to support existing governments. But the
question must be asked: Why not? Simply because
the resident campus Maoist and itinerant agitators
deplore those governments does not mean such
projects are undesirable. A world without war or
insurgency or counter-insurgency would be ideal,
but it is not an immediate prospect.
The question of classified (or "secret" or "war"
or "death") research on the campus is another straw
dummy. Classified proposals have been carefully
screened by a student-faculty committee for more
than a year. Project titles and descriptions have
been made publicly available, results have been
published with rare and minor exceptions, classifi
cation has generally been required for peripheral
reasons, and none of the work is connected with the
war. In fact, "war research" as Stanford has so little
to do with the Vietnam conflict that the Depart
ment of Defense has cut back in its funding of those
fundamental engineering studies.
SRI and Stanford
Long ago, the SDS began questioning the work
conducted by SRI and asked why such noxious
activities were associated with the university. The
ties between the two institutions were slight, and
the SDS could see no reason to continue the mar
riage.
During the six-month Scott committee study,
however, the SDS realized with alarm that the com
mittee majority was indeed prepared to recommend
divorce. In a brilliant reversal, the SDS then argued
that SRI should be retained and stripped of work
that did not meet SDS approval. As an alternative,
it might be sold and stripped of that work. In any
event, work of national importance would be ter
minated. Those who demanded the freedom to reg
ulate their own lives also demanded the freedom
to regulate the lives of 3000 persons at SRI.
So concerned was the SDS by the prospect of
divorce proceedings that a sit-in was called before

the Scott committee report was to be published,
before an announced faculty-student survey, and
before a May trustee committee hearing that had
been recommended on March 11. And, of course,
after the Trustee moratorium on new CBW work
at SRI.
Then followed the "peaceful" AEL sit-in, and
idealistic Stanford boys and girls fell all over them
selves rushing to join the fun. Peaceful sit-ins, inci
dentally, are the only kind that Stanford will tol
erate, so SDS leaders and others are careful to
sugar-coat their revolutions accordingly. "Let's
stroll down to the President's office to talk to him,"
"Join us in a symbolic gesture," "Sitting in at AEL
â€”wish you were here": and other such entreaties
are used to lure the unsuspecting into camp. The
terms are made most simple and attractive: you are
either against CBW or you are not, you are for
open meetings, or you are not. There is no middle
ground.
Appealing, too, is the high moral purpose (a
lesser evil to oppose a greater one), the clean-up
committees to sweep out afterward, the beautifully
democratic meetings and dramatic dialogue once
the sit-in is in progress and while the leaders are
getting the results they want. Little do the Stanford
students realize that they are only bodies, cleverly
maneuvered into place. Whether they are sweeping
or sleeping or debating makes no difference; they
are there. The report circles the world that many
students have seized a building in opposition to
United States policy.
Let a bona-fide challenge to the sit-in arise, how
ever, and the democratic process suddenly changes.
The chairmanship of the meeting switches; voting is
delayed until the opposition tires and departs;
voting is restricted to only those sitting in. In short,
popular votes are counted only when they meet the
needs of the movement; when they do not, they are
disregarded. Some 1600 student signatures show
"support of the sit-in," but voting is reserved for
"those who are with us."
The Pure Sit-in
But a sit-in is a sit-in, whether it is peaceful or
not. It is much like a slight pregnancy. Once one
embraces the notion that a minority can dictate
to the majority in a functioning democracy, without
willingness to pay the penalty, one is hard-pressed
to define the limits of such action. If only 150 people
in the AEL can be displaced today, why not 300
in Space Sciences tomorrow, 500 in the Business
School the next day, and 1000 in engineering the
day after? Or, as one dissident said, why not close
down the entire university "because what we are
doing is right"? How many times has that phrase
echoed in history? What are the practical limita
tions to such tyranny?
The idea that a few can dictate to the many if
only they can find the moral justification is at the
root of Stanford's problems in recent years. It has
softened judicial decisions, it has softened the heads
of many professors who should know better. It has
led to incredibly foolish and biased reporting in
the Daily, and has encouraged other students to
join the bandwagon of unquestioning moral com
mittment. Campus idealists, critical of men and
institutions to the point of near self-destruction,
have added to the cause. Let the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee schedule an appearance
in San Francisco, and letters of opposition are writ
ten and advertisements are endorsed; but when
200 puritans move into a remote electronics labora
tory little is said.

In short, the idea still persists that the "April
Third Movement" was a glorious, innocent mean
ingful crusade that simply brought to the fore some
topics that are needed to be discussed. Indeed they
were discussed, but the short-range gains will be
far exceeded by the long-range damage to Stanford
and to democracy. "We've lost our sense of com
munity since the Encina sit-in," students now moan.
If only we could recapture the good old days, when
we had all those speeches, all those votes, all those
TV cameras, and no fear of reprisal from the Uni
versity. We laid our bodies on the line until some
one started asking us our names. How heady it was
to send out teams to "liberate" documents, to ques
tion researchers in nearby labs to see if they were
doing acceptable work, to screen projects proposed
by AEL staffers. How exciting to open every locked
door, pry open every locked desk, and to "lose"
Ph.D. dissertations.
Why Encina?
If A3M members so deplore the move to Encina,
have they ever asked themselves why that action
was taken? Have they ever pondered the connec
tion between May 1 around the world and the
seizure of college buildings across the United
States? Between the absence of tanks in Red Square
on that day and the presence of American college
students protesting militarism? Between the photo
graphs of thousands of people in San Francisco
supporting Huey Newton or commemorating the
Haymarket riot of 1886 (as one leaflet claimed)
and the use of those photographs on the anniversary
of international communism?
Is this red-baiting or Bircherism, or are these
questions that should be quietly asked and consid
ered? Is it entirely coincidental that the list of de
mands in the AEL sit-in broadened mysteriously
from "ending CBW and death research" to the end
of counter-insurgency in Thailand and"the grad
ual elimination of all CBW, counterinsurgency,
economic development, ABM, and classified re
search and production on Stanford land?"
Who broadens these demands, and why? Did the
students sitting in at AEL know they were also pro
testing efforts to strengthen the economy (and ulti
mately to help "the people") in underdeveloped
countries?
There are a number of other points to be con
sidered. The dissidents have won a number of
victories this Spring, chiefly by stampeding groups
into making hasty decisions often influenced by the
motions generated by the dissidents. The CBW
moratorium is in effect. ROTC for credit has been
abandoned. Two million dollars in classified re
search is being phased out. New controls over
classified research have been set. There is merit in
some of those actions, but the question remains:
"Are there other beneficiaries, as well? Who else
gains if America's technological advantage is weak
ened, or its ability to help other nations defend
themselves is reduced"? A cynical observer might
conclude that that is precisely what campus con
frontations are achieving.
There are other points, as well. The University
has been kept from its full work for a Quarter or
more. Some of the most able students, faculty and
administrative minds have been caught up in non
productive efforts. A major institution has been
hamstrung, and the cream of the student body has
been poisoned. Multiply this by every great college
in the country, and the results are not inconsequen
tial.

Long ago, the SDS began questioning the work
conducted by SRI and asked why such noxious
activities were associated with the university. The
ties between the two institutions were slight, and
the SDS could see no reason to continue the mar
riage.
During the six-month Scott committee study,
however, the SDS realized with alarm that the com
mittee majority was indeed prepared to recommend
divorce. In a brilliant reversal, the SDS then argued
that SRI should be retained and stripped of work
that did not meet SDS approval. As an alternative,
it might be sold and stripped of that work. In any
event, work of national importance would be ter
minated. Those who demanded the freedom to reg
ulate their own lives also demanded the freedom
to regulate the lives of 3000 persons at SRI.
So concerned was the SDS by the prospect of
divorce proceedings that a sit-in was called before

the Scott committee report was to be published,
before an announced faculty-student survey, and
before a May trustee committee hearing that had
been recommended on March 11. And, of course,
after the Trustee moratorium on new CBW work
at SRI.
Then followed the "peaceful" AEL sit-in, and
idealistic Stanford boys and girls fell all over them
selves rushing to join the fun. Peaceful sit-ins, inci
dentally, are the only kind that Stanford will tol
erate, so SDS leaders and others are careful to
sugar-coat their revolutions accordingly. "Let's
stroll down to the President's office to talk to him,"
"Join us in a symbolic gesture," "Sitting in at AEL
â€”wish you were here": and other such entreaties
are used to lure the unsuspecting into camp. The
terms are made most simple and attractive: you are
either against CBW or you are not, you are for
open meetings, or you are not. There is no middle
ground.
Appealing, too, is the high moral purpose (a
lesser evil to oppose a greater one), the clean-up
committees to sweep out afterward, the beautifully
democratic meetings and dramatic dialogue once
the sit-in is in progress and while the leaders are
getting the results they want. Little do the Stanford
students realize that they are only bodies, cleverly
maneuvered into place. Whether they are sweeping
or sleeping or debating makes no difference; they
are there. The report circles the world that many
students have seized a building in opposition to
United States policy.
Let a bona-fide challenge to the sit-in arise, how
ever, and the democratic process suddenly changes.
The chairmanship of the meeting switches; voting is
delayed until the opposition tires and departs;
voting is restricted to only those sitting in. In short,
popular votes are counted only when they meet the
needs of the movement; when they do not, they are
disregarded. Some 1600 student signatures show
"support of the sit-in," but voting is reserved for
"those who are with us."
The Pure Sit-in
But a sit-in is a sit-in, whether it is peaceful or
not. It is much like a slight pregnancy. Once one
embraces the notion that a minority can dictate
to the majority in a functioning democracy, without
willingness to pay the penalty, one is hard-pressed
to define the limits of such action. If only 150 people
in the AEL can be displaced today, why not 300
in Space Sciences tomorrow, 500 in the Business
School the next day, and 1000 in engineering the
day after? Or, as one dissident said, why not close
down the entire university "because what we are
doing is right"? How many times has that phrase
echoed in history? What are the practical limita
tions to such tyranny?
The idea that a few can dictate to the many if
only they can find the moral justification is at the
root of Stanford's problems in recent years. It has
softened judicial decisions, it has softened the heads
of many professors who should know better. It has
led to incredibly foolish and biased reporting in
the Daily, and has encouraged other students to
join the bandwagon of unquestioning moral com
mittment. Campus idealists, critical of men and
institutions to the point of near self-destruction,
have added to the cause. Let the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee schedule an appearance
in San Francisco, and letters of opposition are writ
ten and advertisements are endorsed; but when
200 puritans move into a remote electronics labora
tory little is said.

In short, the idea still persists that the "April
Third Movement" was a glorious, innocent mean
ingful crusade that simply brought to the fore some
topics that are needed to be discussed. Indeed they
were discussed, but the short-range gains will be
far exceeded by the long-range damage to Stanford
and to democracy. "We've lost our sense of com
munity since the Encina sit-in," students now moan.
If only we could recapture the good old days, when
we had all those speeches, all those votes, all those
TV cameras, and no fear of reprisal from the Uni
versity. We laid our bodies on the line until some
one started asking us our names. How heady it was
to send out teams to "liberate" documents, to ques
tion researchers in nearby labs to see if they were
doing acceptable work, to screen projects proposed
by AEL staffers. How exciting to open every locked
door, pry open every locked desk, and to "lose"
Ph.D. dissertations.
Why Encina?
If A3M members so deplore the move to Encina,
have they ever asked themselves why that action
was taken? Have they ever pondered the connec
tion between May 1 around the world and the
seizure of college buildings across the United
States? Between the absence of tanks in Red Square
on that day and the presence of American college
students protesting militarism? Between the photo
graphs of thousands of people in San Francisco
supporting Huey Newton or commemorating the
Haymarket riot of 1886 (as one leaflet claimed)
and the use of those photographs on the anniversary
of international communism?
Is this red-baiting or Bircherism, or are these
questions that should be quietly asked and consid
ered? Is it entirely coincidental that the list of de
mands in the AEL sit-in broadened mysteriously
from "ending CBW and death research" to the end
of counter-insurgency in Thailand and"the grad
ual elimination of all CBW, counterinsurgency,
economic development, ABM, and classified re
search and production on Stanford land?"
Who broadens these demands, and why? Did the
students sitting in at AEL know they were also pro
testing efforts to strengthen the economy (and ulti
mately to help "the people") in underdeveloped
countries?
There are a number of other points to be con
sidered. The dissidents have won a number of
victories this Spring, chiefly by stampeding groups
into making hasty decisions often influenced by the
motions generated by the dissidents. The CBW
moratorium is in effect. ROTC for credit has been
abandoned. Two million dollars in classified re
search is being phased out. New controls over
classified research have been set. There is merit in
some of those actions, but the question remains:
"Are there other beneficiaries, as well? Who else
gains if America's technological advantage is weak
ened, or its ability to help other nations defend
themselves is reduced"? A cynical observer might
conclude that that is precisely what campus con
frontations are achieving.
There are other points, as well. The University
has been kept from its full work for a Quarter or
more. Some of the most able students, faculty and
administrative minds have been caught up in non
productive efforts. A major institution has been
hamstrung, and the cream of the student body has
been poisoned. Multiply this by every great college
in the country, and the results are not inconsequen
tial.
During the brief respite that the SDS and allied
groups have allowed us prior to whatever student
strikes or other "symbolic gestures" they can manu
facture before Dead Week, it is appropriate to ex
amine what has happened to Stanford in the past
month, and to ask some questions about those
events.
Such a review should be valuable to the entire
campus community, for Stanford and the demo
cratic process have been deeply imperiled by the
seemingly noble and innocent April Third Move
ment.
The "Issues"
First, the "issues" in the matter: chemical, bio
logical and radiological research and counter
insurgency work at SRI, and "death research" on
the campus. What real validity did they have?
Precious little. There is no biological warfare re
search at SRI, nor any radiological work of that
nature. There are two unclassified projects with a
current backlog equivalent to the efforts of one man
for one year. One ends in July and deals with
particle-size distribution of powders that will not
dissolve in water. The second is a basic study of
enzyme production leading to the possible develop
ment of systems for detecting bacteriological agents
which might be deployed against this country. It
runs until next year. Furthermore, on April 8, before
the AEL sit-in, the Board of Trustees asked SRI
not to accept any further CBW work pending com
pletion of the study of Stanford-SRI relations.
As for counter-insurgency work, SRI is engaged
in efforts to support existing governments. But the
question must be asked: Why not? Simply because
the resident campus Maoist and itinerant agitators
deplore those governments does not mean such
projects are undesirable. A world without war or
insurgency or counter-insurgency would be ideal,
but it is not an immediate prospect.
The question of classified (or "secret" or "war"
or "death") research on the campus is another straw
dummy. Classified proposals have been carefully
screened by a student-faculty committee for more
than a year. Project titles and descriptions have
been made publicly available, results have been
published with rare and minor exceptions, classifi
cation has generally been required for peripheral
reasons, and none of the work is connected with the
war. In fact, "war research" as Stanford has so little
to do with the Vietnam conflict that the Depart
ment of Defense has cut back in its funding of those
fundamental engineering studies.

Let a bona-fide challenge to the sit-in arise, how
ever, and the democratic process suddenly changes.
The chairmanship of the meeting switches; voting is
delayed until the opposition tires and departs;
voting is restricted to only those sitting in. In short,
popular votes are counted only when they meet the
needs of the movement; when they do not, they are
disregarded. Some 1600 student signatures show
"support of the sit-in," but voting is reserved for
"those who are with us."
The Pure Sit-in
But a sit-in is a sit-in, whether it is peaceful or
not. It is much like a slight pregnancy. Once one
embraces the notion that a minority can dictate
to the majority in a functioning democracy, without
willingness to pay the penalty, one is hard-pressed
to define the limits of such action. If only 150 people
in the AEL can be displaced today, why not 300
in Space Sciences tomorrow, 500 in the Business
School the next day, and 1000 in engineering the
day after? Or, as one dissident said, why not close
down the entire university "because what we are
doing is right"? How many times has that phrase
echoed in history? What are the practical limita
tions to such tyranny?
The idea that a few can dictate to the many if
only they can find the moral justification is at the
root of Stanford's problems in recent years. It has
softened judicial decisions, it has softened the heads
of many professors who should know better. It has
led to incredibly foolish and biased reporting in
the Daily, and has encouraged other students to
join the bandwagon of unquestioning moral com
mittment. Campus idealists, critical of men and
institutions to the point of near self-destruction,
have added to the cause. Let the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee schedule an appearance
in San Francisco, and letters of opposition are writ
ten and advertisements are endorsed; but when
200 puritans move into a remote electronics labora
tory little is said.

In short, the idea still persists that the "April
Third Movement" was a glorious, innocent mean
ingful crusade that simply brought to the fore some
topics that are needed to be discussed. Indeed they
were discussed, but the short-range gains will be
far exceeded by the long-range damage to Stanford
and to democracy. "We've lost our sense of com
munity since the Encina sit-in," students now moan.
If only we could recapture the good old days, when
we had all those speeches, all those votes, all those
TV cameras, and no fear of reprisal from the Uni
versity. We laid our bodies on the line until some
one started asking us our names. How heady it was
to send out teams to "liberate" documents, to ques
tion researchers in nearby labs to see if they were
doing acceptable work, to screen projects proposed
by AEL staffers. How exciting to open every locked
door, pry open every locked desk, and to "lose"
Ph.D. dissertations.
Why Encina?
If A3M members so deplore the move to Encina,
have they ever asked themselves why that action
was taken? Have they ever pondered the connec
tion between May 1 around the world and the
seizure of college buildings across the United
States? Between the absence of tanks in Red Square
on that day and the presence of American college
students protesting militarism? Between the photo
graphs of thousands of people in San Francisco
supporting Huey Newton or commemorating the
Haymarket riot of 1886 (as one leaflet claimed)
and the use of those photographs on the anniversary
of international communism?
Is this red-baiting or Bircherism, or are these
questions that should be quietly asked and consid
ered? Is it entirely coincidental that the list of de
mands in the AEL sit-in broadened mysteriously
from "ending CBW and death research" to the end
of counter-insurgency in Thailand and"the grad
ual elimination of all CBW, counterinsurgency,
economic development, ABM, and classified re
search and production on Stanford land?"
Who broadens these demands, and why? Did the
students sitting in at AEL know they were also pro
testing efforts to strengthen the economy (and ulti
mately to help "the people") in underdeveloped
countries?
There are a number of other points to be con
sidered. The dissidents have won a number of
victories this Spring, chiefly by stampeding groups
into making hasty decisions often influenced by the
motions generated by the dissidents. The CBW
moratorium is in effect. ROTC for credit has been
abandoned. Two million dollars in classified re
search is being phased out. New controls over
classified research have been set. There is merit in
some of those actions, but the question remains:
"Are there other beneficiaries, as well? Who else
gains if America's technological advantage is weak
ened, or its ability to help other nations defend
themselves is reduced"? A cynical observer might
conclude that that is precisely what campus con
frontations are achieving.
There are other points, as well. The University
has been kept from its full work for a Quarter or
more. Some of the most able students, faculty and
administrative minds have been caught up in non
productive efforts. A major institution has been
hamstrung, and the cream of the student body has
been poisoned. Multiply this by every great college
in the country, and the results are not inconsequen
tial.
During the brief respite that the SDS and allied
groups have allowed us prior to whatever student
strikes or other "symbolic gestures" they can manu
facture before Dead Week, it is appropriate to ex
amine what has happened to Stanford in the past
month, and to ask some questions about those
events.
Such a review should be valuable to the entire
campus community, for Stanford and the demo
cratic process have been deeply imperiled by the
seemingly noble and innocent April Third Move
ment.
The "Issues"
First, the "issues" in the matter: chemical, bio
logical and radiological research and counter
insurgency work at SRI, and "death research" on
the campus. What real validity did they have?
Precious little. There is no biological warfare re
search at SRI, nor any radiological work of that
nature. There are two unclassified projects with a
current backlog equivalent to the efforts of one man
for one year. One ends in July and deals with
particle-size distribution of powders that will not
dissolve in water. The second is a basic study of
enzyme production leading to the possible develop
ment of systems for detecting bacteriological agents
which might be deployed against this country. It
runs until next year. Furthermore, on April 8, before
the AEL sit-in, the Board of Trustees asked SRI
not to accept any further CBW work pending com
pletion of the study of Stanford-SRI relations.
As for counter-insurgency work, SRI is engaged
in efforts to support existing governments. But the
question must be asked: Why not? Simply because
the resident campus Maoist and itinerant agitators
deplore those governments does not mean such
projects are undesirable. A world without war or
insurgency or counter-insurgency would be ideal,
but it is not an immediate prospect.
The question of classified (or "secret" or "war"
or "death") research on the campus is another straw
dummy. Classified proposals have been carefully
screened by a student-faculty committee for more
than a year. Project titles and descriptions have
been made publicly available, results have been
published with rare and minor exceptions, classifi
cation has generally been required for peripheral
reasons, and none of the work is connected with the
war. In fact, "war research" as Stanford has so little
to do with the Vietnam conflict that the Depart
ment of Defense has cut back in its funding of those
fundamental engineering studies.
SRI and Stanford
Long ago, the SDS began questioning the work
conducted by SRI and asked why such noxious
activities were associated with the university. The
ties between the two institutions were slight, and
the SDS could see no reason to continue the mar
riage.
During the six-month Scott committee study,
however, the SDS realized with alarm that the com
mittee majority was indeed prepared to recommend
divorce. In a brilliant reversal, the SDS then argued
that SRI should be retained and stripped of work
that did not meet SDS approval. As an alternative,
it might be sold and stripped of that work. In any
event, work of national importance would be ter
minated. Those who demanded the freedom to reg
ulate their own lives also demanded the freedom
to regulate the lives of 3000 persons at SRI.
So concerned was the SDS by the prospect of
divorce proceedings that a sit-in was called before

the Scott committee report was to be published,
before an announced faculty-student survey, and
before a May trustee committee hearing that had
been recommended on March 11. And, of course,
after the Trustee moratorium on new CBW work
at SRI.
Then followed the "peaceful" AEL sit-in, and
idealistic Stanford boys and girls fell all over them
selves rushing to join the fun. Peaceful sit-ins, inci
dentally, are the only kind that Stanford will tol
erate, so SDS leaders and others are careful to
sugar-coat their revolutions accordingly. "Let's
stroll down to the President's office to talk to him,"
"Join us in a symbolic gesture," "Sitting in at AEL
â€”wish you were here": and other such entreaties
are used to lure the unsuspecting into camp. The
terms are made most simple and attractive: you are
either against CBW or you are not, you are for
open meetings, or you are not. There is no middle
ground.
Appealing, too, is the high moral purpose (a
lesser evil to oppose a greater one), the clean-up
committees to sweep out afterward, the beautifully
democratic meetings and dramatic dialogue once
the sit-in is in progress and while the leaders are
getting the results they want. Little do the Stanford
students realize that they are only bodies, cleverly
maneuvered into place. Whether they are sweeping
or sleeping or debating makes no difference; they
are there. The report circles the world that many
students have seized a building in opposition to
United States policy.
Let a bona-fide challenge to the sit-in arise, how
ever, and the democratic process suddenly changes.
The chairmanship of the meeting switches; voting is

munity since the Encina sit-in," students now moan.
If only we could recapture the good old days, when
we had all those speeches, all those votes, all those
TV cameras, and no fear of reprisal from the Uni
versity. We laid our bodies on the line until some
one started asking us our names. How heady it was
to send out teams to "liberate" documents, to ques
tion researchers in nearby labs to see if they were
doing acceptable work, to screen projects proposed
by AEL staffers. How exciting to open every locked
door, pry open every locked desk, and to "lose"
Ph.D. dissertations.
Why Encina?
If A3M members so deplore the move to Encina,
have they ever asked themselves why that action
was taken? Have they ever pondered the connec
tion between May 1 around the world and the
seizure of college buildings across the United
States? Between the absence of tanks in Red Square
on that day and the presence of American college
students protesting militarism? Between the photo
graphs of thousands of people in San Francisco
supporting Huey Newton or commemorating the
Haymarket riot of 1886 (as one leaflet claimed)
and the use of those photographs on the anniversary
of international communism?
Is this red-baiting or Bircherism, or are these
questions that should be quietly asked and consid
ered? Is it entirely coincidental that the list of de
mands in the AEL sit-in broadened mysteriously
from "ending CBW and death research" to the end
of counter-insurgency in Thailand and"the grad
ual elimination of all CBW, counterinsurgency,
economic development, ABM, and classified re
search and production on Stanford land?"
Who broadens these demands, and why? Did the
students sitting in at AEL know they were also pro
testing efforts to strengthen the economy (and ulti
mately to help "the people") in underdeveloped
countries?
There are a number of other points to be con
sidered. The dissidents have won a number of
victories this Spring, chiefly by stampeding groups
into making hasty decisions often influenced by the
motions generated by the dissidents. The CBW
moratorium is in effect. ROTC for credit has been
abandoned. Two million dollars in classified re
search is being phased out. New controls over
classified research have been set. There is merit in
some of those actions, but the question remains:
"Are there other beneficiaries, as well? Who else
gains if America's technological advantage is weak
ened, or its ability to help other nations defend
themselves is reduced"? A cynical observer might
conclude that that is precisely what campus con
frontations are achieving.
There are other points, as well. The University
has been kept from its full work for a Quarter or
more. Some of the most able students, faculty and
administrative minds have been caught up in non
productive efforts. A major institution has been
hamstrung, and the cream of the student body has
been poisoned. Multiply this by every great college
in the country, and the results are not inconsequen
tial.
During the brief respite that the SDS and allied
groups have allowed us prior to whatever student
strikes or other "symbolic gestures" they can manu
facture before Dead Week, it is appropriate to ex
amine what has happened to Stanford in the past
month, and to ask some questions about those
events.
Such a review should be valuable to the entire
campus community, for Stanford and the demo
cratic process have been deeply imperiled by the
seemingly noble and innocent April Third Move
ment.
The "Issues"
First, the "issues" in the matter: chemical, bio
logical and radiological research and counter
insurgency work at SRI, and "death research" on
the campus. What real validity did they have?
Precious little. There is no biological warfare re
search at SRI, nor any radiological work of that
nature. There are two unclassified projects with a
current backlog equivalent to the efforts of one man
for one year. One ends in July and deals with
particle-size distribution of powders that will not
dissolve in water. The second is a basic study of
enzyme production leading to the possible develop
ment of systems for detecting bacteriological agents
which might be deployed against this country. It
runs until next year. Furthermore, on April 8, before
the AEL sit-in, the Board of Trustees asked SRI
not to accept any further CBW work pending com
pletion of the study of Stanford-SRI relations.
As for counter-insurgency work, SRI is engaged
in efforts to support existing governments. But the
question must be asked: Why not? Simply because
the resident campus Maoist and itinerant agitators
deplore those governments does not mean such
projects are undesirable. A world without war or
insurgency or counter-insurgency would be ideal,
but it is not an immediate prospect.
The question of classified (or "secret" or "war"
or "death") research on the campus is another straw
dummy. Classified proposals have been carefully
screened by a student-faculty committee for more
than a year. Project titles and descriptions have
been made publicly available, results have been
published with rare and minor exceptions, classifi
cation has generally been required for peripheral
reasons, and none of the work is connected with the
war. In fact, "war research" as Stanford has so little
to do with the Vietnam conflict that the Depart
ment of Defense has cut back in its funding of those
fundamental engineering studies.
SRI and Stanford
Long ago, the SDS began questioning the work
conducted by SRI and asked why such noxious
activities were associated with the university. The
ties between the two institutions were slight, and
the SDS could see no reason to continue the mar
riage.
During the six-month Scott committee study,
however, the SDS realized with alarm that the com
mittee majority was indeed prepared to recommend
divorce. In a brilliant reversal, the SDS then argued
that SRI should be retained and stripped of work
that did not meet SDS approval. As an alternative,
it might be sold and stripped of that work. In any
event, work of national importance would be ter
minated. Those who demanded the freedom to reg
ulate their own lives also demanded the freedom
to regulate the lives of 3000 persons at SRI.
So concerned was the SDS by the prospect of
divorce proceedings that a sit-in was called before

the Scott committee report was to be published,
before an announced faculty-student survey, and
before a May trustee committee hearing that had
been recommended on March 11. And, of course,
after the Trustee moratorium on new CBW work
at SRI.
Then followed the "peaceful" AEL sit-in, and
idealistic Stanford boys and girls fell all over them
selves rushing to join the fun. Peaceful sit-ins, inci
dentally, are the only kind that Stanford will tol
erate, so SDS leaders and others are careful to
sugar-coat their revolutions accordingly. "Let's
stroll down to the President's office to talk to him,"
"Join us in a symbolic gesture," "Sitting in at AEL
â€”wish you were here": and other such entreaties
are used to lure the unsuspecting into camp. The
terms are made most simple and attractive: you are
either against CBW or you are not, you are for
open meetings, or you are not. There is no middle
ground.
Appealing, too, is the high moral purpose (a
lesser evil to oppose a greater one), the clean-up
committees to sweep out afterward, the beautifully
democratic meetings and dramatic dialogue once
the sit-in is in progress and while the leaders are
getting the results they want. Little do the Stanford
students realize that they are only bodies, cleverly
maneuvered into place. Whether they are sweeping
or sleeping or debating makes no difference; they
are there. The report circles the world that many
students have seized a building in opposition to
United States policy.
Let a bona-fide challenge to the sit-in arise, how
ever, and the democratic process suddenly changes.
The chairmanship of the meeting switches; voting is
delayed until the opposition tires and departs;
voting is restricted to only those sitting in. In short,
popular votes are counted only when they meet the
needs of the movement; when they do not, they are
disregarded. Some 1600 student signatures show
"support of the sit-in," but voting is reserved for
"those who are with us."
The Pure Sit-in
But a sit-in is a sit-in, whether it is peaceful or
not. It is much like a slight pregnancy. Once one
embraces the notion that a minority can dictate
to the majority in a functioning democracy, without
willingness to pay the penalty, one is hard-pressed
to define the limits of such action. If only 150 people
in the AEL can be displaced today, why not 300
in Space Sciences tomorrow, 500 in the Business
School the next day, and 1000 in engineering the
day after? Or, as one dissident said, why not close
down the entire university "because what we are
doing is right"? How many times has that phrase
echoed in history? What are the practical limita
tions to such tyranny?
The idea that a few can dictate to the many if
only they can find the moral justification is at the
root of Stanford's problems in recent years. It has
softened judicial decisions, it has softened the heads
of many professors who should know better. It has
led to incredibly foolish and biased reporting in
the Daily, and has encouraged other students to
join the bandwagon of unquestioning moral com
mittment. Campus idealists, critical of men and
institutions to the point of near self-destruction,
have added to the cause. Let the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee schedule an appearance
in San Francisco, and letters of opposition are writ
ten and advertisements are endorsed; but when
200 puritans move into a remote electronics labora
tory little is said.

In short, the idea still persists that the "April
Third Movement" was a glorious, innocent mean
ingful crusade that simply brought to the fore some
topics that are needed to be discussed. Indeed they
were discussed, but the short-range gains will be
far exceeded by the long-range damage to Stanford
and to democracy. "We've lost our sense of com
munity since the Encina sit-in," students now moan.
If only we could recapture the good old days, when
we had all those speeches, all those votes, all those

some of those actions, but the question remains:
"Are there other beneficiaries, as well? Who else
gains if America's technological advantage is weak
ened, or its ability to help other nations defend
themselves is reduced"? A cynical observer might
conclude that that is precisely what campus con
frontations are achieving.
There are other points, as well. The University
has been kept from its full work for a Quarter or
more. Some of the most able students, faculty and
administrative minds have been caught up in non
productive efforts. A major institution has been
hamstrung, and the cream of the student body has
been poisoned. Multiply this by every great college
in the country, and the results are not inconsequen
tial.
During the brief respite that the SDS and allied
groups have allowed us prior to whatever student
strikes or other "symbolic gestures" they can manu
facture before Dead Week, it is appropriate to ex
amine what has happened to Stanford in the past
month, and to ask some questions about those
events.
Such a review should be valuable to the entire
campus community, for Stanford and the demo
cratic process have been deeply imperiled by the
seemingly noble and innocent April Third Move
ment.
The "Issues"
First, the "issues" in the matter: chemical, bio
logical and radiological research and counter
insurgency work at SRI, and "death research" on
the campus. What real validity did they have?
Precious little. There is no biological warfare re
search at SRI, nor any radiological work of that
nature. There are two unclassified projects with a
current backlog equivalent to the efforts of one man
for one year. One ends in July and deals with
particle-size distribution of powders that will not
dissolve in water. The second is a basic study of
enzyme production leading to the possible develop
ment of systems for detecting bacteriological agents
which might be deployed against this country. It
runs until next year. Furthermore, on April 8, before
the AEL sit-in, the Board of Trustees asked SRI
not to accept any further CBW work pending com
pletion of the study of Stanford-SRI relations.
As for counter-insurgency work, SRI is engaged
in efforts to support existing governments. But the
question must be asked: Why not? Simply because
the resident campus Maoist and itinerant agitators
deplore those governments does not mean such
projects are undesirable. A world without war or
insurgency or counter-insurgency would be ideal,
but it is not an immediate prospect.
The question of classified (or "secret" or "war"
or "death") research on the campus is another straw
dummy. Classified proposals have been carefully
screened by a student-faculty committee for more
than a year. Project titles and descriptions have
been made publicly available, results have been
published with rare and minor exceptions, classifi
cation has generally been required for peripheral
reasons, and none of the work is connected with the
war. In fact, "war research" as Stanford has so little
to do with the Vietnam conflict that the Depart
ment of Defense has cut back in its funding of those
fundamental engineering studies.
SRI and Stanford
Long ago, the SDS began questioning the work
conducted by SRI and asked why such noxious
activities were associated with the university. The
ties between the two institutions were slight, and
the SDS could see no reason to continue the mar
riage.
During the six-month Scott committee study,
however, the SDS realized with alarm that the com
mittee majority was indeed prepared to recommend
divorce. In a brilliant reversal, the SDS then argued
that SRI should be retained and stripped of work
that did not meet SDS approval. As an alternative,
it might be sold and stripped of that work. In any
event, work of national importance would be ter
minated. Those who demanded the freedom to reg
ulate their own lives also demanded the freedom
to regulate the lives of 3000 persons at SRI.
So concerned was the SDS by the prospect of
divorce proceedings that a sit-in was called before

the Scott committee report was to be published,
before an announced faculty-student survey, and
before a May trustee committee hearing that had
been recommended on March 11. And, of course,
after the Trustee moratorium on new CBW work
at SRI.
Then followed the "peaceful" AEL sit-in, and
idealistic Stanford boys and girls fell all over them
selves rushing to join the fun. Peaceful sit-ins, inci
dentally, are the only kind that Stanford will tol
erate, so SDS leaders and others are careful to
sugar-coat their revolutions accordingly. "Let's
stroll down to the President's office to talk to him,"
"Join us in a symbolic gesture," "Sitting in at AEL
â€”wish you were here": and other such entreaties
are used to lure the unsuspecting into camp. The
terms are made most simple and attractive: you are
either against CBW or you are not, you are for
open meetings, or you are not. There is no middle
ground.
Appealing, too, is the high moral purpose (a
lesser evil to oppose a greater one), the clean-up
committees to sweep out afterward, the beautifully
democratic meetings and dramatic dialogue once
the sit-in is in progress and while the leaders are
getting the results they want. Little do the Stanford
students realize that they are only bodies, cleverly
maneuvered into place. Whether they are sweeping
or sleeping or debating makes no difference; they
are there. The report circles the world that many
students have seized a building in opposition to
United States policy.
Let a bona-fide challenge to the sit-in arise, how
ever, and the democratic process suddenly changes.
The chairmanship of the meeting switches; voting is
delayed until the opposition tires and departs;
voting is restricted to only those sitting in. In short,
popular votes are counted only when they meet the
needs of the movement; when they do not, they are
disregarded. Some 1600 student signatures show
"support of the sit-in," but voting is reserved for
"those who are with us."
The Pure Sit-in
But a sit-in is a sit-in, whether it is peaceful or
not. It is much like a slight pregnancy. Once one
embraces the notion that a minority can dictate
to the majority in a functioning democracy, without
willingness to pay the penalty, one is hard-pressed
to define the limits of such action. If only 150 people
in the AEL can be displaced today, why not 300
in Space Sciences tomorrow, 500 in the Business
School the next day, and 1000 in engineering the
day after? Or, as one dissident said, why not close
down the entire university "because what we are
doing is right"? How many times has that phrase
echoed in history? What are the practical limita
tions to such tyranny?
The idea that a few can dictate to the many if
only they can find the moral justification is at the
root of Stanford's problems in recent years. It has
softened judicial decisions, it has softened the heads
of many professors who should know better. It has
led to incredibly foolish and biased reporting in
the Daily, and has encouraged other students to
join the bandwagon of unquestioning moral com
mittment. Campus idealists, critical of men and
institutions to the point of near self-destruction,
have added to the cause. Let the House Un-Ameri
can Activities Committee schedule an appearance
in San Francisco, and letters of opposition are writ
ten and advertisements are endorsed; but when
200 puritans move into a remote electronics labora
tory little is said.

In short, the idea still persists that the "April
Third Movement" was a glorious, innocent mean
ingful crusade that simply brought to the fore some
topics that are needed to be discussed. Indeed they
were discussed, but the short-range gains will be
far exceeded by the long-range damage to Stanford
and to democracy. "We've lost our sense of com
munity since the Encina sit-in," students now moan.
If only we could recapture the good old days, when
we had all those speeches, all those votes, all those
TV cameras, and no fear of reprisal from the Uni
versity. We laid our bodies on the line until some
one started asking us our names. How heady it was
to send out teams to "liberate" documents, to ques
tion researchers in nearby labs to see if they were
doing acceptable work, to screen projects proposed
by AEL staffers. How exciting to open every locked
door, pry open every locked desk, and to "lose"
Ph.D. dissertations.
Why Encina?
If A3M members so deplore the move to Encina,
have they ever asked themselves why that action
was taken? Have they ever pondered the connec
tion between May 1 around the world and the
seizure of college buildings across the United
States? Between the absence of tanks in Red Square
on that day and the presence of American college
students protesting militarism? Between the photo
graphs of thousands of people in San Francisco
supporting Huey Newton or commemorating the
Haymarket riot of 1886 (as one leaflet claimed)
and the use of those photographs on the anniversary
of international communism?
Is this red-baiting or Bircherism, or are these
questions that should be quietly asked and consid
ered? Is it entirely coincidental that the list of de
mands in the AEL sit-in broadened mysteriously
from "ending CBW and death research" to the end
of counter-insurgency in Thailand and"the grad
ual elimination of all CBW, counterinsurgency,
economic development, ABM, and classified re
search and production on Stanford land?"
Who broadens these demands, and why? Did the
students sitting in at AEL know they were also pro
testing efforts to strengthen the economy (and ulti
mately to help "the people") in underdeveloped
countries?
There are a number of other points to be con
sidered. The dissidents have won a number of
victories this Spring, chiefly by stampeding groups
into making hasty decisions often influenced by the
motions generated by the dissidents. The CBW
moratorium is in effect. ROTC for credit has been
abandoned. Two million dollars in classified re
search is being phased out. New controls over
classified research have been set. There is merit in
some of those actions, but the question remains:
"Are there other beneficiaries, as well? Who else
gains if America's technological advantage is weak
ened, or its ability to help other nations defend
themselves is reduced"? A cynical observer might
conclude that that is precisely what campus con
frontations are achieving.
There are other points, as well. The University
