# Hewlett Threatened, Comments On Militants
## 
### BROOKE SHEARER HILL FREIVOGEL 
Trustee William Hewlett,
according to the San Jose Mercury,
has received two death threats in the
past few weeks. The warnings
induced him to comment rather
skeptically about the traits of
student militants.
SRI President Charles Anderson,
was also busy over the week-end
criticizing the actions of Stanford
students. In an interview with Lance
Gilmore in the Sunday Examiner
issue, he said that the distorted
attacks on SRI have caused
"considerable anxiety that our work
might be supervised in some
fashion."
Threats Grow
The threats on Hewlett came after
the disputes over war research which
led to the Applied Electronics
Laboratory (AEL)and Encina sit-ins.
The first threat, Hewlett said, in a
interview with the Mercury's Pete
Carey, "bothered me a little, but it
doesn't any more."
The second threat followed the
police break-up of the Encina
occupation. According to executive
Hewlett, the voice threatened that
"next time we will have shotguns." A
later call was more direct. "The
caller," Hewlett explained, "declared
'You are a dead man,' then he hung
up."
There is- no evidence who made
warnings.

In editorializing about the threats,
and more generally about campus
militants, Hewlett said, "In many
ways these militants are not very far
from the fascists. They are just like
the Ku Klux Klan and the Nazis and
are using the same tactics."
Hewlett, business partner of
Assistant Secretary of Defense David
Packard, maintains the militants are
concentrating on him, rather than
the other members of the Board of
Trustees. He ascribes this emphasis to
his association with liberal corporate
projects.
Liberal Target
He said, "it is a stated tactic of
the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) that you go after the
liberal company, so we are
apparently a special target."
Hewlett described the disruptions
as the results of "a very small, hard
core militant group not desirous of
reaching solutions." He said this
group manipulates larger groups with
sincere concerns.
He also criticized the faculty's
decision to strip ROTC of academic
credit.
He was especially skeptical of the
faculty's motivation in making the
decision. "There is a lot of hypocrisy
in this. A lot of people say they are
doing it for moral reasons, but really
they are doing it for political reasons.
If you press them, they admit it. Hut
their arguments are clotheil in
morality."
