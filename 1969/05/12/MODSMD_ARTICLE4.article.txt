# No Senate Resolution On Counterinsurgency
## 
### 
liy MICHAEL SWEENEY
The Academic Senate narrowly
defeated two final attempts to pass a
resolution against SRl's
counterinsurgency at its meeting last
Thursday, the last before the pivotal
Trustees' meeting tomorrow.
Proposed resolutions on
counterinsurgency had come up
twice before. Now, in the opinion of
several Senate members, the chances
are slight that the Senate will take
any action on counterinsurgency.
At Thursday's meeting, Professors
Philip Dawson and Donald Kennedy
introduced a resolution which
declared it "inappropriate" for SRI
to "undertake investigations that are
intended by the sponsor specifically
to assist efforts and operations by
governments of other countries to
suppress groups of their citizens by
armed force or to provide military
aid to one side in a civil war in a
foreign country."
The Dawson-Kennedy resolution
''urged" that the Trustees
"encourage" SRI researchers to
"identify and terminate" such
research. This resolution, along with
a substitute motion, was tabled by a
25-1 9 vote.
Near the end of the meeting, Prof.
William Clebsch suggested a revised
resolution which did not declare a
general principle against
counterinsurgency, but instead called
it open to question whether it was

appropriate. A motion to suspend
the rules to consider this resolution
was favored by 18-17, but needed a
two-thirds majority to win.
Senate members offered several
reasons for the defeat, including
uneasiness over the definition of
counterinsurgency. Another reason
was said to be the inconsistency
between asking SRI professionals to
run their own affairs, in a resolution
April 29, and then giving them
specific advice on counterinsurgency.
