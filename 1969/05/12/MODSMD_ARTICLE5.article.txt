## 
### 
By MICHAEL KUHL
Over one-third of the Student
Legislature members have requested a
meeting of the body tonight, but
LASSU Speaker Yale Braunstein vows
the group will not meet until Thursday
night at 7:30 in room 320 on geology
corner.
Approximately 6 5 Legislature
members requested the special session
to deal with a nmber of bills,
resolutions, and by-law changes. The
initiators of the petition insist that no
discussion concerning the current class
boycott is slated for consideration.
"There can't be a meeting under the
by-laws," Braunstein insisted last night.
He claims that he did not receive notice
of new business to be considered by
5:30 yesterday afternoon.

The proposed agenda for tonight
includes opening of nominations for
three positions on the Commitee on
Nominations, consideration of a
resolution concerning the Academic
Senate's "Statement of Community
Responsibility," and consideration of
charges concerning the Student Conduct
Legislative Council (SCLC) election.
Tonight's agenda also proposes to set
a calendar for deliberation of the
budget. The finance committee is
scheduled to meet tonight and
tomorrow night and Braunstein intends
to bring the issue up at Thursday's
LASSU meeting.
Braunstein doubts that he will be
present at tonight's meeting, in which
case the Mason officer, Michael
Weinstein, is supposed to preside.
