# 400 Not Placed By Housing Draw

By MARGIE WOLF
Round one of the housing draw has
left more than 400 campus residents
temporarily out in the cold.
According to Associate Dean of
Students Bob Rosch, 150 to 200 of
these will still not be placed in campus
housing during round two and
adjustments over the summer.
Spaces have also not yet been
allocated in response to the campus
referendum asking that all foreign
graduate students be guaranteed housing
on or off campus. Associate Dean of
Students Sally Mahoney explained that
a number of space needs—for transfer
students, those in the draw, and foreign
graduate students—had not been filled.
She said these requirements could be
met after the draw.
Barry Askinas, member of the
Council of Presidents, commented, "I
am not optimistic about getting spaces
for foreign and transfer students in the
present residence system. 1 am
disappointed in the refusal of the Dean
of Students office to implement the
student body's request to make such
spaces available. It is unrealistic for
Dean Mahoney to imply that anything

can be done after students in the draw
have received notice that they do have a
space."
If the Board of Trustees approves
plans for temporary housing —trailers,
perhaps equipped with kitchens—spaces
may be found for students who would
otherwise be evicted from campus
housing.
Official Notification
Some 1900 people entered the draw.
On May 20 they will receive notice of
their housing assignment at the end of
round one. They must decide by May
23 whether to accept this choice or
enter round two of the draw.
Miss Mahoney said students moving
off campus and into fraternities are
expected to free spaces for now
unassigned applicants. Last year only 25
people were ultimately excluded from
campus housing compared with the
150-200 evictions predicted this year.
Students unassigned at the end of
round two are placed on waiting lists for
their residence choices. Miss Mahoney
said draw records will be kept on file in
the computer this year to ensure the fair
allotment of spaces as they become
available.
