# SCLC Chairman Reacts
## Suspension Controversy 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The legal right of the President to
suspend students without a hearing is
under attack by the student members of
the Student Conduct Legialative
Council (SCLC). The faculty Chairman
of SCLC has responded with an attack
on a statement by the five student
members.
SCLC, the student-faculty body
charged with promulgating rules for

student conduct, has eleven members,
six faculty and five students.
In a column in today's Daily (see
page 3) SCLC member law student
Richard Such and fellow law student
Bill Cozad claim that an amendment to
the Founding Grant of the University
prohibits the University President from
taking disciplinary action against
students without a hearing.
The amendment, added by Mrs.
Stanford in 1902, states, "It shall be the
duty of the Board of Trustees to make
general laws providing for the
government of the University, and to
provide for just and equitable rules of
discipline." The amendment was
enacted after then President David Starr
Jordan had suspended, without a
hearing, some students.
Encina No Emergency
The column further states that even
if the President does have emergency
power to take disciplinary action against
students, the occupation of Encina Hall
did not constitute such an emergency
situation.
In addition, the five student
members of SCLC have made a
statement attacking the recent
suspensions as "academic punishment
for political activity . .
In Friday's edition, THE DAILY
mistakenly attributed the statement by
the student members of SCLC as being a
statement by the entire Council. It was
not. The statement should have ben
attributed to the five student SCLC
members. THE DAILY rcgrcst the error.
In a letter in today's Daily (see page
two), SCLC Chairman, Psysiology Prof.

Gene Yates criticizes the student
members' statement calling it
"dangerous" and "unethical."
Yates goes on to say, "They used
their position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon this
community with false authority at a
time when the community is in crisis.
The apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering."
The chairman also announced he
would propose an amendment to the
Judicial Charter to allow for
impeachment of SCLC members.
Currently there is no provision for recall
of members. Yates also pointed out that
SCLC has not passed any legislation this
year.
Not SCLC Statement
Student SCLC member Yale
Braunstein yesterday afternoon clarified
the students' original statement, saying
"This was not an SCLC statement, It
was not held out to be such. The
student members of SCLC all hope that
The Daily will correct any
misrepresentation it may have made.
However, the student members of SCLC
all feel that the statement adequately
represents their position."
"We are distressed that the C' drman

intention of calling any further
meetings. Therefore it should be easy to

understand why the students made their
positions clnar outside of a regular
meeting," Braunstein concluded.
Such's argument, as well as
much of the argument in Friday's
statement, hinges on the extent of
the residual powers granted the
President in Section Four of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
Section Four reads, "Although
nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the
authority and power of the
President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing
student conduct at Stanford
University, except in
extraordinary circumstances the
SCLC and the Student Judicial
Council shall have primary
responsibility for promulgating
such regulations and adjudicating
violations thereof."
Critics of the suspensions argue
both that an emergency situation
did not occur and that, even if it
did occur, the President had no
authority to suspend students.
The Stanford Judicial Council,
in a finding published April 18,
recommended, in a 7-2 decision,
that President Pitzer assume the
powers given him under Section
Four in any sit-ins this Spring,
subject to certain restraints, such
as refusal of at least ten students
involved to identify themselves

after an order to leave the
building has been given.
Recommendation
Specifically, the Council
recommended immediate
temporary suspensions for
students involved in such sit-ins.
The Council, while mentioning in
its decision the possibility of a
court injunction against
non-students, did not recommend
injunctions against students.
The two dissenters, student
members Paul Holdorf and
Richard Lee, agreed that the
President has the right to exercise
emergency powers under Section
Four, but they did not think the
Council should recommend
specific penalties if the President
decided to act under Section
Four.
At a meeting Friday, the
Committee of Fifteen, a
s tu dent-faculty-ad m inistration
body charged with assisting in the
solution of problems common to
all three constituencies, passed a

members of SCLC have made a
statement attacking the recent
suspensions as "academic punishment
for political activity . .
In Friday's edition, THE DAILY
mistakenly attributed the statement by
the student members of SCLC as being a
statement by the entire Council. It was
not. The statement should have ben
attributed to the five student SCLC
members. THE DAILY rcgrcst the error.
In a letter in today's Daily (see page
two), SCLC Chairman, Psysiology Prof.

Gene Yates criticizes the student
members' statement calling it
"dangerous" and "unethical."
Yates goes on to say, "They used
their position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon this
community with false authority at a
time when the community is in crisis.
The apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering."
The chairman also announced he
would propose an amendment to the
Judicial Charter to allow for
impeachment of SCLC members.
Currently there is no provision for recall
of members. Yates also pointed out that
SCLC has not passed any legislation this
year.
Not SCLC Statement
Student SCLC member Yale
Braunstein yesterday afternoon clarified
the students' original statement, saying
"This was not an SCLC statement, It
was not held out to be such. The
student members of SCLC all hope that
The Daily will correct any
misrepresentation it may have made.
However, the student members of SCLC
all feel that the statement adequately
represents their position."
"We are distressed that the C' drman
of SCLC has not called a meeting for
two weeks and has stated that he has no
intention of calling any further
meetings. Therefore it should be easy to
understand why the students made their
positions clnar outside of a regular
meeting," Braunstein concluded.
Such's argument, as well as
much of the argument in Friday's
statement, hinges on the extent of
the residual powers granted the
President in Section Four of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
Section Four reads, "Although
nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the
authority and power of the
President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing
student conduct at Stanford
University, except in
extraordinary circumstances the
SCLC and the Student Judicial
Council shall have primary
responsibility for promulgating
such regulations and adjudicating
violations thereof."
Critics of the suspensions argue
both that an emergency situation
did not occur and that, even if it
did occur, the President had no
authority to suspend students.
The Stanford Judicial Council,
in a finding published April 18,
recommended, in a 7-2 decision,
that President Pitzer assume the
powers given him under Section
Four in any sit-ins this Spring,
subject to certain restraints, such
as refusal of at least ten students
involved to identify themselves

after an order to leave the
building has been given.
Recommendation
Specifically, the Council
recommended immediate
temporary suspensions for
students involved in such sit-ins.
The Council, while mentioning in
its decision the possibility of a
court injunction against
non-students, did not recommend
injunctions against students.
The two dissenters, student
members Paul Holdorf and
Richard Lee, agreed that the
President has the right to exercise
emergency powers under Section
Four, but they did not think the
Council should recommend
specific penalties if the President
decided to act under Section
Four.
At a meeting Friday, the
Committee of Fifteen, a
s tu dent-faculty-ad m inistration
body charged with assisting in the
solution of problems common to
all three constituencies, passed a
resolution supporting both the
President and the Judicial Council
and saying that they had acted
"within their powers under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter"
in regard to the suspension of
students involved in the Encina
sit-in.
The legal right of the President to
suspend students without a hearing is
under attack by the student members of
the Student Conduct Legialative
Council (SCLC). The faculty Chairman
of SCLC has responded with an attack
on a statement by the five student
members.
SCLC, the student-faculty body
charged with promulgating rules for

student conduct, has eleven members,
six faculty and five students.
In a column in today's Daily (see
page 3) SCLC member law student
Richard Such and fellow law student
Bill Cozad claim that an amendment to
the Founding Grant of the University
prohibits the University President from
taking disciplinary action against
students without a hearing.
The amendment, added by Mrs.
Stanford in 1902, states, "It shall be the
duty of the Board of Trustees to make
general laws providing for the
government of the University, and to
provide for just and equitable rules of
discipline." The amendment was
enacted after then President David Starr
Jordan had suspended, without a
hearing, some students.
Encina No Emergency
The column further states that even
if the President does have emergency
power to take disciplinary action against
students, the occupation of Encina Hall
did not constitute such an emergency
situation.

was not held out to be such. The
student members of SCLC all hope that
The Daily will correct any
misrepresentation it may have made.
However, the student members of SCLC
all feel that the statement adequately
represents their position."
"We are distressed that the C' drman
of SCLC has not called a meeting for
two weeks and has stated that he has no
intention of calling any further
meetings. Therefore it should be easy to
understand why the students made their
positions clnar outside of a regular
meeting," Braunstein concluded.
Such's argument, as well as
much of the argument in Friday's
statement, hinges on the extent of
the residual powers granted the
President in Section Four of the
Legislative and Judicial Charter.
Section Four reads, "Although
nothing in these articles shall be
deemed to contravene or limit the
authority and power of the
President to promulgate and
enforce regulations governing
student conduct at Stanford
University, except in
extraordinary circumstances the
SCLC and the Student Judicial
Council shall have primary
responsibility for promulgating
such regulations and adjudicating
violations thereof."
Critics of the suspensions argue
both that an emergency situation
did not occur and that, even if it
did occur, the President had no
authority to suspend students.
The Stanford Judicial Council,
in a finding published April 18,
recommended, in a 7-2 decision,
that President Pitzer assume the
powers given him under Section
Four in any sit-ins this Spring,
subject to certain restraints, such
as refusal of at least ten students
involved to identify themselves

after an order to leave the
building has been given.
Recommendation
Specifically, the Council
recommended immediate
temporary suspensions for
students involved in such sit-ins.
The Council, while mentioning in
its decision the possibility of a
court injunction against
non-students, did not recommend
injunctions against students.
The two dissenters, student
members Paul Holdorf and
Richard Lee, agreed that the
President has the right to exercise
emergency powers under Section
Four, but they did not think the
Council should recommend
specific penalties if the President
decided to act under Section
Four.
At a meeting Friday, the
Committee of Fifteen, a
s tu dent-faculty-ad m inistration
body charged with assisting in the
solution of problems common to
all three constituencies, passed a
resolution supporting both the
President and the Judicial Council
and saying that they had acted
"within their powers under the
Legislative and Judicial Charter"
in regard to the suspension of
students involved in the Encina
sit-in.
The legal right of the President to
suspend students without a hearing is
under attack by the student members of
the Student Conduct Legialative
Council (SCLC). The faculty Chairman
of SCLC has responded with an attack
on a statement by the five student
members.
SCLC, the student-faculty body
charged with promulgating rules for

student conduct, has eleven members,
six faculty and five students.
In a column in today's Daily (see
page 3) SCLC member law student
Richard Such and fellow law student
Bill Cozad claim that an amendment to
the Founding Grant of the University
prohibits the University President from
taking disciplinary action against
students without a hearing.
The amendment, added by Mrs.
Stanford in 1902, states, "It shall be the
duty of the Board of Trustees to make
general laws providing for the
government of the University, and to
provide for just and equitable rules of
discipline." The amendment was
enacted after then President David Starr
Jordan had suspended, without a
hearing, some students.
Encina No Emergency
The column further states that even
if the President does have emergency
power to take disciplinary action against
students, the occupation of Encina Hall
did not constitute such an emergency
situation.
In addition, the five student
members of SCLC have made a
statement attacking the recent
suspensions as "academic punishment
for political activity . .
In Friday's edition, THE DAILY
mistakenly attributed the statement by
the student members of SCLC as being a
statement by the entire Council. It was
not. The statement should have ben
attributed to the five student SCLC
members. THE DAILY rcgrcst the error.
In a letter in today's Daily (see page
two), SCLC Chairman, Psysiology Prof.

Gene Yates criticizes the student
members' statement calling it
"dangerous" and "unethical."
Yates goes on to say, "They used
their position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon this
community with false authority at a
time when the community is in crisis.
The apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering."
The chairman also announced he
would propose an amendment to the
Judicial Charter to allow for
impeachment of SCLC members.
Currently there is no provision for recall
of members. Yates also pointed out that
SCLC has not passed any legislation this
year.
Not SCLC Statement
Student SCLC member Yale
Braunstein yesterday afternoon clarified
the students' original statement, saying
"This was not an SCLC statement, It
was not held out to be such. The
student members of SCLC all hope that
The Daily will correct any
misrepresentation it may have made.
However, the student members of SCLC
