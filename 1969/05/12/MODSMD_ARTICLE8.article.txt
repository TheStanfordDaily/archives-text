# SCLC Chairman Reacts
## Suspension Controversy 
### THOMAS C. DAWSON 
The legal right of the President to
suspend students without a hearing is
under attack by the student members of
the Student Conduct Legialative
Council (SCLC). The faculty Chairman
of SCLC has responded with an attack
on a statement by the five student
members.
SCLC, the student-faculty body
charged with promulgating rules for

student conduct, has eleven members,
six faculty and five students.
In a column in today's Daily (see
page 3) SCLC member law student
Richard Such and fellow law student
Bill Cozad claim that an amendment to
the Founding Grant of the University
prohibits the University President from
taking disciplinary action against
students without a hearing.
The amendment, added by Mrs.
Stanford in 1902, states, "It shall be the
duty of the Board of Trustees to make
general laws providing for the
government of the University, and to
provide for just and equitable rules of
discipline." The amendment was
enacted after then President David Starr
Jordan had suspended, without a
hearing, some students.
Encina No Emergency
The column further states that even
if the President does have emergency
power to take disciplinary action against
students, the occupation of Encina Hall
did not constitute such an emergency
situation.
In addition, the five student
members of SCLC have made a
statement attacking the recent
suspensions as "academic punishment
for political activity . .
In Friday's edition, THE DAILY
mistakenly attributed the statement by
the student members of SCLC as being a
statement by the entire Council. It was
not. The statement should have ben
attributed to the five student SCLC
members. THE DAILY rcgrcst the error.
In a letter in today's Daily (see page
two), SCLC Chairman, Psysiology Prof.

Gene Yates criticizes the student
members' statement calling it
"dangerous" and "unethical."
Yates goes on to say, "They used
their position on the SCLC to impose
their personal political views upon this
community with false authority at a
time when the community is in crisis.
The apparent aim of their document
was to weaken the capacity of this
community to achieve private
ordering."
The chairman also announced he
would propose an amendment to the
Judicial Charter to allow for
impeachment of SCLC members.
Currently there is no provision for recall
of members. Yates also pointed out that
SCLC has not passed any legislation this
year.
Not SCLC Statement
Student SCLC member Yale
Braunstein yesterday afternoon clarified
the students' original statement, saying
"This was not an SCLC statement, It
was not held out to be such. The
student members of SCLC all hope that
The Daily will correct any
misrepresentation it may have made.
However, the student members of SCLC
all feel that the statement adequately
represents their position."
"We are distressed that the C' drman
of SCLC has not called a meeting for
two weeks and has stated that he has no
intention of calling any further
meetings. Therefore it should be easy to
understand why the students made their
positions clnar outside of a regular
