! C-15 Resolutions jj
At its meeting of May 9th (at which eleven members were ;l
;' present) the Committee of Fifteen unanimously adopted the ;j
;! following resolution: j;
It has been brought to our attention that questions have been jj
j' raised by student members of SCLC as to the legitimacy of the j
|> President's suspension of students involved in the Sncina sit-in. !
j» We consider that both the President and the Stanford Judicial <!
j» Council acted within their powers under the Legislative and <!
J; Judicial Charter. Article IV of the Charter reads, "Although jj
jj nothing in these articles shall be deemed to contravene or limit j!
jj the authority and power of the President to promulgate and <!
jj enforce regulations governing student conduct at Stanford |i
University, except in extraordinary circumstances the SCLC and !
jj SJC shall have primary responsibility for promulgating such !
regulations and adjudicating violations thereof." >
At the same meeting, the Committee of Fifteen passed (with ;j
J; one abstention) the following resolution: >
While the Committee of Fifteen has not carefully considered <j
jj the proposal of the Coalition for an Academic Community for jj
jj establishing procedures by which interested individual students or j!
j' student group representatives may petition for a hearing before j!
jj the Board of Trustees, we endorse the suggestion that such <1
j 1 procedures be developed. We recommend that the University
jj Advisory Committee carefully consider the CAC j!
jj recommendations and urge the adoption of appropriate j!
j 1 procedures as soon as possible. We offer the services of the COF <1
jj in whatever way may be appropriate. ;!
