# 24 Faculty Back 'Amherst Letter'
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
Following the lead of Amherst
College, twenty-four Stanford faculty
members, many of them nationally
prominent, have drafted a letter to
President Nixon criticizing his national
policy. It also questions Nixon's
comments on campus disruption.
Faculty and students will circulate
the statement this week among other
professors, students, and staff. President
Pitzer has promised to send it to the
President when an appropriate number
of names have been obtained.
The main body of the letter contains
a passage quoted from the Amherst
statement of earlier this month. The
Stanford faculty addendum to that
passage comments:
"At Stanford University, just as at
many other institutions, we have
recently had some student disturbances
of a disruptive nature. Although the
majority of students and faculty
disapprove of this form of protest, it is
also true that a majority of the
University community identifies with
the moral sentimenLs which led to these
outbreaks.
"Frustrated Feelings"
"We feel you should realize that such
outbreaks are symptoms of the
frustrated feelings of most of us on this
campus, and indeed on most university
campuses in the United States, that
there are major deficiencies in the
country in urgent need of correction."
The letter comments skeptically on
the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
Professor Marvin Chodrow,
Executive Head and Director of Applied
Physics as well as Professor of Electrical
Engineering and Director of Hansen
Microwave Laboratory, was
instrumental in organizing the Stanford
effort.

Commenting on the purpose of the
action, Chodrow said: "It is an attempt
to bring these problems to the attention
of the government and to add our voice
to that of Amherst. We wanted to say
that whatever the short-term problems
of the University, the government and
the University must be involved in
working to find solutions to the
long-range problems. There is a lot of
feeling on campus besides that shown
by the demonstrators."

"We feel you should realize that such
outbreaks are symptoms of the
frustrated feelings of most of us on this
campus, and indeed on most university
campuses in the United States, that
there are major deficiencies in the
country in urgent need of correction."
The letter comments skeptically on
the U.S. involvement in Vietnam.
Professor Marvin Chodrow,
Executive Head and Director of Applied
Physics as well as Professor of Electrical
Engineering and Director of Hansen
Microwave Laboratory, was
instrumental in organizing the Stanford
effort.

Commenting on the purpose of the
action, Chodrow said: "It is an attempt
to bring these problems to the attention
of the government and to add our voice
to that of Amherst. We wanted to say
that whatever the short-term problems
of the University, the government and
the University must be involved in
working to find solutions to the
long-range problems. There is a lot of
feeling on campus besides that shown
by the demonstrators."
