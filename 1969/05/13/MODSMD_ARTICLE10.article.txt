## Free Inquiry Threatened 
### William J. Platt 
In the whole strange ordeal of
the April 3rd Movement, Scott
Committee, and what may
become Stanford's equivalent of
Parisians' "Events of May," a
principle seems to have been
neglected. It is the time-tested
notion of freedom of inquiry. To
me freedom of inquiry is part of
that larger constellation called
academic freedom. Until the A3M
movement struck here I thought
much of the student rebellion had
to do with extending academic
freedom and increasing student
participation in governance. To
the extent it did, I identified with
it, often at some peril to my
credibility with more prudent
colleagues.
But now the ASM students and
faculty seem to have no
reservations about breaching
freedom of inquiry. They would
prohibit study of phenomena that
they loosely label "war research."
Today their targets are CBW and
Counterinsurgency research, but
for tomorrow their radars are

tilting toward research on
"economic imperialism abroad"
and ''domestic counter
insurgency." Is freedom of
inquiry into legally authorized
activities at all divisible?
Let me personalize why I reject
prohibitions and censorship. I
reject them for the same reasons
that others like myself who are
opposed to the war in Vietnam
should. The United States
continues the war in Vietnam
while seeking a solution at the
Paris conference table.
C on g r e s s—elected by the
majority—appropriates money for
that policy and the
Administration —chosen by the
majority—opts to administer that
public policy. I disagree with that
policy, favoring a unilateral
withdrawal now.
The A3M is demanding a single
policy—theirs—and is ready to
coerce others who do not
conform. Suppose their demand
for a single policy is met. Which
single policy will be in effect? Not

that of the A3M, but that of the
majority—as reflected in the
behavior of Congress and the
Administration. Where is the
opportunity for dissent in such an
A3M-designed monolith? Is not
this the ultimate imperialsim?
Pluralism and diversity, hallmarks
of academic, are victims of the
new coercion.
And so it would go with
research—with injury. For
example, from the evidence I've
seen and from my own
predispositions, I believe in
desegregated education and would
like to do more studies that might
speed equality of educational
opportunity. But the current
majority in both Congress and the
Executive branch believe local
option objectives transcend
desegregation objectives. Am I to
be proscribed from such heretical
research because my views are at
variance with the consensus? I
would be, if our communities
start abridging freedom as ASM
proposes.

I feel self-consciously
patronizing in advancing such a
banal argument. But silence in
these times is not golden - it's
yellow.
Perhaps we need to debate a
new freedom—that of freedom
from private coercion. Private
coercion occurs in that fuzzy
boarder that lies at the edge of
Ie g i t imate —indeed socially
useful — protest and
demonstration. Our society's
tolerance for dissent manifested
by protest and demonstration
extends to the point of
discomfort and inconvenience.
But when legitimate protest and
demonstration undergo a
transformation into a realm in
which the movement attacks the
vitals of academic freedom—the
freedom of inquiry—it is engaging
in matricide.
