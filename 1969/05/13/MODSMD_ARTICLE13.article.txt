## Open Letter To The Trustees 
### Paul Drexter 
It is a strange experience to explain to someone
that they are totally wrong. I have never
attempted it before. Not the policies, but the
foundations of your political outlook are wrong. I
cannot argue that they are morally wrong. There is
a much more potent indictment. The basis of your
thinking is irrelevent. Can you see this?
Here is our first, perhaps most profound
difference. I doubt that you have ever sincerely
tried to judge a crisis from our point of view.
When you condescend to talk to us we are both
dogmatic, morally on the same plane. But we do
have a deep empathy, for the Blacks, and through
them, the Vietnamese. These are the people
America has long misunderstood and now
confronts.
Ultimately we face nuclear war. In defense you
offer us the policies which have created two world
wars. You see only in terms of these wars. Rather
than rising above them, you have submitted to
their logic. In our minds, the attitudes which
allowed you to survive these wars is no longer
possible. Another war would not only burn our
civilizations, but would change the way in which
humans live. The survivors will not be the same
kind of men and women we know. This is the

most frightening thought, that human continuity
will be broken. And the existence of nuclear
weapons must eventually lead to their use. To
argue that their destructiveness will prevent their
use is an inanity in this century of incredible and
escalated destruction. We have grown up with this
feai —a fear so deep, that when honestly
confronted, causes love rather than a desire for
self-defense. In our consciousness, war no longer
raises political questions; it must raise a profound
religious question.
You are a hardened, callous, and hypocritical
generation. History has perhaps permitted you
little else. Your outlook is indicted only because
today it is an awesome danger. We see the
twentieth century as having been simply inhuman.
Your achievement is to have survived it. Ours must
be to change it.
We are asking you to drop your roles as
business men, Trustees, and Americans. We are
asking you to break out of your defensiveness. Be
human-beings, or there is no reason, or hope, for us
to be at all.
