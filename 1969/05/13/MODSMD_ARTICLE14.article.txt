## "Fight, Honor And Obey" 
### Jeffrey Blum 
As the American economy
developed, there appeared
corporations so large that the
boards of directors would meet
only occasionally to discuss
finances, and would leave
execution of routine business in
the hands of seemingly
autonomous managers. Some of
these giant corporations were
called multiversities because of
their high and expanding
production of multiverses or
publications. Despite the

managers' preoccupation with
multiverses, it was generally
agreed that the multiversity's
most important product was its
own workers who were trained
and socialized to become
managers of either multiversities
or other corporations.
This stytem worked well until
one day a cowboy seized power
and started a war. Even though
the war grew large, it seemed
puny, and no one wanted to fight.
To get workers to staff the war,
the cowboy had to tap the
dreaded draught. In the
multiversities managers were
displeased and workers outraged.
After passing petitions and
yelling, "Hell no, we won't go,"
workers and a few managers with
proletarian consciousness
discovered that the war hadn't
sprung full-blown from the mind
of a cowboy, but started out long
before as nation-building. In the
words of Hubert Bumkin,
"We went in there with the
intention of building a nation. But
then our men were ruthlessly
attacked and we had to defend
them. As the enemy increased its
force, we had to increase ours,
and now our investment (sic!) is
too great to let the Communists
run willy-nilly all over the globe."
"H'mm," thought the workers,
"if nation-building (sometimes
abbreviated COIN) precedes
American involvement in wars,
then perhaps we ought to stop
nation-building instead of
worrying about which cowboy
becomes President." Then the
workers discovered a plethora of
nation-building right in the
multiversity's wholly owned
subsidiary, the Subtrafuge
Research Institute. An ambitious
group of workers approached the
managers to complain about the
nation-building and the board of
directors who was allowing it to
happen. The managers responded,
Highest Good
"Don't worry about the
directors. They don't control the
multiversity, but we do, the very
same managers who give you your
daily work detail. As for stopping
nation-building research, that
would infringe upon managerial
freedom which is the highest good
of civilization."
Then there was a work
stoppage in a laboratory, and
production of electronic zappers
was slowed drastically. Fearing
other work stoppages, the
managers became very
accomodating.
"We agree whole heartedly that
nation-building is bad and ought
to be stopped, but it's just a

question of the best way to do it.
We must also consider getting
money to finance good research
(mine) as well as getting rid of bad
research."
Naive
The naive workers thought this
was fine and waited for the
managerial senate to assert itself
to the directors. Meanwhile, a
committee had said that if the
managers agreed to sell SRI
instead of stopping its
nation-building, they would get
thirty-five million dollars, enough
for five new cars and twenty color
televisions each. Surprisingly and
predictably, the managerial senate
did next to nothing.
"We don't have authority on
this issue. The decision must be
left up to the directors who
probably will decide against you."
The workers reasoned, "If
everyone agrees with us about
stopping nation-building, and the
directors are going to decide
against us, then we have to place
strong pressure on the directors."
So they occupied $ solar plexus.
This time managers and
bureaucrats agreed that what they
(along with the directors) had
really wanted to do all along was
to smash the workers' movement
and restore order. Paging through
the corporate manual, they
discovered that the most
successful method of dealing with
work stoppages in the past had
been a combination of
injunctions, police and
termination of employment.
Absurd
Some protested the
repressions, saying it was absurd
to suspend seventy of the
brightest workers. Managers and
bureaucrats responded,
''We're not going to
permanently suspend all seventy,
only the hard core who can't be
rehabilitated. And even if we were
to suspend a hundred, that would
still be less than 1% of the total
enrollment. Compared to a
national unemployment rate of
4%, such an action would be
trivial (and would certainly please
the directors.)"
"But does it make sense to
throw out intelligent workers
basically because they oppose the
same war and nation-building that
you oppose?" The managers and
bureaucrats shook their heads.
"These workers haven't just
opposed war and nation-building.
They have been deliberately
disobedient on several occasions,
and they seem to have no respect
for either the institution or
managerial freedom. And it
doesn't matter whether they are

intelligent or not. In America it's
not a man's birthright or his
natural gifts that count, it's what
he does as a man."
"And what are they supposed
to do?" came the question.
"Fight, honor and obey," came
the reply.

boards of directors would meet
only occasionally to discuss
finances, and would leave
execution of routine business in
the hands of seemingly
autonomous managers. Some of
these giant corporations were
called multiversities because of
their high and expanding
production of multiverses or
publications. Despite the

managers' preoccupation with
multiverses, it was generally
agreed that the multiversity's
most important product was its
own workers who were trained
and socialized to become
managers of either multiversities
or other corporations.
This stytem worked well until
one day a cowboy seized power
and started a war. Even though
the war grew large, it seemed
puny, and no one wanted to fight.
To get workers to staff the war,
the cowboy had to tap the
dreaded draught. In the
multiversities managers were
displeased and workers outraged.
After passing petitions and
yelling, "Hell no, we won't go,"
workers and a few managers with
proletarian consciousness
discovered that the war hadn't
sprung full-blown from the mind
of a cowboy, but started out long
before as nation-building. In the
words of Hubert Bumkin,
"We went in there with the
intention of building a nation. But
then our men were ruthlessly
attacked and we had to defend
them. As the enemy increased its
force, we had to increase ours,
and now our investment (sic!) is
too great to let the Communists
run willy-nilly all over the globe."
"H'mm," thought the workers,
"if nation-building (sometimes
abbreviated COIN) precedes
American involvement in wars,
then perhaps we ought to stop
nation-building instead of
worrying about which cowboy
becomes President." Then the
workers discovered a plethora of
nation-building right in the
multiversity's wholly owned
subsidiary, the Subtrafuge
Research Institute. An ambitious
group of workers approached the
managers to complain about the
nation-building and the board of
directors who was allowing it to
happen. The managers responded,
Highest Good
"Don't worry about the
directors. They don't control the
multiversity, but we do, the very
same managers who give you your
daily work detail. As for stopping
nation-building research, that
would infringe upon managerial
freedom which is the highest good
of civilization."
Then there was a work
stoppage in a laboratory, and
production of electronic zappers
was slowed drastically. Fearing
other work stoppages, the
managers became very
accomodating.
"We agree whole heartedly that
nation-building is bad and ought
to be stopped, but it's just a

question of the best way to do it.
We must also consider getting
money to finance good research
(mine) as well as getting rid of bad
research."
Naive
The naive workers thought this
was fine and waited for the
managerial senate to assert itself
to the directors. Meanwhile, a
committee had said that if the
managers agreed to sell SRI
instead of stopping its
nation-building, they would get
thirty-five million dollars, enough
for five new cars and twenty color
televisions each. Surprisingly and
predictably, the managerial senate
did next to nothing.
"We don't have authority on
this issue. The decision must be
left up to the directors who
probably will decide against you."
The workers reasoned, "If
everyone agrees with us about
stopping nation-building, and the
directors are going to decide
against us, then we have to place
strong pressure on the directors."
So they occupied $ solar plexus.
This time managers and
bureaucrats agreed that what they
(along with the directors) had
really wanted to do all along was
to smash the workers' movement
and restore order. Paging through
the corporate manual, they
discovered that the most
successful method of dealing with
work stoppages in the past had
been a combination of
injunctions, police and
termination of employment.
Absurd
Some protested the
repressions, saying it was absurd
to suspend seventy of the
brightest workers. Managers and
bureaucrats responded,
''We're not going to
permanently suspend all seventy,
only the hard core who can't be
rehabilitated. And even if we were
to suspend a hundred, that would
still be less than 1% of the total
enrollment. Compared to a
national unemployment rate of
4%, such an action would be
trivial (and would certainly please
the directors.)"
"But does it make sense to
throw out intelligent workers
basically because they oppose the
same war and nation-building that
you oppose?" The managers and
bureaucrats shook their heads.
"These workers haven't just
opposed war and nation-building.
They have been deliberately
disobedient on several occasions,
and they seem to have no respect
for either the institution or
managerial freedom. And it
doesn't matter whether they are

intelligent or not. In America it's
not a man's birthright or his
natural gifts that count, it's what
he does as a man."
"And what are they supposed
to do?" came the question.
"Fight, honor and obey," came
the reply.

the hands of seemingly
autonomous managers. Some of
these giant corporations were
called multiversities because of
their high and expanding
production of multiverses or
publications. Despite the

managers' preoccupation with
multiverses, it was generally
agreed that the multiversity's
most important product was its
own workers who were trained
and socialized to become
managers of either multiversities
or other corporations.
This stytem worked well until
one day a cowboy seized power
and started a war. Even though
the war grew large, it seemed
puny, and no one wanted to fight.
To get workers to staff the war,
the cowboy had to tap the
dreaded draught. In the
multiversities managers were
displeased and workers outraged.
After passing petitions and
yelling, "Hell no, we won't go,"
workers and a few managers with
proletarian consciousness
discovered that the war hadn't
sprung full-blown from the mind
of a cowboy, but started out long
before as nation-building. In the
words of Hubert Bumkin,
"We went in there with the
intention of building a nation. But
then our men were ruthlessly
attacked and we had to defend
them. As the enemy increased its
force, we had to increase ours,
and now our investment (sic!) is
too great to let the Communists
run willy-nilly all over the globe."
"H'mm," thought the workers,
"if nation-building (sometimes
abbreviated COIN) precedes
American involvement in wars,
then perhaps we ought to stop
nation-building instead of
worrying about which cowboy
becomes President." Then the
workers discovered a plethora of
nation-building right in the
multiversity's wholly owned
subsidiary, the Subtrafuge
Research Institute. An ambitious
group of workers approached the
managers to complain about the
nation-building and the board of
directors who was allowing it to
happen. The managers responded,
Highest Good
"Don't worry about the
directors. They don't control the
multiversity, but we do, the very
same managers who give you your
daily work detail. As for stopping
nation-building research, that
would infringe upon managerial
freedom which is the highest good
of civilization."
Then there was a work
stoppage in a laboratory, and
production of electronic zappers
was slowed drastically. Fearing
other work stoppages, the
managers became very
accomodating.
"We agree whole heartedly that
nation-building is bad and ought
to be stopped, but it's just a

question of the best way to do it.
We must also consider getting
money to finance good research
(mine) as well as getting rid of bad
research."
Naive
The naive workers thought this
was fine and waited for the
managerial senate to assert itself
to the directors. Meanwhile, a
committee had said that if the
managers agreed to sell SRI
instead of stopping its
nation-building, they would get
thirty-five million dollars, enough
for five new cars and twenty color
televisions each. Surprisingly and
predictably, the managerial senate
did next to nothing.
"We don't have authority on
this issue. The decision must be
left up to the directors who
probably will decide against you."
The workers reasoned, "If
everyone agrees with us about
stopping nation-building, and the
directors are going to decide
against us, then we have to place
strong pressure on the directors."
So they occupied $ solar plexus.
This time managers and
bureaucrats agreed that what they
(along with the directors) had
really wanted to do all along was
to smash the workers' movement
and restore order. Paging through
the corporate manual, they
discovered that the most
successful method of dealing with
work stoppages in the past had
been a combination of
injunctions, police and
termination of employment.
Absurd
Some protested the
repressions, saying it was absurd
to suspend seventy of the
brightest workers. Managers and
bureaucrats responded,
''We're not going to
permanently suspend all seventy,
only the hard core who can't be
rehabilitated. And even if we were
to suspend a hundred, that would
still be less than 1% of the total
enrollment. Compared to a
national unemployment rate of
4%, such an action would be
trivial (and would certainly please
the directors.)"
"But does it make sense to
throw out intelligent workers
basically because they oppose the
same war and nation-building that
you oppose?" The managers and
bureaucrats shook their heads.
"These workers haven't just
opposed war and nation-building.
They have been deliberately
disobedient on several occasions,
and they seem to have no respect
for either the institution or
managerial freedom. And it
doesn't matter whether they are

intelligent or not. In America it's
not a man's birthright or his
natural gifts that count, it's what
he does as a man."
"And what are they supposed
to do?" came the question.
"Fight, honor and obey," came
the reply.

As the American economy
developed, there appeared
corporations so large that the
boards of directors would meet
only occasionally to discuss
finances, and would leave
execution of routine business in
the hands of seemingly
autonomous managers. Some of

called multiversities because of
