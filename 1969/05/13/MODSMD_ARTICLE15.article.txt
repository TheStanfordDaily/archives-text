## Faculty Should Join A3M 
### Mark Sapir 
Despite the overwhelming
campus support for the demands
of the April 3rd Movement, the
A3M is in the unenviable position
of bucking the administration and
the faculty as well as the Trustees.
The student body should
ridicule the faculty for abdicating
its responsibility for change on
the campus. The recent Academic
Senate resolution on SRI
"suggests that the President
consider recommending to the
Board of Trustees further detailed
exploration . . ." and even leaves
out the possibility of retention of
SRI under community guidelines.
The faculty, although supporting
our basic demands in the Maccoby
poll, is so covetous of its tenuous
power role in the University that
it willfully and willingly has
granted powers of martial law to
Kenneth Pitzer.
In going along with and often
supporting the court injunction
and the calling of outside police,
the faculty is saying that it is
much more frightened by the
potential outside threat that the

Trustees can muster to disrupt
this "open liberal University"
than it is of the power of a few
militant students. Morally the
faculty is on our side, but
politically the faculty will go with
the side that is most likely to
preserve the faculty's stability on
the campus. At this time when the
entire legal apparatus—from the
SJC to the Court Injunction—is
dedicated to the existing order,
that side is the Trustees.
Therefore, the only method
student activists have to push the
faculty to their side is the threat
of disorder. Indeed, the serious
threat of disrupting the faculty's
control at the University-
Stanford or elsewhere —is a more
influential factor than any act of
disruption itself. That is why last
year's sit-in provoked.-support in
the Academic Council (among
moderates as well as
sympathizers): non-support was a
vote for more militant action and
counter-action. The tactics of
gradual measured escalation is as
effective in pressing the faculty (a

potential ally) as it is against the
Trustees (our true opponents).
Given this position, the A3M
must carefully weigh the
usefulness of different tactics. It
would be beneficial to show the
faculty that their "support" of
our demands is desirable; that it
must be as vigorous as their
support of our enemies' tactics:
the court injunction, the police,
the Army. Until the Academic
Senate takes a public position
against cou nterinsurgency at
Stanford and at SRI we sould
gradually increase the pressure on
campus.
I think that action against the
University is all the more
unfortunate because students,
many of whom can learn good
skills, useful to the building of a
strong anti-capitalist movement in
the U.S., will jeopardize their
positions at Stanford by
on-campus action. In general, I
have been arguing against the need
for that jeopardy on the basis that
SRI is our target (SRI Hanover is
the counterinsurgency center) and
direct action at that site will mean
only a confrontation with police
but not with police and Jack
Friedenthal's SJC too.
However, I am in a minority on
that point; and I suppose that is
rightfully so, as long as the faculty
remains negligent. The faculty
must learn that students are very
serious; if the faculty wants order
on our campus, it would be wise
to un-table the Academic Senate
motions on counter-insurgency
work at Stanford and SRI and
back up moral convictions with
some moral courage. If the Senate
does not do this before
Wednesday noon it will only be
asking for trouble. It is time that
the faculty side with students
against the common enemy of a
new and progressive society—the
corporations and their leaders.
Until that happens the faculty can
only serve to blunt our attacks
and to prevent us from becoming
an effective force for change in
this society.

The student body should
ridicule the faculty for abdicating
its responsibility for change on
the campus. The recent Academic
Senate resolution on SRI
"suggests that the President

out the possibility of retention of
SRI under community guidelines.
The faculty, although supporting
our basic demands in the Maccoby
poll, is so covetous of its tenuous
power role in the University that
it willfully and willingly has
granted powers of martial law to
Kenneth Pitzer.
In going along with and often
supporting the court injunction
and the calling of outside police,
the faculty is saying that it is
much more frightened by the
potential outside threat that the

Trustees can muster to disrupt
this "open liberal University"
than it is of the power of a few
militant students. Morally the
faculty is on our side, but
politically the faculty will go with
the side that is most likely to
preserve the faculty's stability on
the campus. At this time when the
entire legal apparatus—from the
SJC to the Court Injunction—is
dedicated to the existing order,
that side is the Trustees.
Therefore, the only method
student activists have to push the
faculty to their side is the threat
of disorder. Indeed, the serious
threat of disrupting the faculty's
control at the University-
Stanford or elsewhere —is a more
influential factor than any act of
disruption itself. That is why last
year's sit-in provoked.-support in
the Academic Council (among
moderates as well as
sympathizers): non-support was a
vote for more militant action and
counter-action. The tactics of
gradual measured escalation is as
effective in pressing the faculty (a

potential ally) as it is against the
Trustees (our true opponents).
Given this position, the A3M
must carefully weigh the
usefulness of different tactics. It
would be beneficial to show the
faculty that their "support" of
our demands is desirable; that it
must be as vigorous as their
support of our enemies' tactics:
the court injunction, the police,
the Army. Until the Academic
Senate takes a public position
against cou nterinsurgency at
Stanford and at SRI we sould
gradually increase the pressure on
campus.
I think that action against the
University is all the more
unfortunate because students,
many of whom can learn good
skills, useful to the building of a
strong anti-capitalist movement in
the U.S., will jeopardize their
positions at Stanford by
on-campus action. In general, I
have been arguing against the need
for that jeopardy on the basis that
SRI is our target (SRI Hanover is
the counterinsurgency center) and
direct action at that site will mean
only a confrontation with police
but not with police and Jack
Friedenthal's SJC too.
However, I am in a minority on
that point; and I suppose that is
rightfully so, as long as the faculty
remains negligent. The faculty
must learn that students are very
serious; if the faculty wants order
on our campus, it would be wise
to un-table the Academic Senate
motions on counter-insurgency
work at Stanford and SRI and
back up moral convictions with
some moral courage. If the Senate
does not do this before
Wednesday noon it will only be
asking for trouble. It is time that
the faculty side with students
against the common enemy of a
new and progressive society—the
corporations and their leaders.
Until that happens the faculty can
only serve to blunt our attacks
and to prevent us from becoming
an effective force for change in
this society.
