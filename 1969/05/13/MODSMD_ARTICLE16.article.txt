# A3M Denied

### 
A group of students spent last
Thursday in San Francisco
unsuccessfully attempting to beat
the establishment at its own game.
The April 3 Movement
students sought to place a
$163.80 advertisement in the Wall
Street Journal that would
discourage prospective Stanford
Research Institute purchasers, in
the event that the University
decides to sell the Institute.
The ad request was turned
down after a six hour wait while
the local ad manager consulted his
superiors. The advertisement was
termed "unacceptable," as it did
not meet the paper's advertising
policy. The terms of that policy
were not explained.
The piece of copy thai

represented the Movement's first
venture into corporate capitalism
was entitled, "SRI a bad risk."
and was signed, "Friends of the
April 3 Movement." The text of
the proposed ad:

"A recent cost-benefit analysis
has found that due to the unstable
investment climate created by the
insurgent activities on the
Stanford campus, and in view of
the extreme likelihood that such
activities will continue, purchase
of the Stanford Research Institute
would entail serious risk and
would prove to be highly
unprofitable. While market
conditions remain in such an
uncertain state, prospective
buyers should reject any
consideration of purchase of
SRI."
