# East African Students:
## Independence Urged 
### BILL BANKS 
Three East African Student
leaders voiced their concern
Thursday for the independent
development of African nations,
emphasizing the disdain they feel
for political pressures from both
the Eastern and the Western
powers.
At an informal discussion
sponsored by The Organization of
African Students at Stanford
(OASS) John R. Butime,
president of the Makerere
University Students' Guild,
A.K.D. Odoch, vice president of
international affairs of the guild,
and Matara T. Sabai, president of
the University Hall of Makerere
firmly rejected the idea of
external control of African
affairs.
The three are conducting a
tour of the United States'
Universities in hopes of coming to
a better understanding of the
American students' world.
Sabai spoke briefly about the
international student
organizations that have been
attempting to gain influence at
Makerere. He said that the eastern
students' organizations and the
western concern (which has since
dissolved) have both been
unsuccessful because, "We aren't
interested in Communism or
capitalism. We are interested in
developing our own country."
He further expressed the hope
for a union of African students,
but said that there was pressure
from the outside to keep Africa
from uniting.
When challenged about the
sponsoring behind their visit to
the U.S., Odoch admitted that
the trip was made possible by a
group with obvious "western"
leanings. He said, however, "We
are trying to strike a balance
(between the two powers) and we

are trying to remain non-allied."
Odoch said that the tour was a
part of a study and that there
were no strings attached. Sabai,
continuing along this line said
that 99% of the students they
have talked with at the various
schools have been
"anti-establishment." He said that
they request to speak with these
students and that they have little
or no trouble meeting with them.
Sabai denied that he was going
to return to Makerere to further
the ideals of capitalism. He
emphatically stated that he is a
socialist and that "When I go

back I am not going to be good
boy."
Butime continued, saying that
student power in Uganda is a
recognizable force. He said that
the government doesn't have a
hostile attitude toward the
students and that the students,
for the most part have no
Sabai said that the students of
his country (Tanzania) are
recognized by the people of the
country as a priviledged group.
"The students," he said, "have
sway with the people only when
they are willing to sacrifice some
of the privileges for the
betterment of the people."

they are willing to sacrifice some
of the privileges for the
betterment of the people."
Three East African Student
leaders voiced their concern
Thursday for the independent
development of African nations,
emphasizing the disdain they feel
for political pressures from both
the Eastern and the Western
powers.
At an informal discussion
sponsored by The Organization of
African Students at Stanford
(OASS) John R. Butime,
president of the Makerere
University Students' Guild,
A.K.D. Odoch, vice president of
international affairs of the guild,
and Matara T. Sabai, president of
the University Hall of Makerere
firmly rejected the idea of
external control of African
affairs.
The three are conducting a
tour of the United States'
Universities in hopes of coming to
a better understanding of the
American students' world.
Sabai spoke briefly about the
international student
organizations that have been
attempting to gain influence at
Makerere. He said that the eastern
students' organizations and the
western concern (which has since
dissolved) have both been
unsuccessful because, "We aren't
interested in Communism or
capitalism. We are interested in
developing our own country."
He further expressed the hope
for a union of African students,
but said that there was pressure
from the outside to keep Africa
from uniting.
When challenged about the
sponsoring behind their visit to
the U.S., Odoch admitted that
the trip was made possible by a
group with obvious "western"
leanings. He said, however, "We
are trying to strike a balance
(between the two powers) and we

are trying to remain non-allied."
Odoch said that the tour was a
part of a study and that there
were no strings attached. Sabai,
continuing along this line said
that 99% of the students they
have talked with at the various
schools have been
"anti-establishment." He said that
they request to speak with these
students and that they have little
or no trouble meeting with them.
Sabai denied that he was going
to return to Makerere to further
the ideals of capitalism. He
emphatically stated that he is a
socialist and that "When I go

back I am not going to be good
boy."
Butime continued, saying that
student power in Uganda is a
recognizable force. He said that
the government doesn't have a
hostile attitude toward the
students and that the students,
for the most part have no
Sabai said that the students of
his country (Tanzania) are
recognized by the people of the
country as a priviledged group.
"The students," he said, "have
sway with the people only when
they are willing to sacrifice some
of the privileges for the
betterment of the people."
