# New Documentary Termed 'Remarkable'

### C. CAMPU 
Ron Shanin is a stocky,
balding, middle-aged man whom
you would expect to meet in an
office, factory or department
store. Yet Shanin has just
returned from five-and-a-half
years of exploration and filming
in Central Africa, the result being
a rather remarkable documentary.
African Safari, now at the
Stanford Theatre.

Upon returning to his
boy-hood home of San Francisco,
Shanin commented that, "The
principle objective for making the
film was to present something
different. Unprovoked animals
charge people, but only in
Hollywood pictures, and snakes
drop on people from trees, but
only in Hollywood pictures. We
wanted something genuine." To
achieve this, the producer-writer
director-photographer literally
gambled five years of his life on
the hope that this finished film

would be bought for public
exhibition.
Surprisingly, Shanin had a
forty-page script prepared for the
film which detailed many scenes
without which he would not leave
Africa. Shanin captured many
dangerous animals for zoos and,
in a frightening sequence, killed
an oncoming lion from less than
three feet. The filmaker also
discovered and charted the source
of the Nile in the mist-shrouded
Mountains of the Moon and,
finally, photographed a raging
volcano, unusual in that it sprang
unpredictably from flat cropland.
Shanin had a shooting ratio of
12:1 and sometimes had to wait
months to see his rushes.
The director includes some
rather gruesome footage in his
"non -fiction high adventure"
(natives drinking goat blood and
chipping out their teeth, as well
as one old man eating honey
combs with dozens of bees still
clinging to the dripping mass) but
generally, he stays within the
bounds of audience toleration.
Though not a big game hunter,
Shanin feels that the rapid
extermination of wildlife on the
Dark Continent is due to the
increase in native population and
tribal poaching, not to the rich
foreigners who sack, at most,
seven or eight animals during a
typical three-week safari.
Shanin is now headed back to
Africa to film a sequel to African
Safari , which is already a
commercial success and winner of
several international awards.
