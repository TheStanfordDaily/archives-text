# College Unrest
## Seminarians Protest 
### 
Students for the Protestant ministry
were enlisted in the ranks of campus
rebels Monday, occupying t lie
administration building of Union
Theological Seminary in New York City
for 23 hours.
They finally marched out after their
leaders met with the seminary's board
of directors and won an open session of
the board to air their grievances. But
they said they would maintain a
"presence" in the chapel.
About 75 seminarians, mostly white,
acted in support of Negro militant
James Forman's manifesto demanding
payment by religious groups of $500
million in reparations to American
Negroes. A spokesman called the
demonstration interracila.
Union has about 650 students,
among them 14 Negroes, at the
seminary on Broadway and 120 Street
across from Columbia University.
Nearby, City College of New York
was operating under a new president,
Joseph J. Copeland, who said "police
will stay on the campus as long as they
are needed."

Copeland succeeded President Buell
G. Gallagher, who resigned in the
aftermath of three weeks of turmoil,
that included arson. During the day, a
small fire bomb was extinguished in an
empty CCNY classroom before causing
any damage.
CCNY demonstrators have
demanded greater inclusion of Negro
and Puerto Rican students in the
20,000-member student body, which
now includes 4,500 members of
minority races.
As uprisings continued on a number
of other college campuses, Robert H.
Finch, U.S. secretary of health,
education and welfare, warned of a
backlash against student rebels that
could cost them "the things dearest to
their hearts."
In Chicago Monday, five leaders were
arrested in SDS headquarters after a
scuffle, among them Michael Klonsky,
26, national secretary of the society.
They were free in bonds of up to
$5,000 on charges of battery and
interfering with police and firemen.
