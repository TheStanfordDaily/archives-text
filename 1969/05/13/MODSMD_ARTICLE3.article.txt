"visibly and excellently affects the
cultural geography of the U.S." said
Lorenz Eitner, Art Department
Director, at the dedication of the new
$2,425,000 structure yesterday.
The new building, continued Eitner
"ranks, with the facilities at Berkeley
and UCLA, as one of the three
important centers for the study of art in
the West, and as the only privately
controlled institution of its kind and
scope in this part of the country.
"It is in this context that Nathan
Cummings' generous donation, for
which we are deeply grateful, takes on a
significance which transcends the
immediate importance of the new
building for Stanford."
The building was made possible
through a major pledge by Cummings,
Chicago and New York industrialist,
philanthropist, connoisseur, and art
collector. Additional financing was
provided by other private gifts and a
construction grant from the U.S.

Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. Mr. and Mrs. Cummings
attended the Stanford dedication.
The new building, finished ahead of
schedule, has been fully occupied since
the beginning of April. It houses the
18-member teaching faculty of art
historians and artists, about 120
undergraduate art majors, and 40
graduate students in art. In addition,
several hundred Stanford non-art
undergraduate majors meet there for
introductory art history courses.
Eitner said, "Together with our
renovated Museum and growing
collections and with the exhibition
spaces of our Art Gallery, the Nathan
Cummings Art Building gives focus as a
center to draw together creative artists
and historians, art students and aspiring
scholars into one productive
community, set in the heart of
Stanford's larger community of the
humanistic disciplines and sciences."
He emphasized the significance of

regionally strong centers pointing out
"the shortage of trained art historians,
aggravated by their tight concentration
in a small area of the country (the east).
Those attending the dedication also
included President Charles E. Shain of
Connecticut College, Stanford President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, and W. Parmer Fuller
111, president of the Stanford Board of
Trustees.

controlled institution of its kind and
scope in this part of the country.
"It is in this context that Nathan
Cummings' generous donation, for
which we are deeply grateful, takes on a
significance which transcends the
immediate importance of the new
building for Stanford."
The building was made possible
through a major pledge by Cummings,
Chicago and New York industrialist,
philanthropist, connoisseur, and art
collector. Additional financing was
provided by other private gifts and a
construction grant from the U.S.

Department of Health, Education and
Welfare. Mr. and Mrs. Cummings
attended the Stanford dedication.
The new building, finished ahead of
schedule, has been fully occupied since
the beginning of April. It houses the
18-member teaching faculty of art
historians and artists, about 120
undergraduate art majors, and 40
graduate students in art. In addition,
several hundred Stanford non-art
undergraduate majors meet there for
introductory art history courses.
Eitner said, "Together with our
renovated Museum and growing
collections and with the exhibition
spaces of our Art Gallery, the Nathan
Cummings Art Building gives focus as a
center to draw together creative artists
and historians, art students and aspiring
scholars into one productive
community, set in the heart of
Stanford's larger community of the
humanistic disciplines and sciences."
He emphasized the significance of

regionally strong centers pointing out
"the shortage of trained art historians,
aggravated by their tight concentration
in a small area of the country (the east).
Those attending the dedication also
included President Charles E. Shain of
Connecticut College, Stanford President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, and W. Parmer Fuller
111, president of the Stanford Board of
Trustees.
