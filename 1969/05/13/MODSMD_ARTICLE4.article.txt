# In San Francisco Today
## Trustees Meeting On SRI 
### 
Stanford's Board of Trustees meets
today in San Francisco to consider the
future of Stanford Research Institute
(SRI).
The Board's meeting may produce a
decision as to whether or not SRI will
be sold, sold with restrictions or
brought under closer control of the
University.

The April 3rd Movement, which has
been spearheading the drive to bring
SRI under closer community control
and demanding an end to CBW,
counterinsurgency and war-related
research there, has urged the Trustees to
"respond to the community's wishes."
The Academic Senate last week
recommended to the Trustees that they
make a preliminary decision today, but
withhold any final action until next fall.
They also asked the Trustees to
continue the moratorium on chemical
and biological warfare contracts
imposed last month.
The Council of Presidents—Barry
Askinas, John Grube, Joyce Kobayashi,
and Pat Shea—said they planned to give
the Trustees a proposal to restructure
SRI into a research university within the
Stanford community "over a period of
years." Circulated in draft form to the
Trustees, the proposal calls for creation
of a "sister institution" able to seek
endowment funds and, in time, make
tenured appointments.
It also advocates a joint committee
on research policy guidelines, composed
of equal representation from the

University and SRI. An autonomous
"Senate of Professionals" elected at SRI
would have powers comparable to those
of the Senate of the Academic Council
at the University. In a May 2 resolution,
the Senate said it was ready to form a
conference committee with elected
representatives of SRl's professlbnal
staff "to consider research objectives
and policies at both institutions," in the
event University-SRI ties continue.
"The orientation of SRI toward the
amelioration of war, disease, racism,
pollution, and overpopulation is a
worthy and attainable goal," the
Council of Presidents said. "It can be
achieved without resorting to
destructive force."
The Board's meeting, which is closed
except to invited guests, includes 10
a.m., noon and 2 p.m. sessions. A
decision may be made in the afternoon
session following the presentation of
various alternatives.
The meeting is being held in the
Pacific Mutual Life Building, 600
California Ave. in San Francisco. The
April 3rd Movement has no plans to
picket or disrupt the meeting.

would have powers comparable to those
of the Senate of the Academic Council
at the University. In a May 2 resolution,
the Senate said it was ready to form a
conference committee with elected
representatives of SRl's professlbnal
staff "to consider research objectives
and policies at both institutions," in the
event University-SRI ties continue.
"The orientation of SRI toward the
amelioration of war, disease, racism,
pollution, and overpopulation is a
worthy and attainable goal," the
Council of Presidents said. "It can be
achieved without resorting to
destructive force."
The Board's meeting, which is closed
except to invited guests, includes 10
a.m., noon and 2 p.m. sessions. A
decision may be made in the afternoon
session following the presentation of
various alternatives.
The meeting is being held in the
Pacific Mutual Life Building, 600
California Ave. in San Francisco. The
April 3rd Movement has no plans to
picket or disrupt the meeting.
