# Professors, Students To Sponsor Meetings
## 
### 
The AAUP and the ASSU Council of
Presidents will sponsor student-faculty
discussion groups Wednesday evening in
different dormitories and faculty

residences on campus. The purpose is to
discuss the decisions that come out of
the meeting of the board of Trustees
and how these will affect the campus
for the remainder of the quarter.
The names of the faculty who will
visit dormitories and a list of faculty
homes that will be open Wednesday
evening will appear in the Daily
tomorrow. Those wishing to visit
faculty homes are requested to sign a
list in the ASSU office before four p.m.
Wednesday.
Council of Presidents member John
Grube said, "We hope that these
meetings will be able to constructively
utilize and sustain the interest that has
been generated among the student body
and the faculty this quarter. Next year
will be a critical period of transition and
we need to maintain the momentum
achieved this spring."
