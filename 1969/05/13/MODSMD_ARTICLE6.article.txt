# Movement Awaits Trustees' Action
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Small "affinity-group" discussions on
appropriate responses to whatever
action is taken by the Trustees at their
meeting will highlight today's boycott
of classes called by the April 3rd
Movement to show support for their
demands.
Picketing, an informal noon meeting,
music by the Motherlode Blues band,
and guerilla theater skits are also
scheduled for this second-day of the
two-day boycott.
In addition to the open group
discussions beginning at 3:30 this
afternoon around the A3M's geodesic
dome outside Tresidder, members of the
Movement have been requested to
organize dinner discussions in
dormitories.
Cars will be leaving at 3:00 p.m.
from the Tresidder parking lot for the
meeting in San Francisco.
More than 1000 students
participated in yesterday's political
carnival on White Plaza consisting of a
series of political games.
These included "Hit the Heavies,"
where students threw tennis balls at
targets representing the Board of
Trustees, and "Smash the State," where
three sledge hammer blows on a used
car sold for 25c.
The ASM estimated attendance on
the first day of the boycott in large
humanities and social sciences classes at
about 40% normal while classes in the
sciences had attendance of about7o% of
normal. In classes having mid-term
examinations, the attendance was about
100%.
In Economics I, however, with an
enrollment of 300 students and an
average attendance of about 250, only
60 to 70 students appeared in class
yesterday morning.
The boycott has been supported by
18 more faculty, for a total of 47, from
19 departments who cancelled their

classes today as well as yesterday.
Among the additional members who
signed a petition that was circulated last
Friday and over the weekend are Peter
S. Stern, history; Paul S. Seaver, history;
David M. Kennedy, history; Ruth S.
Day, psychology; Karel Deleeyw,
mathematics; Joseph Paff, political
science; Paul Robinson, history; Martin
A. Miller, history; Elinor Kaplan,
psychology; Phillip Bertocci, history;
and Robert Floyd, Computer Science.
Another expression of solidarity
came from the current group at
Stanford-in-Austria which voted 53-18
to boycott Monday classes. Their
decision to boycott was made before a
similar vote was taken on the Palo Alto
campus.
The use of the public address system
and amplified electric guitars during
yesterday's activities on White Plaza
resulted in the disruption of several
classes, according to David Swift,
student financial manager. The
mechanical engineering specifically
complained about the noise.
As a result, Swift announced that the
existing regulation which states that all
programs on White Plaza containing
which states that all programs on White
Plaza containing amplified sound must
be held during noon to 1 p.m. or after
4:30 p.m. would be enforced today.
Another protest to the carnival
occurred whn Professor John McCarthy,
computer science, tore down a wheel of
fortune that predicted how the faculty
would act during the present week.
The wheel was painted yellow
reportedly to symbolize faculty
cowardice, while "expression concern"
was predominantly mentioned in the
choices of responses.
McCarthy said that he was offended
by the insult to the faculty and
explained, "I think the faculty in many
issues is undecided, but I think the
accusation of cowardice is unfair."

Another expression of solidarity
came from the current group at
Stanford-in-Austria which voted 53-18
to boycott Monday classes. Their
decision to boycott was made before a
similar vote was taken on the Palo Alto
campus.
The use of the public address system
and amplified electric guitars during
yesterday's activities on White Plaza
resulted in the disruption of several
classes, according to David Swift,
student financial manager. The
mechanical engineering specifically
complained about the noise.
As a result, Swift announced that the
existing regulation which states that all
programs on White Plaza containing
which states that all programs on White
Plaza containing amplified sound must
be held during noon to 1 p.m. or after
4:30 p.m. would be enforced today.
Another protest to the carnival
occurred whn Professor John McCarthy,
computer science, tore down a wheel of
fortune that predicted how the faculty
would act during the present week.
The wheel was painted yellow
reportedly to symbolize faculty
cowardice, while "expression concern"
was predominantly mentioned in the
choices of responses.
McCarthy said that he was offended
by the insult to the faculty and
explained, "I think the faculty in many
issues is undecided, but I think the
accusation of cowardice is unfair."

CAMPUS CARNIVAL—One of the highlights of the two-day class boycott has been the
Carnival on White Plaza organized by the April 3rd Movement. The Carnival will continue
today with exhibits on the Trustees as well as games for all concerned.
Small "affinity-group" discussions on
appropriate responses to whatever
action is taken by the Trustees at their
meeting will highlight today's boycott
of classes called by the April 3rd
Movement to show support for their
demands.
Picketing, an informal noon meeting,
music by the Motherlode Blues band,
and guerilla theater skits are also
scheduled for this second-day of the
two-day boycott.
In addition to the open group
discussions beginning at 3:30 this
afternoon around the A3M's geodesic
dome outside Tresidder, members of the
Movement have been requested to
organize dinner discussions in
dormitories.
Cars will be leaving at 3:00 p.m.
from the Tresidder parking lot for the
meeting in San Francisco.
More than 1000 students
participated in yesterday's political
carnival on White Plaza consisting of a
series of political games.
These included "Hit the Heavies,"
where students threw tennis balls at
targets representing the Board of
Trustees, and "Smash the State," where
three sledge hammer blows on a used
car sold for 25c.
The ASM estimated attendance on
the first day of the boycott in large
humanities and social sciences classes at
about 40% normal while classes in the
sciences had attendance of about7o% of
normal. In classes having mid-term
examinations, the attendance was about
100%.
In Economics I, however, with an
enrollment of 300 students and an
average attendance of about 250, only
60 to 70 students appeared in class
yesterday morning.
The boycott has been supported by
18 more faculty, for a total of 47, from
19 departments who cancelled their

classes today as well as yesterday.
Among the additional members who
signed a petition that was circulated last
Friday and over the weekend are Peter
S. Stern, history; Paul S. Seaver, history;
David M. Kennedy, history; Ruth S.
Day, psychology; Karel Deleeyw,
mathematics; Joseph Paff, political
science; Paul Robinson, history; Martin
A. Miller, history; Elinor Kaplan,
psychology; Phillip Bertocci, history;
