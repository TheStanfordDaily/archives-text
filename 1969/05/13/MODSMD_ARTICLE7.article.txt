# Legislature Adjourns For Lack Of Quorum
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
Student Legislature Speaker Yale
Braunstein showed up at last night's
special session of LASSU and
immediately adjourned it for lack of a
quorum.
Forty-seven members signed the roll
before the informally called committee
of the whole adjourned, with initiators
of the petition for the meeting vowing
to return to the regular meeting this
Thursday.
"The meeting was illegally called, but
we decided to give them the benefit of
the doubt and held the meeting
anyway," Braunstein declared as he
stood outside room 320. Attired in red,
white and blue flowered surfer's "jams,"
he drew scattered jeers from the
students on hand for last night's
meeting as he left.
Tony Maran, a graduate student in
electrical engineering and one of the
students who circulated a petition
signed by 65 students, chaired the
informal session afterwards. He
explained that the proposed agenda for
last night's meeting would be submitted
Thursday as an amendment to the
orders of the day.
The meeting became somewhat
heated as some LASSU members
questioned the legitimacy of the session.
"You didn't have your lackeys here
tonight," Owen Blank, a junior in
political science and economics from
Soto House, shouted to Maran.
Braunstein announced that the
finance committee will resume their
hearings on the budget tonight. The

group will be considering next year's l
appropriations.
"What intrigues me the most is that
these LASSU members are the same
students who claim that others must not
attack the system," Braunstein said last
night. "They never submitted any items
for the agenda nor their supposed
petition."
Included in material handed out at
last night's meeting were open letters
from three students attack the lack of
balance of political perspectives on the
Committee on Nominations. The body
has the final voice in those students
named by LASSU to all committees.
The proposed agenda, a resolution
asking for nominations to be opened to
replace Ben Wootten, Fay Armstrong,
and Pat McMahon by three students
who will serve until next April. If no
action is taken by the 30th of this
month, the Speaker of the Legislature is
empowered to name the members.
James Galloway, a graduate student,
accused Wootten and Armstrong of
directing "barbed comments and
argument" against those students
supporting sale of SRI who wanted to
testify before the board of trustees.
"If the committee on nominations is
itself composed largely of individuals of
a single political persuasion, more
importantly individuals who will abuse
their position and responsibility in order
to advance their own political causes,
then what hope is there for the
committees they nominate?" asked grad
student William Rhodes in another
letter.

"If the committee on nominations is
itself composed largely of individuals of
a single political persuasion, more
importantly individuals who will abuse
their position and responsibility in order
to advance their own political causes,
then what hope is there for the
committees they nominate?" asked grad
student William Rhodes in another
letter.
Student Legislature Speaker Yale
Braunstein showed up at last night's
special session of LASSU and
immediately adjourned it for lack of a
quorum.
Forty-seven members signed the roll
before the informally called committee
of the whole adjourned, with initiators
of the petition for the meeting vowing
to return to the regular meeting this
Thursday.
"The meeting was illegally called, but
we decided to give them the benefit of
the doubt and held the meeting
anyway," Braunstein declared as he
stood outside room 320. Attired in red,
white and blue flowered surfer's "jams,"
he drew scattered jeers from the
students on hand for last night's
meeting as he left.
Tony Maran, a graduate student in
electrical engineering and one of the
students who circulated a petition
signed by 65 students, chaired the
informal session afterwards. He
explained that the proposed agenda for
last night's meeting would be submitted
Thursday as an amendment to the
orders of the day.
The meeting became somewhat
heated as some LASSU members
questioned the legitimacy of the session.
"You didn't have your lackeys here
tonight," Owen Blank, a junior in
political science and economics from
Soto House, shouted to Maran.
Braunstein announced that the
finance committee will resume their
hearings on the budget tonight. The

group will be considering next year's l
appropriations.
"What intrigues me the most is that
these LASSU members are the same
students who claim that others must not
attack the system," Braunstein said last
night. "They never submitted any items
for the agenda nor their supposed
petition."
Included in material handed out at
last night's meeting were open letters
from three students attack the lack of
balance of political perspectives on the
Committee on Nominations. The body
has the final voice in those students
named by LASSU to all committees.
The proposed agenda, a resolution
asking for nominations to be opened to
replace Ben Wootten, Fay Armstrong,
and Pat McMahon by three students
who will serve until next April. If no
action is taken by the 30th of this
month, the Speaker of the Legislature is
empowered to name the members.
James Galloway, a graduate student,
accused Wootten and Armstrong of
directing "barbed comments and
argument" against those students
supporting sale of SRI who wanted to
testify before the board of trustees.
