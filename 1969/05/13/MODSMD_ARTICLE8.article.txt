## Bill Wyman 'Up Against The Wall' 
### SUSAN SWARD 
Bill Wyman, the Associate Dean of
Students, is an administrator up against
the wall.
There are many students at Stanford
who hold Wymen in the highest regard,
but within the last year he has received
a lot of negative feedback from radical
students who charge him with being a
"name-taker" for the administration
during sit-ins.
Wyman, who first came to Stanford
as a T.A. in the English Department in
1961, has been Associate Dean of
Students for two years. Next year he
plans to do some teaching and to work
on some special projects with President
Pitzer.
Over the past two years Dean Wyman
has tried to translate students' concerns
into the kind of language that will speak
to the University administration, the
Board of Trustees and the society at
large. From Wyman's vantage point,
students have many dissatisfactions that
are valid and that represent the
difficulty which students have today in
resolving what we say our society is and
what in fact it has become.
Complaint Department
In recent years Wyman feels that the
Dean's Office at Stanford has become a
complaint department. Working in the
Dean's Office, an individual finds
himself responding to complaints so

often that he doesn't have time to
contribute to the betterment of the
academic structure of the University.
Ideally, Wyman sees the Dean's
Office as the provider of an intellectual
mileu on the campus. This intellectual
mileu should be composed of an
atmosphere where the accepted
objective to strive for is objective,
rational thought.
Though such an atmosphere may
represent the ideal set-up in Dean
Wyman's eyes, he is very quick to admit
that this is not an era of rationality.
Instead, an atmosphere exists on college
campuses today that is damaging to the
academic community: this atmosphere
is one of religious fervor.
Intelligence Only Hope
Wyman's conceptualization of the
role of the Dean's Office grows out of
his view of the University's role in
society. The only hope for man is his
intelligence, Wyman contends, and the
University provides a place where
intellectual life can be cherished and
honored.
As American universities have
become engaged in applied research,
they have corrupted themselves to some
extent. For any time an institution
engages in applied work, it runs the
danger of serving a special interest
group. Hence, the work that the medical
school does is more acceptable to the

university community at large than the
work that the business school does, for
example.
Social Critic?
Does Wyman see the University as a
social critic?
The University should be the
foremost critic of the society, Wyman
feels, but he does not think that it is the
University's business to apply the
changes that the criticism isolates as
necessary. In the 1970's and 80's
Wyman envisions a trend away from
applied procedures and toward more
pure, intellectual pursuits at university
campuses across the nation.
The Associate Dean's concept of the
ideal role for the faculty and
administration ties into his over-view of
the University in society. Both faculty
and administrators are ideally supposed
to be striving toward a better academic
system. Administrators should be
freeing the faculty and students for the
closest engagement possible in
intellectual life. Faculty should be
working toward making the University a
truly intellectual procedure.
Much of the criticism of the Dean's
Office over the last year has revolved
around its support of the judicial system
at Stanford—the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC)—which tries students for
offenses committed on campus. Wyman
supports the S.IC because he feels that it

is important that the University govern
itself.
"Bizarre Behavior"
"The outside community would not
tolerate the bizarre behavior that is
almost standard in a university
community," Wyman said. "We want to
be able to embrace all actions that don't
infringe on the rights of others to have
ideas and to do their scholarship."

during sit-ins.
Wyman, who first came to Stanford
as a T.A. in the English Department in
1961, has been Associate Dean of
Students for two years. Next year he
plans to do some teaching and to work
on some special projects with President
Pitzer.
Over the past two years Dean Wyman
has tried to translate students' concerns
into the kind of language that will speak
to the University administration, the
Board of Trustees and the society at
large. From Wyman's vantage point,
students have many dissatisfactions that
are valid and that represent the
difficulty which students have today in
resolving what we say our society is and
what in fact it has become.
Complaint Department
In recent years Wyman feels that the
Dean's Office at Stanford has become a
complaint department. Working in the
Dean's Office, an individual finds
himself responding to complaints so

often that he doesn't have time to
contribute to the betterment of the
academic structure of the University.
Ideally, Wyman sees the Dean's
Office as the provider of an intellectual
mileu on the campus. This intellectual
mileu should be composed of an
atmosphere where the accepted
objective to strive for is objective,
rational thought.
Though such an atmosphere may
represent the ideal set-up in Dean
Wyman's eyes, he is very quick to admit
that this is not an era of rationality.
Instead, an atmosphere exists on college
campuses today that is damaging to the
academic community: this atmosphere
is one of religious fervor.
Intelligence Only Hope
Wyman's conceptualization of the
role of the Dean's Office grows out of
his view of the University's role in
society. The only hope for man is his
intelligence, Wyman contends, and the
University provides a place where
intellectual life can be cherished and
honored.
As American universities have
become engaged in applied research,
they have corrupted themselves to some
extent. For any time an institution
engages in applied work, it runs the
danger of serving a special interest
group. Hence, the work that the medical
school does is more acceptable to the

university community at large than the
work that the business school does, for
example.
Social Critic?
Does Wyman see the University as a
social critic?
The University should be the
foremost critic of the society, Wyman
feels, but he does not think that it is the
University's business to apply the
changes that the criticism isolates as
necessary. In the 1970's and 80's
Wyman envisions a trend away from
applied procedures and toward more
pure, intellectual pursuits at university
campuses across the nation.
The Associate Dean's concept of the
ideal role for the faculty and
administration ties into his over-view of
the University in society. Both faculty
and administrators are ideally supposed
to be striving toward a better academic
system. Administrators should be
freeing the faculty and students for the
closest engagement possible in
intellectual life. Faculty should be
working toward making the University a
truly intellectual procedure.
Much of the criticism of the Dean's
Office over the last year has revolved
around its support of the judicial system
at Stanford—the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC)—which tries students for
offenses committed on campus. Wyman
supports the S.IC because he feels that it

is important that the University govern
itself.
"Bizarre Behavior"
"The outside community would not
tolerate the bizarre behavior that is
almost standard in a university
community," Wyman said. "We want to
be able to embrace all actions that don't
infringe on the rights of others to have
ideas and to do their scholarship."
