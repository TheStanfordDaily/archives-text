The summer Stanford Daily is a very hot medium. It appears twice a week during sum
mer session and can be published from whatever location the editor desires. The above
picture captures one possibility.
The editor needn't be limited to Lake Lagunita. The opportunity to make a large
profit and travel widely is immense. The problem in past summers has been too much
advertising—local banks couldn't handle the editor's account.
This year there is a special problem—there is no editor yet. Journalistic experience
is a must and a good business sense is imperative. The job begins in late June and ends
in mid-August. For information, contact Phil Taubman at 321-2300 x 4632 or stop by
The Daily office today or tomorrow.
The summer medium beckons.
