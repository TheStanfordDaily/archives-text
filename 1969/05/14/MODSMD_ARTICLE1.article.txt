# Trustees To Terminate SRI Relationship
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The Stanford Board of Trustees
meeting in San Francisco yesterday, said
that they believe the formal ties
between the Stanford Research Institute
and the University should be
terminated.
The decision contained in a carefully
worded five page document said that a
resolution of the matter would be
undertaken "at the earliest date
consistent with the difficulty of the
problem" and that qualified outside
counsel would be sought.
Meeting Today
There was no immediate reaction
from the April 3 Movement but a
meeting has been called today at 1 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium to discuss
possible responses to the Trustees
decision.
In its statement, adopted
unanimously, the Trustees said that "to
affiliate the Institute more closely with
the University, as many advocate, would
embark Stanford upon a program of
applied contract research in manner and
scale completely foreign to our concept
of an education institution of high
quality."
They added that "the Institute as a
viable organization would disintegrate

and its highly skilled personnel be
dissipated."
In an obvious reference to the
demands of the April 3 Movement the
statement said that "the Trustees must
take the long view; they must stop short
of the point at which they would betray
or jeopardize the future in order to
achieve momentary tranquility by
placating those who urge a particular
course of action upon them."
The Trustees, who also serve as
members of SRI, "wholeheartedly
endorsed" a ban against research
projects "dealing directly with the
developments of weapons of biological
or chemical warfare" enacted by the
Executive Committee of the SRI Board
of Directors.
Not Feasible
In the area of counter-insurgency the
statement said that "limitations upon
research policy under this hearing are
neither feasible nor desirable. Discussion
on this topic by the Seante of the
Academic Council have indicated the
difficulty inherent in defining
limitations on this kind of research."
"Stanford is already far too short of
financial resources and administrative
manpower in our opinion to embark on
what would in effect be a major new

venture—an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity."
The statement said that "there are
matters of urgent social concern within
this country which should be the
objects of vigorous research attack and
activity by society in general."
Social Problems
"To the extent that the social
problems of the day are appropriate
targets for University research activities,
then programs should be devised within
the University structure itself,
consistent with Stanford's financial
capacity and with its educational
objectives rather than by merging a
different kind of institution into the
Stanford setting for the purpose of
furthering social research, with all of the
financial risks to the University and
damage to skilled SRI personnel
attendant thereon."
The meeting held on the ninth floor
of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance
Company on California Street, broke up
about 6 p.m. W. Parmer Fuller,
chairman of the board, read the
statement to the press while Dan
DeYoung, Assistant Business Manager
for the University, read the statement to
a small group of students assembled in
the hall outside the meeting room.
Earlier in the day ASSU President
Pat Shea and Roulette Smith, a
member ' of the President Advisory
Committee, addressed the Board. Shea
spoke on behalf of the students while
Smith answered questions about his
proposal for making SRI into a research
university.
Reaction among student government
officials to the Trustees' statement was
swift. The Council of Presidents issued a
statement saying that, "Today the
Board of Trustees as it is presently
constituted signed its own death
warrant. By its unwillingness to listen
and examine potentially creative ideas
related to SRI the Board demonstrated
its collective inadequacy and isolation.
"Men who know little of universities
and education should not be making

final decisions for this institution. The
action taken by the Trustees today
commits us to defining a new system of
University governance.
"We feel that no action that students
might take within the University can
change that decision. The question then
becomes how can the objectionable
research at Stanford Research Institute
be halted? We must now focus the
community's attention on SRI and its
activities."
The just abolished, but still alive,
student legislature will meet
tonight to consider a resolution
urging the immediate resignation
of the members of the Board.
The resolution sponsored by
Ellen Mahoney, Bill Evers and
Patrick McMahon says that
"Wheras the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University
has arrogantly resisted any
attempts to engage in rational
dialogue with the Stanford
community and whereas their
actions reflect total lack of
understanding of the events and
of the mood of the community,
be it resolved that the legislature
of the associated students of
Stanford University condemns the
Board and calls for the immediate
resignation of the members of the
Board "

statement saying that, "Today the
Board of Trustees as it is presently
constituted signed its own death

related to SRI the Board demonstrated
its collective inadequacy and isolation.
"Men who know little of universities

ON THE WAY-Defendants walk to Superior Court to challenge tlie restraining order issued
against Movement members two weeks ago.
The Stanford Board of Trustees
meeting in San Francisco yesterday, said
that they believe the formal ties
between the Stanford Research Institute
and the University should be
terminated.
The decision contained in a carefully
worded five page document said that a
resolution of the matter would be
undertaken "at the earliest date
consistent with the difficulty of the
problem" and that qualified outside
counsel would be sought.
Meeting Today
There was no immediate reaction
from the April 3 Movement but a
meeting has been called today at 1 p.m.
in Memorial Auditorium to discuss
possible responses to the Trustees
decision.
In its statement, adopted
unanimously, the Trustees said that "to
affiliate the Institute more closely with
the University, as many advocate, would
embark Stanford upon a program of
applied contract research in manner and
scale completely foreign to our concept
of an education institution of high
quality."
They added that "the Institute as a
viable organization would disintegrate

and its highly skilled personnel be
dissipated."
In an obvious reference to the
demands of the April 3 Movement the
statement said that "the Trustees must
take the long view; they must stop short
of the point at which they would betray
or jeopardize the future in order to
achieve momentary tranquility by
placating those who urge a particular
course of action upon them."
The Trustees, who also serve as
members of SRI, "wholeheartedly
endorsed" a ban against research
projects "dealing directly with the
developments of weapons of biological
or chemical warfare" enacted by the
Executive Committee of the SRI Board
of Directors.
Not Feasible
In the area of counter-insurgency the
statement said that "limitations upon
research policy under this hearing are
neither feasible nor desirable. Discussion
on this topic by the Seante of the
Academic Council have indicated the
difficulty inherent in defining
limitations on this kind of research."
"Stanford is already far too short of
financial resources and administrative
manpower in our opinion to embark on
what would in effect be a major new

venture—an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity."
The statement said that "there are
matters of urgent social concern within
this country which should be the
objects of vigorous research attack and
activity by society in general."
Social Problems
"To the extent that the social
problems of the day are appropriate
targets for University research activities,
then programs should be devised within
the University structure itself,
consistent with Stanford's financial
capacity and with its educational
objectives rather than by merging a
different kind of institution into the
Stanford setting for the purpose of
furthering social research, with all of the
financial risks to the University and
damage to skilled SRI personnel
attendant thereon."
The meeting held on the ninth floor
of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance
Company on California Street, broke up
about 6 p.m. W. Parmer Fuller,
chairman of the board, read the
statement to the press while Dan
DeYoung, Assistant Business Manager
for the University, read the statement to
a small group of students assembled in
the hall outside the meeting room.
Earlier in the day ASSU President
Pat Shea and Roulette Smith, a
member ' of the President Advisory
Committee, addressed the Board. Shea
spoke on behalf of the students while
Smith answered questions about his
proposal for making SRI into a research
university.

what would in effect be a major new

venture—an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity."
The statement said that "there are
matters of urgent social concern within
this country which should be the
objects of vigorous research attack and
activity by society in general."
Social Problems
"To the extent that the social
problems of the day are appropriate
targets for University research activities,
then programs should be devised within
the University structure itself,
consistent with Stanford's financial
capacity and with its educational
objectives rather than by merging a
different kind of institution into the
Stanford setting for the purpose of
furthering social research, with all of the
financial risks to the University and
damage to skilled SRI personnel
attendant thereon."
The meeting held on the ninth floor
of the Pacific Mutual Life Insurance
Company on California Street, broke up
about 6 p.m. W. Parmer Fuller,
chairman of the board, read the
statement to the press while Dan
DeYoung, Assistant Business Manager
for the University, read the statement to
a small group of students assembled in
the hall outside the meeting room.
Earlier in the day ASSU President
Pat Shea and Roulette Smith, a
member ' of the President Advisory
Committee, addressed the Board. Shea
spoke on behalf of the students while
Smith answered questions about his
proposal for making SRI into a research
university.
Reaction among student government
officials to the Trustees' statement was
swift. The Council of Presidents issued a
statement saying that, "Today the
Board of Trustees as it is presently
constituted signed its own death
warrant. By its unwillingness to listen
and examine potentially creative ideas
related to SRI the Board demonstrated
its collective inadequacy and isolation.
"Men who know little of universities
and education should not be making

final decisions for this institution. The
action taken by the Trustees today
commits us to defining a new system of
University governance.
"We feel that no action that students
might take within the University can
change that decision. The question then
becomes how can the objectionable
research at Stanford Research Institute
be halted? We must now focus the
community's attention on SRI and its
activities."
The just abolished, but still alive,
student legislature will meet
tonight to consider a resolution
urging the immediate resignation
of the members of the Board.
The resolution sponsored by
Ellen Mahoney, Bill Evers and
Patrick McMahon says that
"Wheras the Board of Trustees of
Leland Stanford Junior University
has arrogantly resisted any
attempts to engage in rational
dialogue with the Stanford
community and whereas their
actions reflect total lack of
understanding of the events and
of the mood of the community,
be it resolved that the legislature
of the associated students of
Stanford University condemns the
Board and calls for the immediate
resignation of the members of the
Board "
