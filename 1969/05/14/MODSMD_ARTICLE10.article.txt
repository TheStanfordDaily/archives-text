# Decision By Trustees Gets Mixed Reaction
## 
### 
The Stanford community's reaction
to the Board of Trustees' decision that
the University sever all relations with
SRI was one of weary resignation.
Student reactions paralled the words
of one political science major, "How,"
he asked, "could the Trustees ignore
their two basic constituencies and listen
instead to the SRI researchers?"
According to President Pitzer, "The
Board found the desires and demands
from the different constituencies to be
completely irreconciable.
"I think," he continued, "that the
board came to a reasonable decision.

that the University in its educational
and basic research activities was a
separate sort of operation from the
applied research done at SRI.
"There was not a convincing case for
an amalgamation of the University with
SRI. I don't think there was a
convincing case presented for the closer
coupling of the two.
"I pushed essentially in direction
of a resolution which called for a
statement of preliminary resolution but
not an absolutely irrevocable decision.
President of SRI Charles A.
Anderson stated that he viewed the
Trustees' action as "sound and
appropriate." Their decision yesterday
made it clear that the Trustees would
seek no restrictive covenant to limit SRI
research activities.
Professor William Baxter of the law
school echoed that "the Trustees are
moving in the direction that seemed to
me almost inevitable if major damage
was not be be done to both
institutions."
Other respected faculty members
expressed disappointment with the
outcome of Tuesday's meeting: "It's
come to a sad realityâ€”that no matter
how concerned students are, the
Trustees operate out of a different
framework. They are concerned with
making money for the University. This
is probably a wise business venture . . .1
only wish that the Trustees had
designated areas that the SRI money
will go to."
Chairman of the Committee for New
Politics, Dave Jones was more
outspoken. "This underlies the basic
illegitimacy of the Board of Trustees,"
he said.
