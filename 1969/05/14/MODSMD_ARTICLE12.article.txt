The Stanford Board of Trustees said
yesterday, "There are matters of urgent
social concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous research
attack and activity by society in general.
Stanford University and SRI should be in
the forefront of the efforts to find
solutions to these problems and the
trustees pledge themselves to encourage
such efforts and to seek support for them."
In the same statement, the Board
announced that "formal ties between the
Institute (SRI) and the University should
be terminated." Furthermore, the Trustees
said they, "are of the opinion that they
should not impose restrictions on the areas
of research to be conducted at SRI."
The conflict between idea and action is
bewildering and discouraging, if not
infuriating. Once again, the trustees have
indicated that their priorities and
judgements are maddeningly insensitive to
the needs of this world and its population.
To be very specific the Board
recommends:
•That SRI be severed from the
University.
• That no restrictions on SRI research be
imposed, other than a cutoff of chemical
biological warfare work.
•That consideration of a cutback on
counterinsurgency work is "neither feasible
nor desirable."
•That SRI alone set up a review board
to examine its research practices.
Looked upon as a whole, the
recommendations do anything but
"encourage" efforts to solve crucial social
problems. In fact, the trustee decisions may
make SRI more socially unacceptable than
at present.
By severing SRI from the University, the
trustees are refusing to turn SRI into an
institution which will creatively aid in
society's business of peaceful and
productive activities. Instead, SRI will
remain linked to the business of war.
Moreover the trustees felt that
limitations on counterinsurgency research
were undesirable. As trustee William
Hewlett once pointed out, Stanford and its
affiliates are American institutions.

Counterinsurgency is part of American
policy.
The trustees suggested internal research
review mechanisms for SRI. If we can
believe the poll of the SRI staff,
eighty-four percent have enjoyed life with
the military-industrial complex. Asking
them to set up a review board is like asking
Lucifer to watch his step. The majority of
the SRI staff endorses the present policy
on national security research.
Students wanted an end to war and
counterinsurgency research. They got from
the trustees a guarantee that it will
continue.
The trustees talk about concern for
national goals, but their actions promise us
more of the same discredited national
policies. The trustees of Stanford refuse to
do what they could to deny the war
machine the energy it needs to operate.
They have nc t only failed to do something
creative with SRI, but they have also failed
to stop SRI from doing work which is bad.
The questions of the past month have
been answered by the trustees. They have
spoken. The debate now moves to
response. How should the campus react?
Can it realistically do anything to change
the decision, or, failing that, make trustee
plans inoperative?
The clearest way to sabatoge the trustee
decision is to render impotent the prospect
of selling SRI. How?
People may argue today that action such
as seizing a building on campus is more
desirable than striking at SRI itself because
the University shields students from brutal
police.
But can anything less than complete
destruction of SRI facilities have the
impact desired by some? Yes.
Two or three thousand students and
faculty in a non-violent sit-down and
protest demonstration in front of SRl—like
the "Stop The Draft" week in October
'67—is a far more measured idea and has
greater potential for success.
We hope Stanford has not reached the
level where violence, like that at Columbia
last spring, is an accepted part of our lives.

the decision, or, failing that, make trustee
plans inoperative?
The clearest way to sabatoge the trustee
decision is to render impotent the prospect
of selling SRI. How?
People may argue today that action such
as seizing a building on campus is more
desirable than striking at SRI itself because
the University shields students from brutal
police.
But can anything less than complete
destruction of SRI facilities have the
impact desired by some? Yes.
Two or three thousand students and
faculty in a non-violent sit-down and
protest demonstration in front of SRl—like
the "Stop The Draft" week in October
'67—is a far more measured idea and has
greater potential for success.
We hope Stanford has not reached the
level where violence, like that at Columbia
last spring, is an accepted part of our lives.
The Stanford Board of Trustees said
yesterday, "There are matters of urgent
social concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous research
attack and activity by society in general.
Stanford University and SRI should be in
the forefront of the efforts to find
solutions to these problems and the
trustees pledge themselves to encourage
such efforts and to seek support for them."
In the same statement, the Board
announced that "formal ties between the
Institute (SRI) and the University should
be terminated." Furthermore, the Trustees
said they, "are of the opinion that they
should not impose restrictions on the areas
of research to be conducted at SRI."
The conflict between idea and action is
bewildering and discouraging, if not
infuriating. Once again, the trustees have
indicated that their priorities and
judgements are maddeningly insensitive to
the needs of this world and its population.
To be very specific the Board
recommends:
•That SRI be severed from the
University.
• That no restrictions on SRI research be
imposed, other than a cutoff of chemical
biological warfare work.
•That consideration of a cutback on
counterinsurgency work is "neither feasible
nor desirable."
•That SRI alone set up a review board
to examine its research practices.
Looked upon as a whole, the
recommendations do anything but
"encourage" efforts to solve crucial social
problems. In fact, the trustee decisions may
make SRI more socially unacceptable than
at present.
By severing SRI from the University, the
trustees are refusing to turn SRI into an
institution which will creatively aid in
society's business of peaceful and
productive activities. Instead, SRI will
remain linked to the business of war.
Moreover the trustees felt that
limitations on counterinsurgency research
were undesirable. As trustee William
Hewlett once pointed out, Stanford and its
affiliates are American institutions.

Counterinsurgency is part of American
policy.
The trustees suggested internal research
review mechanisms for SRI. If we can
believe the poll of the SRI staff,
eighty-four percent have enjoyed life with
the military-industrial complex. Asking
them to set up a review board is like asking
Lucifer to watch his step. The majority of
the SRI staff endorses the present policy
on national security research.
Students wanted an end to war and
counterinsurgency research. They got from
the trustees a guarantee that it will
continue.
The trustees talk about concern for
national goals, but their actions promise us
more of the same discredited national
policies. The trustees of Stanford refuse to
do what they could to deny the war
machine the energy it needs to operate.
They have nc t only failed to do something
creative with SRI, but they have also failed
to stop SRI from doing work which is bad.
The questions of the past month have
been answered by the trustees. They have
spoken. The debate now moves to
response. How should the campus react?
Can it realistically do anything to change
the decision, or, failing that, make trustee
plans inoperative?
