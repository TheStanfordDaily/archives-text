# Dear Mom
## A 						Colorful Bar-Mitzpah 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
What are those big colorful
tents for in front of Tresidder
Union?
Curious
Dear Curious,
It's a bar-mitzpah.
Religiously,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I am so bewildered by the
campus politics. Could you define
and summarize the different
viewpoints?
Apolitical
Dear Apolitical,
Basically there are three
camps: 1) the Kamikaze liberals
who wish to raze the University,
plow under its buildings, and then
salt the earth on which it stood.
Second, are the conservatives who
want to return to "reason" and
"Civilized" behavior which means
they want the liberals burnt,
drawn and quartered, and their
remains suspended in iron cages in
Main Quad. Third are the
moderates who are equally
attracted to both propositions and
are consequently in a catatonic
state of indecision and inaction.
Love,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I don't quite know what's
wrong with me. I'm a complete
misfit here at Stanford. No matter
how hard I try, I find my required
reading interesting. Speaking
French seems like fun to me.
Lately, I've lost control, and have
been doing ex Ira reading in my
major. Is there are hope for me?
Intellectually yours,
M isfit

Dear Misfit,
The admissions office does slip
up once in a while and lets in a
scholar rather than a good
student. Usually they are weeded
out and refused admission
for being "some kind of a
screwball." If it is any consolation
to you, there is another scholar in
classics and rumor has it that
there is one in the poly sci
department, although the
department denies it vehemently.
There are several alternatives
for you: The really important
point here is that you not reveal
this perverted interest in your
studies (especially to your
professors who wouldn't believe
it, anyhow, and would think you
were apple polishing.) In other
words, it's all right to be a scholar,
just so you hide it.
Try the following suggestions:
First, laugh a lot and tell stupid
jokes (like :"YVho was the
commander of the Italian
submarine fleet during World War
II? Answer: Chicken of the Sea.)
People assume that anyone
good-natured couldn't be
intellectual. Second, spend most
of the day in the Coffee House
and study at night surreptitiously
in a rented room in East Palo
Alto. If anyone catches you with
a book, tell them you are on
Work-Study and are doing a
bibliography for Professor
Kennedy. (This is safe as he is
always needing new bibliographies
which he folds into paper
airplanes and sails from History
Corner to Hoo Tow. It's an effort
to break a distance record set by
Lewis Spitz in 1968 with old
Danforth applications.) If none of

these things work, you will be
forced to try Plan Three although
my blood runs cold to even
suggest it. Plan Three: Become
religious. Attend religious
services—preferably Roman
Catholic —and testify publicly that
you not only believe in God but
also in the institutional church.
This is pretty bitter medicine, but
I guarantee that no one will think
you have a brain in your head
after seeing you at mass.
Meanwhile, I'll light a candle to
St. Jude for you.

Mom
Dear Mom,
I don't quite know what's
wrong with me. I'm a complete
misfit here at Stanford. No matter
how hard I try, I find my required
reading interesting. Speaking
French seems like fun to me.
Lately, I've lost control, and have
been doing ex Ira reading in my
major. Is there are hope for me?
Intellectually yours,
M isfit

Dear Misfit,
The admissions office does slip
up once in a while and lets in a
scholar rather than a good
student. Usually they are weeded
out and refused admission
for being "some kind of a
screwball." If it is any consolation
to you, there is another scholar in
classics and rumor has it that
there is one in the poly sci
department, although the
department denies it vehemently.
There are several alternatives
for you: The really important
point here is that you not reveal
this perverted interest in your
studies (especially to your
professors who wouldn't believe
it, anyhow, and would think you
were apple polishing.) In other
words, it's all right to be a scholar,
just so you hide it.
Try the following suggestions:
First, laugh a lot and tell stupid
jokes (like :"YVho was the
commander of the Italian
submarine fleet during World War
II? Answer: Chicken of the Sea.)
People assume that anyone
good-natured couldn't be
intellectual. Second, spend most
of the day in the Coffee House
and study at night surreptitiously
in a rented room in East Palo
Alto. If anyone catches you with
a book, tell them you are on
Work-Study and are doing a
bibliography for Professor
Kennedy. (This is safe as he is
always needing new bibliographies
which he folds into paper
airplanes and sails from History
Corner to Hoo Tow. It's an effort
to break a distance record set by
Lewis Spitz in 1968 with old
Danforth applications.) If none of

these things work, you will be
forced to try Plan Three although
my blood runs cold to even
suggest it. Plan Three: Become
religious. Attend religious
services—preferably Roman
Catholic —and testify publicly that
you not only believe in God but
also in the institutional church.
This is pretty bitter medicine, but
I guarantee that no one will think
you have a brain in your head
after seeing you at mass.
Meanwhile, I'll light a candle to
St. Jude for you.

Dear Mom,
What are those big colorful
tents for in front of Tresidder
Union?
Curious
Dear Curious,
It's a bar-mitzpah.
Religiously,

Dear Mom,
I am so bewildered by the
campus politics. Could you define
and summarize the different
viewpoints?
Apolitical
Dear Apolitical,
Basically there are three
camps: 1) the Kamikaze liberals
who wish to raze the University,
plow under its buildings, and then
salt the earth on which it stood.
Second, are the conservatives who
want to return to "reason" and
"Civilized" behavior which means
they want the liberals burnt,
drawn and quartered, and their
remains suspended in iron cages in
Main Quad. Third are the
moderates who are equally
attracted to both propositions and
are consequently in a catatonic
state of indecision and inaction.
Love,
Mom
