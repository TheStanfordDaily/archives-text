## Stanford's Double Standard 
### Eric Treisman 
I was one of the five students
on last year's C-15. I put in a lot
of hours helping to write
something called the Legislative
and Judicial Charter of 196 M. To
say that I was dissatisfied with the
emasculated final draft is to
understate; but I voted to ratify
it, even when the other student
members abstained. I did so for
two reasons. First, I guessed it
would encourage, if not coerce,
the administration's observance of
due process in administering
student conduct regulations.
Second, I guessed it would
prevent arbitrary formulations of
such regulations.
I guessed wrong twice.
1. Under the Charter, you're
presumed innocent until proven
guilty. That's elementary due
process, substantive variety. It

doesn't make any difference who
has formally empowered whom to
do what: when sentences are
passed pending trials, elementary
substantive due process is violated
plenty.
2. About seven months ago,
Building 10 unilaterally
announced an interim campus
policy on disruption. The students
on C-15 had all been leery of the
Charter's emergency provision for
Building 10 to do such things; but
we went along with it because the
faculty and administration
members all assured us it would
never be used, that the only
purpose of the thing was to
comfort the trustees. It was only
for emergencies, remember.
Do you remember any
emergency on October 8?
Pursuant to promulgating his

unilateral legislation, the
President, under the Chater, is
required to consult as many SCLC
members as possible; for the
period before the SCLC was set
up, his obligation was to consult
as many appropriate members of
the student body as possible.
No students were consulted on
the disruption policy.
Because we had just had a
ghastly experience with an interim
something or other that had hung
on for three years, we insisted
that the Charter make interim
presidential legislation lapse after
90 days.
The campus disruption policy
is still in effect.
Principle
Yes, of course, I know. The
Charter wasn't formally ratified

by student referendum until the
week the campus disruption
policy was promulgated. We only
formally ratified it in principle
last May, as did the faculty and
administration. Of course,
President Sterling did commit
himself and his administration to
adherence to the principles of the
Charter when the ink was barely
dry on it. The fact remains that
the administration has been
grossly, cynically violating the
spirit of the heart of the
document even as it waves the
thing in our faces.
Not that it hasn't been
violating the letter as well. I
remember a three hour fight in
the C-15 —I remember it
particularly because Provost
Lyman came in on it to suggest
that we all go home—when we
tried to keep the Dean of
Students out of judicial council
hearings, where he had too often
exacerbated tensions. We thought
we won the compromise:
according to 11-G-2, the Dean
' will not conduct
cross-examination," as I
privileged to see him do last week
at the trial of one of the Encina
defendants. Maybe that was
Professor Friedenthal's work:
Professor Friedenthal called me
into his office last November to
show me how he had re-written
(streamlined, I think he called it)
the judicial council's guidelines.
Most of his amendments weren't
bad, and I told him so. I also
mentioned that the Charter didn't
give him amending power. He said
he thought he was all right.
Outraged
Well, shit, I'm not going to
review the whole Charter. If you
doubt, or if you want to get
outraged, just pick up your own
copy at the Dean s office and read
it and compare what it says with
what s being done. Mr. Goodbar
says, do it today.

One other thing. This is totally
irrelevant unless you suspect, as I
do, that Stanford's got a double
standard. 1966: two dozen bulky
Delts catch Dave Harris alone, at
night, and drag him into some
bushes and shave his head. Dean
Winbigler and the judicial council
give them two terms' probation.
Dean Winbigler noting that an act
of basically praiseworthy political
expression had unfortunately
become too boisterous. 1969: two
dozen scrufty SDS'rs catch two
dozen trustees alone with the
administration and some
photographers and, you know,
offend them. Two thousand bucks
and suspended suspensions all
around.
