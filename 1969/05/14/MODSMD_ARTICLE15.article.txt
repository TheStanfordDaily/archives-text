## SDS Goes Capitalist 
### Art Buchwald 
The Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS) have urged their
members to get their hair cut,
shave off their beards and
sideburns and infiltrate the
business community this summer.
The idea is to foment revolution
off the campus.
Some businessmen are fearful
of the results of such an
infiltration. But I think the SDS is
taking a bigger chance than
business. It's one thing to stick to
your ideals on a campus with 50
or 60 other students giving you
support, but it's another to go off
all alone into the business world
and keep from being corrupted.
Bearing in mind that most
members of SDS are usually the
brighter students, let's go to the
Flipper Department Store where
Barney Longstreet, an SDS leader,
has managed to get a job as a
trainee in the men's clothing
department. For a start, Barney
has been sticking pictures of Che
Guevara in the suits hanging on
the racksâ€”a smali thing, but as
Mao Tse-tung says, "A
revolutionary must work in the
pocket of most resistance."
Barney does this early in the
morning. Since he is always the
first one there, the men's clothing
buyer is very impressed with him
and one days announces that he is
elevating Barney from his trainee
position to full salesman.
Unsettled
This surprise appointment
leaves Barney unsettled, as he
wants to pursue the life of the
lowliest employee to get the feel
of what it is like to be exploited

by the capitalist system. Rather
than reveal his true identity,
Barney accepts the promotion.
His chances of fomenting
revolution among the employees
are limited to lunch and smoking
breaks, and when Barney tells the
employees what a lousy deal they
have at Flipper's, he attracts a
large audience.
The vice president of
personnel, who has no idea what
Barney is talking to the other
employees about, feels that if he
can attract such large audiences he
must have executive potential
and, therefore, he makes him a
floor manager at a healthy salary
increase.
Reforms
Stricken with fear that he is
selling out, Barney hands in a list
of reforms which he says the store
must agree to before he takes the
job. These include Flipper's
Department Store getting involved
in the community, donating part
of its profits to the employees and
setting up an Afro-American
clothing boutique.
These demands are sent up to
the president of Flipper's, and
after reading them he says, "Why
didn't we think of this first? I
don't want Longstreet working as
floor manager. He's too valuable
to waste there. Bring him up to
the executive offices."
Barney is now in real trouble
because, thanks to his demands,
profits of Flipper's are up 30%,
and he is made a vice president in
charge of promotion. He is so
busy thinking up new ideas that
he has little time for fomenting

revolution. In keeping with his
position, he has a new apartment,
a new car and he spends his
evenings at Fifth Avenue bars
meeting airline stewardesses. The
only revolutionary activity he has
time for is reading Marcuse on the
Long Island Railroad when he
goes to Westhampton for the
weekend.
G uiit
Once, in a moment of extreme
guilt, Barney sits down on the
floor in the president's office to
show his disdain for the system.
But when the president and other
executives come in, they all join
him on the floor and they hold a
meeting on how to increase the
store's charge accounts. The
president finds everyone so much
more relaxed when they sit on the
floor that he orders all the
furniture taken out of his office.
At the end of the summer
Barney is offered his own store,
which Flipper's is opening in
Westchester County; and since
he's too ashamed to go back to his
SDS chapter and tell them he's
executive vice president of
Flipper's, he accepts. And so the
Students for a Democratic Society
lose another good man.
