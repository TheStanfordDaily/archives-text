# Guest Column
## Distinguished Strangers 
### Vishist K. Vaid-Raizada 
Stanford is perhaps the only
academic center in the United
States which had foreign students
on its enrollment from its
inception. Canadian students were
the first foreign students to set
foot on this prestigious place of
learning.
Within the last twenty years,
the foreign students on this
campus have increased their
number from just above two
hundred to over a thousand in the
current academic year. The
number of countries represented
has increased enormously, from
46 twenty years ago to 84 at
present. There are also half a
dozen stateless foreign students.
During the last two decades, the
proportion of graduate students
has increased from 57 percent to
88 percent, while the proportion
of women students has slightly
decreased, from 14 percent to 9
percent at present.
The number of French and
Japanese students has increased
tremendously. In 1949 there were
only four French students, now
their number is about ninety, the
second largest from a single
country. This is despite General
de Gaulle's very independent
policies which were often disliked
in Washington. The increase from
a single Japanese student after

second World War to about thirty
at present, symbolises the perfect
reconciliation and the continuing
close social, cultural and
economic relations between
United States and Japan.
Besides adding foreign accent,
flavor and color to the cultural
activities on the campus, the
students from abroad also
significantly contribute in several
other ways. Although there is an
understandable hesitancy on the
part of many a foreign student to
actively participate in the campus
issues (in a recent referendum
among the foreign students
whether to participate in the
campus politics, nearly 50 percent
said "No") there are some notable
members of the foreign
community who have articulated
their concern and sympathy at the
A3M meetings and expressed
views through the Stanford Daily.
In fact foreign students, many of
whom were active members in
student politics in their
universities, would willingly seek
to get involved in the campus
issues, but there are some sensible
reasons not to, such as last
month's deportation of a Nigerian
student activist at San Francisco
State College.
Students from abroad have also
enhanced, in a number of ways,

the quality of intellectual life on
the campus and in the community
in general. Last quarter a Swedish
graduate student gave a seminar
on "Contemporary Swedish
Literature and Drama,"
emphasising on August
Stringberg's works. It was well
attended.
This quarter a student from
Middle East is giving a course,
"Education and Social Change in
Arab Countries of the Near East,"
in General Studies as a part of
senior colloquia program. A
Pakistani graduate student is
delivering a course this quarter,
carrying two units, about "Islam
and the West." It surveys the
various features of the Islamic
culture, the development of
science and learning in Islamic
societies and their impact on the
Western World.
Through the Speakers Bureau
of the Community Service
Committee, nearly one hundred
talks, speeches and lectures were
delivered by the foreign students
in the current academic year to
such varied groups as high school
and junior college students,
Rotary and Lions clubs, and
American Association of
University Women (AAUW).
African and Asian students were

much in demand to discuss
subjects such as Hinduism, Islam,
Buddhism, Caste System, Poverty
gap between the poor and the rich
nations, Political stability in
Africa, etc.
Many students from South
East Asia have been helping the
American students sponsored by
Volunteers in Asia (VIA), with
language and general orientation.
By their presence, the
distinguished strangers are helping
to create an environment which
may someday in the future
actualize what the visionaries have
often called the World University.
