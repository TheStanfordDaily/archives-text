## Groups Change Feathers 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
This spring has become the
season for politically oriented
groups on campus to change their
feathers by a bit of euphonic
nomenclature.
The local radical community
tried it first and, for a time, had a
degree of success. In fact, they
have most likely been able to
radicalize a few formerly sane
members of the Stanford
community.
Now we have the reactionary
community attempting the same
tactic. Unfortunately (for them)
they seem to have overlooked the
one basic rule of playing this
game. That is that you must
maintain a moderate front until
after you have a committed
membership.
The advertisement for CAC in
the May 12th Daily was certainly
a violation of that principle.
Robert Welch would doubtless be
able to see the subtle connections
between the Free Huey rally, the
absence of tanks at the Soviet
May Day celebrations and the
troubles at Stanford; the average
Stanford student (including yours
truly) cannot.
Picture what would have
become of the A3M if they had
announced at their first meeting
that their ultimate goals were the
overthrow of the United States
government and the forcible
implementation of international
socialism. Their support might
have been sufficient to stage a
sit-in in the Tresidder lobby.
Instead they concentrated on only
a few innocuous demands to gain
student commitments. Only after
a large group had rallied to their
Cause did the tactics and goals
being to take on -a radical flavor.

It appears as if the CAC may
already have blown it. If so,
another quick name change may
yet save the day for them.
As for myself, I am allergic to
bullshit whether it is painted
radical red, loyalist blue, covered
with polka dots or a Skotch plaid.
Comes the revolution, I plan to be
out of town.

Editor, THE DAILY:
No one will deny the right of
Stanford students to boycott their
classes. By doing so, they are not
only showing their support for the
Aprih 3rd Movement, but also for
the right of those who are not of
their opinion to continue to
attend classes. They must be
complimented on their
moderation and their
willingness to work within the
guidelines of the University.
Regardless of whether or not they
are successful in affecting
University policy, they will gain
the admiration of everyone for
not having accepted the type of

reasoning which prompted a
general to say that he had to
destroy a Vietnamese village in
order to save it.
It is doubtful, however, that
many will respect the
irresponsible behavior of those
instructors who let their
dedication to the principles of
academic freedom be overrided by
their wish to take a partisan stand
in the present debate over the
SRI. By cancelling their classes,
they made it impossible for
students to show their support or
rejection of the A3M: a boycott
of classes is affective only when
there are classes to boycott.
Furthermore, they misused their
position as a responsible member
of this academic community and,
in the process, penalized those
students who did not share their
views.
The students have every right
to boycott classes: without
interfering with the rights of
others, they are thus able to show
their support for the A3M. The
faculty members also have every
right to their opinions. But no
professor has any right to penalize
students so as to emphasize his
support for a cause! Johnj ohn Wilson

members of the Stanford
community.
Now we have the reactionary
community attempting the same
tactic. Unfortunately (for them)
they seem to have overlooked the
one basic rule of playing this
game. That is that you must
maintain a moderate front until
after you have a committed
membership.
The advertisement for CAC in
the May 12th Daily was certainly
a violation of that principle.
Robert Welch would doubtless be
able to see the subtle connections
between the Free Huey rally, the
absence of tanks at the Soviet
May Day celebrations and the
troubles at Stanford; the average
Stanford student (including yours
truly) cannot.
Picture what would have
become of the A3M if they had
announced at their first meeting
that their ultimate goals were the
overthrow of the United States
government and the forcible
implementation of international
socialism. Their support might
have been sufficient to stage a
sit-in in the Tresidder lobby.
Instead they concentrated on only
a few innocuous demands to gain
student commitments. Only after
a large group had rallied to their
Cause did the tactics and goals
being to take on -a radical flavor.

It appears as if the CAC may
already have blown it. If so,
another quick name change may
yet save the day for them.
As for myself, I am allergic to
bullshit whether it is painted
radical red, loyalist blue, covered
with polka dots or a Skotch plaid.
Comes the revolution, I plan to be
out of town.

No one will deny the right of
Stanford students to boycott their
classes. By doing so, they are not
only showing their support for the
Aprih 3rd Movement, but also for
the right of those who are not of
their opinion to continue to
attend classes. They must be
complimented on their
moderation and their
willingness to work within the
guidelines of the University.
Regardless of whether or not they
are successful in affecting
University policy, they will gain
the admiration of everyone for
not having accepted the type of

reasoning which prompted a
general to say that he had to
destroy a Vietnamese village in
order to save it.
It is doubtful, however, that
many will respect the
irresponsible behavior of those
instructors who let their
dedication to the principles of
academic freedom be overrided by
their wish to take a partisan stand
in the present debate over the
SRI. By cancelling their classes,
they made it impossible for
students to show their support or
rejection of the A3M: a boycott
of classes is affective only when
there are classes to boycott.
Furthermore, they misused their
position as a responsible member
of this academic community and,
in the process, penalized those
students who did not share their
views.
The students have every right
to boycott classes: without
interfering with the rights of
others, they are thus able to show
their support for the A3M. The
faculty members also have every
right to their opinions. But no
professor has any right to penalize
students so as to emphasize his
support for a cause! Johnj ohn Wilson

This spring has become the
season for politically oriented
groups on campus to change their
feathers by a bit of euphonic
nomenclature.
The local radical community
tried it first and, for a time, had a
degree of success. In fact, they
have most likely been able to
radicalize a few formerly sane
members of the Stanford
community.
