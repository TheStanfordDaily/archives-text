# A3M Motion Denied
## Court Restraining Order Upheld 
### LANG ATWOOD 
After hearing almost two hours of
testimony yesterday morning, Judge
Stanley R. Evans denied a motion
presented in behalf of 23 defendants to
dissolve the temporary restraining order
enjoining them from engaging in any
disruptive action and from entering
academic or administrative buildings.
The Superior Court judge then
granted the attorneys representing the
April 3rd Movement defendants a two

day continuance on the hearing to show
cause why the temporary order should
not be made permanent. The hearing is
now scheduled for 10 a.m. Thursday
morning, no other delays are
anticipated.
The court made it clear, however,
that while granting continuance, the
provisions of the temporary restraining
order will remain in effect until the new
hearing date.
The April 3rd Movement based its
challenge of the restraining order on
constitutional and procedural grounds
and did not deny any of the reports of
property damage or attempt to defend
the Encina sit-in.
Order Attacked
The entire order was attacked
because it was "the fault of an
unconstitutional proceeding." Rules of
Superior Court and the civil court code
were cited to back up the procedural
points.
James VVolpman, one of four
Movement attorneys present, also tried
to show the court that section five of
the restraining order violated free
speech and assembly rights of the
defendants. He cited a recent supreme
court ruling that held an injunction
issued ex parte and involved free speech
rights.
Four attorneys representing Stanford
from the law firm of McCutchen, Doyle,

Brown and Enersen argued that words
were not being censored by preventing
destructive acts from occurring on
campus.
Trespass Not Free Speech
The trustee's attorney said that it
does not follow that to prohibit a
person from entering a building you
must make sure he doesn't speak.
"It is a restraint upon trespass and
not a restraint upon free speech," he
concluded.
Judge Evans evidently agreed, as he
ruled that Stanford's case is easily
differentiated from the Supreme Court's
decision and concluded that the
occupation of Encina, acts of violence
and the threat of continued violence
were sufficient grounds for the issuance
of a temporary restraining order.
Named Without Evidence
Defense council also charged that
three names were included on the
original list of defendants without a
supporting affidavit atesting to the fact
that they were observed inside Encina
Hall. Judge Evans questioned the
trustee's attorneys and found this to be
correct. He admonished them and then
ordered that the three, John Perrin,
Dave Pugh and Phil Trounstine be
removed from the list of defendants
that are enjoined by section five from
entering certain areas of the campus.

Stanford's attorneys objected to the
removal of Pugh's name stating that
they had filed an affidavid several davs
after the injunction was issued. The
Judge overruled their objection saying
that his name should not have been
included on the original list without a
supporting statement.
