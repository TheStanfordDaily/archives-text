# From The Ivory Tower
## Antagonists Distort The Truth 
### Gabriel Almond 
The main cause of the
confusion in the debate about
counterinsurgency research on the
Stanford Campus is that the April
3 Movement and those who
support its demands are not
primarily concerned about
research at all. They are
concerned about American
foreign policy in Vietnam,
Southeast Asia, and the rest of the
Third World.
They are also concerned about
American policy toward its own
minority groups. The antagonists
of "counterinsurgency research"
would have us believe that some
substantial part of the research on
Southeast Asia, the Third World,
and minority group problems in
the U.S. now being done in
American universities is biased
research, research intended to
buttress reactionary governments,
or in support of reactionary
American foreign and domestic
policies. I would argue that this is
an enormous distortion of the
truth.
Anyone who takes the trouble
to read the products of American
social science research on Asia,

the Middle East, Africa, and Latin
America, or examine the work
being done on minority group
problems in this country would
realize that the principal policy
thrust behind this work is concern
for the self-development of the
peoples of the Third World, and
for our own disadvantaged castes
and classes.
Up until recently the main
criticism of social science research
in American universities has come
from the conservative right,
claiming that social science
faculties are overwhelmingly
stafl'ed by liberals and
left-wingers, that it is practically
impossible to find a conservative
economist, political scientist,
sociologist, historian,
anthropoligist, etc. on American
college and university campuses,
and that the teaching these
faculties engage in and the
research they do is liberal and
left-wing teaching and research.
Integrity
Perhaps this attack from both
sides of the political spectrum is
the best indication we have that
American scholars working on

problems of foreign areas and
domestic welfare are, by and
large, doing what they should be
doing, living up to their
professional ideals as best they
can, telling it the way it really is
insofar as imperfect man can do
so. Our research should be better
research, and there should be
more of it particularly on our
domestic problems. We can make
no progress in coping with these
problems without first having a
solid body of information and
analysis. If we were to bend it or
bias it to support the aims of this
or that political group, we would
violate our own professional
integrity and turn the university
into a collection of embattled
political factions and sects.
And this is what the
couterinsurgency demand is all
about. Many of its supporters
would have us turn the university
into a political movement. In the
name of separating the university
from the military-industrial
complex, they would have us
create a university-radical
complex, and if the autonomy of
the university, if its commitment
to free inquiry were to be
destroyed in the process, there are
some who are quite prepared to
go these lengths.
I have thought long about the
claims that some part of our
university research on foreign and
domestic problems is
either intended to or has the effect
of contributing to the suppression
of foreign peoples, or of our own
minorities. Those who argue in
these terms have a job on their
hands if they wish to be taken
seriously. The books that have
reported this research are in the
libraries; the articles are in the
journals; and the lecture notes are
on the clipboards. The scholars
are in their studies waiting to be
asked about their current
research. Is there an affinity group
which has had the courage or the
good sense to investigate the
practices they seek to prohibit?
And yet what are their claims
based on if they fail to do so? If
they cannot establish that the evil
which they oppose is a real and
substantial one, how can they
justify the extreme political
methods they employ?

If they were to take the
trouble to examine the research
they criticize, this is what they
would find:
(1) That much of the most
important research that has been
done on the politics, societies,
cultures, and economies of Asia,
Africa, and Latin America has
been done by American scholars,
and that Stanford University has
reasons to be proud of its
contribution to this effort.
( 2) That a very 1 arge
proportion of the Third World's
social scientists has been trained
in American universities, and that
Stanford has reason to be proud
of its contribution to this training.
(3) That the knowledge which
is accumulating through this
research is an important
component of any constructive
effort to improve conditions in

these countries. Indeed, without it
there could be no such
improvement. That this is the case
is demonstrated by the efforts in a
great many of these countries to
develop their own social science
capabilities.
(4) That this truly enormous
development of the social sciences
on a world scale (it includes
Communist countries as well) has
been a product of the last two or
three decades, and that while
there have been mistakes and
distortions of perspective,
American universities have reasons
for pride in their pioneering role
in spreading knowledge about and
insight into the political and social
problems of the Third World.
