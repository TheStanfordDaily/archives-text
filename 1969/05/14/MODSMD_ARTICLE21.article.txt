## Blue-Button Award 
### Terry Fitzgerald 
The good taste, common
courtesy, and proof of will power
award to the Blue Buttons for
their exhibition of American
arrogance and elitism in front of
Pitzer's office Monday night.
As I hope all of you know, a
group of us have been fasting this
last week in front of the
President's office to express our
deep and sincere commitment to
the redirecting of a portion of the
machine that builds wealth for a
few and causes many to starve. We
have done this in a most peaceful
manner that is a most direct type
of moral persuasion and which
should make our sincerity
unquestionable. Last night a
group of people came out in front
of us, set up a dinner table, sat
down, and gaily drank cocktails
and munched their rich American
foods . . . How much do I need to
say?
I've been "on water for over
eight days now, trying to reach a
group of men who today have an
opportunity to take a very real
step toward redirecting this
country, and most of whom are
probably oblivious to what we are
doing. So it's been eight days
now, and last night these typical
Stanford students, decked out in
coats and ties pull up their table
and dine in front of us. Later one
of them pulls up a Jaguar behind
the table and a girl hops on the
fender for the picture. How very
American. How typical of our
sense of values.
Amazing. Such a perfect
analogy to our people, our cities,
and our country. On the television
we display the luxuries and
extravagances of our way of life
to people who have been deprived
of them all their lives and have no
hope of attaining them.

In our cities are magnificent
air-conditioned buildings where
we make use of these luxuries, eat
our fine foods, and design more
luxuries and more ways to fatten
our wallets—all decked out in our
new suits and fine ties. In the very
shadows of these buildings are
those sweltering slums where
there live hungry and dejected
human beings, even tantalized by
the plush and secure life they see
and are denied.
"America has 7% of the
world's population and 67% of
the world's wealth." And we
display this wealth to the people
of the world, build industries in
their countries, and create cities
with plush huge office buildings
where a few are treated to
"American" life. In the shadows
of these buildings live the
oppressed many, who are forever
tantalized by those luxuries—and
are forever denied them.
And all the while the wealthy
few strut proudly and arrogantly,
displaying their "success" as proof
of their will power. Let them try
starving a while.
Thank you fellows. Thanks for
a glimpse of the Stanford life—a
true example of all that is
American.
