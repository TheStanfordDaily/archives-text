# TV Defended

"The original purpose of
television was to make the
common man the uncommon
man," declared Sylvester (Pat)
Weaver, former president of
NBC-TV, in a lecture to graduate
students in communications last
week entitled "Can Television Be
Rescued?"
Alluding to the fierce battle
between theater-owners and
pay-TV promoters which he
initiated in 1963 and which is
raging still, Weaver said that
pay-TV is the answer to the
challenge which television and
movies have failed to meet.
"The movies supply about two
per cent of. our audiovisual
needs," Weaver said. "This is
because the movies have always
been dominated by a few men,
always storytellers, with no
interest in communications at all,
nothing."
First introduced temporarily in
California in 1 963 as
Subsrciption-TV, headed by
Weaver, cable television can
supply your home with up to 80
or more channels for a monthly
charge, making available "shows
which have a purpose beyond
diversion."
Weaver said that television
could even take people back in
history. An idea which is typical
of Weaver's blue-chip approach to
TV as educator is a projected 100
hour history of the Roman
Republic in color, put together
from the unused footage of
''Cleopatra'' and other
spectaculars.
"Why don't we have it?,"he
asked "Because right in the
present state of the art with the
present interplay of activities in
all go ve rnments —socialist,
incentive—you have fights and
management that has no brains
holding things back. They cannot
hold them back forever."
Weaver is convinced that the
network interests, the stations,
the commercials, and the situation
comedies cannot prevail
