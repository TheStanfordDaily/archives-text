# Stanford in Salamanca
## 
### GILBERT DIAZ, JR 
An unheralded addition to
Stanford's overseas study
programs is the new program in
Salamanca, Spain. Thirteen
students in the spearhead
"Salamanca I" lived and studied
there last autumn-winter quarters
and were directed by Spanish and
Portuguese department head
Bernard Gicovate.
Last year Gicovate expanded
his department's activity to the
old, university city of Salamanca
because of its ideal suitability for
the study of the Castilian tongue
and way of life. This program is to
be a permanent, integral part of
the Spanish department offerings.
Although primarily a Spanish
majors program for advanced
undergraduates and grads,
students in other fields who are
competent and interested in
Spanish may definitely qualify for
it. Participants enroll
simultaneously at Stanford and at
the U. of Salamanca School of
Philosophy and Letters; the
15-unit work includes a required
course taught jointly by the
Stanford professor and a Spanish
counterpart.
Situated in the heart of a vast
cattle-raising, agricultural country
in the old Leon-Castilla region,
Salamanca is a city of about
115,000 and is best known for its
venerable University (est. 1218).
Its fame also comes from its many
clerical "factories," churches, and
cathedrals; Salamanca was once
the intellectual center of the
Counter Reformation and a
bastion of the Inquisition.
Life Contrasis
Today life contrasts are sharply
visible as one sees mini-skirted
coeds casually walk through
medieval University halls, or the
heavy modern trucks which daily
rumble across the wide, murky
River Tormes on the old, solid
Roman bridge.
Unique in the world is the
daily Salmantine routine of
sipping " tinto" (red) wine,
cognac, plus assorted beverages in
several of the thousands of small
bars and cafes that abound in
literally every section of town.
Numerous on-campus bars cater
to students before, between, and
after class.
Students participating in this
study program should expect to
reside in a social environment very
different from that of Hometown,
U.S.A.; living facilities are often
not up to U.S. par. Nevertheless,
most Salamanca-I veterans assert
that any "pains of adaptation" are
easily worth the effort.
"Small-Town" Atmosphcrc
Salamanca's "Small-town"
college atmosphere helps a
foreigner get to know people and
make friends. Course offerings
allow for discriminating course
and prof selection. Participants
may also give private English
lessons to the many interested
Spaniards. Madrid's cosmopolitan
life is four inexpensive hours away
by bus or train. Aside from the
extensive Christmas vacation,
there are several scheduled group
excursions to other parts of Spain
and Portugal.
Information about Salamanca
II is available in the department of
Spanish and Portuguese offices.
Dr. Gustavo Alfaro, next year's
resident director in Salamanca,
encourages male students to apply

for the few openings left as there
are now eight girls and only two
males scheduled for next vear.
