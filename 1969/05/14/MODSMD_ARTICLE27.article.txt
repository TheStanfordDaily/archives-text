## Stanford Hosts Finals Daily Sports 
### 
The two best collegiate tennis
teams in the nation—USC and
UCLA—will be on hand to battle
it out for the Pacific-8 Conference
tennis championship here at
Stanford starting tomorrow and
running through Saturday.
Each of the eight schools will
enter six singles players and three
doubles teams in a round robin
tournament. This will be the
fourth year the Pac-8 has staged a
round robin championship rather
than an individual elimination
tournament in its championships.
The USC Trojans, Pac-8 and
NCAA defending champions, are
led by Bob Lutz and Mexican
Davis Cup stars Joaquin
Loyo-Mayo and Marcelo Lara.
The Bruins, who split with USC in
regular season dual matches, will
feature the play of Roy Barth,
Steve Tidball and soph sensation
Jeff Borowiak. It figures to be
strictly a two-way battle between
these cross-town L.A. rivals for
the team title with Stanford and
California expected to battle it
out for third place.
California's best player is Bob
Alloo, who is a strong challenger
coming off a fine showing in the
California State championships.
Lutz teamed with senior star Stan
Smith to lead the Trojans to Pac-8
and NCAA titles a year ago.



DARKHORSE TEAM?—If host
Stanford is to pull off a major upset
and win the Pacific-8 tennis
championships, it will have to be a
team effort. Two solid Tribe
performers, Stan Pasarell (left) and
Paul Marienthal (above) must come
through with exceptional matches. In
their final league meeting of the year
against Cal, the Indians were clobbered
7-2. It will be against the Bears that
Coach Dick Gould's netters will be
fighting for the third spot this week.
