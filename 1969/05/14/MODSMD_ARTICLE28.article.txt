An angry Stanford baseball
team returned to the Farm last
night after a highly successful
five-day road trip ended on a
dismal note. The Tribe made five
errors while dropping a 4-3
decision to the Oregon Ducks and
thereby blew a chance to remain
tied with UCLA for the Pac-8
lead.
The torrid Bruins beat
Washington 5-2 at Seattle and
became the first team to grab full
possession of the conference lead
this season. Their 15-4 record puts
the Tribe, at 14-5, one game back.
USC lost to Washington State
yesterday and is now two back at
13-6 while Cal, at 12-7, is in
fourth place.
Stanford got runs at both ends
and in the middle yesterday but
gave Oregon the ball game. The
Indians jumped to a 1-0 lead on
Mike Swing's first inning homer
then fell behind when the Ducks
tallied twice in the fourth. But a
Stanford run in the fifth evened
the score—briefly.
A two-base error by
center-fielder Ron Shotts and a
pair of miscues by the usually
sure-handed first baseman Mark
Marquess put Oregon ahead by
one in the sixth, but Shotts
powered a homer to left in the
ninth to even it at 3-3. Yet, the
game — and the league
lead—disappeared in the bottom
half of the frame when Oregon's
Dave Wicklund singled, stole
second, went to third on a balk by

Rod Poteete, and came home on a
single by Steve Arnold.
League play ends for Stanford
with two games with Cal this
weekend. Friday's game here will
be broadcast by KZSU at 3:00.
UCLA and USC play each other
twice in L.A.
Yesterday's game marked the
completion of a five-day road trip
which started last Friday in
Pullman, Wash., when Stanford
scored three runs in the ninth to
edge Washington State 5-4. On
Saturday the Indians swept a pair
from Washington in Seattle,
winning 5-1 and 6-2.

The scenery was different but
the script the same when the
Indians played Oregon State in a
Monday doubleheader in
Corwallis. The Tribe swept
another pair, this time by 4-3 and
12-2 margins. Co-captain Bob
Boone had a fair day: scattered
eight hits and won the opener;
had a double and two singles;
homered and doubled in the
nightcap.
Keller won the second game
for the Tribe, fanning 14 and
allowing six hits. Stanford broke
up a no-hitter by the Beaver's Jim
Powell with a (get this) nine-run
seventh.

twice in L.A.
Yesterday's game marked the
completion of a five-day road trip
which started last Friday in
Pullman, Wash., when Stanford
scored three runs in the ninth to
edge Washington State 5-4. On
Saturday the Indians swept a pair
from Washington in Seattle,
winning 5-1 and 6-2.

The scenery was different but
the script the same when the
Indians played Oregon State in a
Monday doubleheader in
Corwallis. The Tribe swept
another pair, this time by 4-3 and
12-2 margins. Co-captain Bob
Boone had a fair day: scattered
eight hits and won the opener;
had a double and two singles;
homered and doubled in the
nightcap.
Keller won the second game
for the Tribe, fanning 14 and
allowing six hits. Stanford broke
up a no-hitter by the Beaver's Jim
Powell with a (get this) nine-run
seventh.
An angry Stanford baseball
team returned to the Farm last
night after a highly successful
five-day road trip ended on a
dismal note. The Tribe made five
errors while dropping a 4-3
decision to the Oregon Ducks and
thereby blew a chance to remain
tied with UCLA for the Pac-8
lead.
The torrid Bruins beat
Washington 5-2 at Seattle and
became the first team to grab full
possession of the conference lead
this season. Their 15-4 record puts
the Tribe, at 14-5, one game back.
USC lost to Washington State
yesterday and is now two back at
13-6 while Cal, at 12-7, is in
fourth place.
Stanford got runs at both ends
and in the middle yesterday but
gave Oregon the ball game. The
Indians jumped to a 1-0 lead on
Mike Swing's first inning homer
then fell behind when the Ducks
tallied twice in the fourth. But a
Stanford run in the fifth evened
the score—briefly.
A two-base error by
center-fielder Ron Shotts and a
pair of miscues by the usually
sure-handed first baseman Mark
Marquess put Oregon ahead by
one in the sixth, but Shotts
powered a homer to left in the
ninth to even it at 3-3. Yet, the
game — and the league
lead—disappeared in the bottom
half of the frame when Oregon's
Dave Wicklund singled, stole
second, went to third on a balk by

Rod Poteete, and came home on a
single by Steve Arnold.
League play ends for Stanford
with two games with Cal this
weekend. Friday's game here will
be broadcast by KZSU at 3:00.
UCLA and USC play each other
twice in L.A.
