## Tribe, Rivals Tie 
### 
Nothing was settled Saturday
between Stanford and Palo Alto
in lacrosse, as the traditional rivals
battled to an 8-8 tie. A
double-overtime session did not
even settle the issue. Tied 7-7
after regulation play, the game
went into the regulation two
overtime periods of five minutes
apiece. But each team scored one
goal in each period to leave the
contest stalemated.
The underdog Palo Altans"
jumped to an early lead on
Stanford, with four goals in the
first period, and went into the
halftime intermission with a 6-2 ■
lead. But it has almost become
customary for Palo Alto to take
the lead in games against
Stanford, only to drop them later.
Palo Alto led 6-2 at halftime last
season, only to lose 7-6 in the
closing minutes. Stanford seemed
bent on writing the same script, as
they came roaring back in the
third period with as fine a quarter
of lacrosse as they have played all
season.
Chip Loveman, George Muser,
Don Stebbins, Stu Childs, and
Chris Rafferty all tallied for the
Tribe, while the defense, led again
by Bill Eakland and by an
outstanding performance by

Frank Shafroth on Palo Alto's
All-American Bruce Lloyd, kept
Palo Alto scoreless.
The fourth period was a
see-saw battle, with Stanford
shooting a lot and not scoring and
Palo Alto clearing the ball out
when it was vital. Then, with 1:50
left in the game, Palo Alto
executed a perfect fast-brak on
Stanford to send the game into
overtime.
