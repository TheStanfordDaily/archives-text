# Trustees' Statement On SRI
## 
### 
Because some of the research
activities in which Stanford Research
Institute has been engaged are in areas
of deep concern to many members of
the Stanford community, the entire
relationship of the Institute to the
University has been brought into
question. The Board of Trustees, being
ultimately responsible for maintaining
Stanford as an educational institution of
high degree and as the sole members of
SRI, face a multitude of complex issues
which require resolution unless the
University is to be adversely affected on
the one hand, and SRI dissipated or
destroyed on the other.
Careful consideration has been given
to the evidence placed before the
Trustees, including the report of the
Scott Committee, the testimony
presented at the campus hearing on
April 30, the results of a
faculty-student-staff alumni poll, the
action of the faculty Senate on May 2,
the report of the May 7 survey of the
SRI staff, and numerous
communications, both written and oral,
from and with individuals interested in
these problems. This evidence indicates
a wide divergence in view.
In the view of the majority of those
who would reform SRI by University
control, some 10 percent of its research
revenues have been derived from
activities which they deem

objectionable and few would proscribe
SRI from engaging in a still larger share
of its research activities. In any case, to
affiliate the Institute more closely with
the University, as many advocate, would
embark Stanford upon a program of
applied contract research in manner and
scale completely foreign to our concept
of an educational institution of high
quality. Not only this, but in the
process, the Institute as a viable
organization would, in our view,
disintegrate and its highly skilled
personnel be dissipated. The
contributions and concerns of the
approximate 3000 staff of SRI,
including some 1500 professionals, who
have loyally devoted their talent to the
Institute over the years, should not be
overlooked. The opposition of most SRI
professional staff to closer ties with the
University has been clearly
demonstrated.
The Trustees, by definition and
commitment, must take the long view;
they must stop short of the point at
which they would betray their trust or
jeopardize the future in order to achieve
momentary tranquility by placating
those who urge a particular course of
action upon them; they must act to the
end of fostering and protecting the
University in respect to its primary
functions and objectives. Stanford is
already far too short of financial

resourses and administrative manpower
in our opinion to embark on what
would in effect be a major new
venture —an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity.
There are matters of urgent social
concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous
research attack and activity by society
in general. Stanford University and SRI
should be in the forefront of the efforts
to find solutions to these problems and
the Trustees pledge themselves to
encourage such efforts and to seek
support for them. To the extent that
