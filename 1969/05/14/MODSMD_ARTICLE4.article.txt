# Trustees' Statement On SRI
## 
### 
Because some of the research
activities in which Stanford Research
Institute has been engaged are in areas
of deep concern to many members of
the Stanford community, the entire
relationship of the Institute to the
University has been brought into
question. The Board of Trustees, being
ultimately responsible for maintaining
Stanford as an educational institution of
high degree and as the sole members of
SRI, face a multitude of complex issues
which require resolution unless the
University is to be adversely affected on
the one hand, and SRI dissipated or
destroyed on the other.
Careful consideration has been given
to the evidence placed before the
Trustees, including the report of the
Scott Committee, the testimony
presented at the campus hearing on
April 30, the results of a
faculty-student-staff alumni poll, the
action of the faculty Senate on May 2,
the report of the May 7 survey of the
SRI staff, and numerous
communications, both written and oral,
from and with individuals interested in
these problems. This evidence indicates
a wide divergence in view.
In the view of the majority of those
who would reform SRI by University
control, some 10 percent of its research
revenues have been derived from
activities which they deem

objectionable and few would proscribe
SRI from engaging in a still larger share
of its research activities. In any case, to
affiliate the Institute more closely with
the University, as many advocate, would
embark Stanford upon a program of
applied contract research in manner and
scale completely foreign to our concept
of an educational institution of high
quality. Not only this, but in the
process, the Institute as a viable
organization would, in our view,
disintegrate and its highly skilled
personnel be dissipated. The
contributions and concerns of the
approximate 3000 staff of SRI,
including some 1500 professionals, who
have loyally devoted their talent to the
Institute over the years, should not be
overlooked. The opposition of most SRI
professional staff to closer ties with the
University has been clearly
demonstrated.
The Trustees, by definition and
commitment, must take the long view;
they must stop short of the point at
which they would betray their trust or
jeopardize the future in order to achieve
momentary tranquility by placating
those who urge a particular course of
action upon them; they must act to the
end of fostering and protecting the
University in respect to its primary
functions and objectives. Stanford is
already far too short of financial

resourses and administrative manpower
in our opinion to embark on what
would in effect be a major new
venture —an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity.
There are matters of urgent social
concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous
research attack and activity by society
in general. Stanford University and SRI
should be in the forefront of the efforts
to find solutions to these problems and
the Trustees pledge themselves to
encourage such efforts and to seek

for a major applied research activity.
There are matters of urgent social
concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous
research attack and activity by society
in general. Stanford University and SRI
should be in the forefront of the efforts
to find solutions to these problems and
the Trustees pledge themselves to
encourage such efforts and to seek
support for them. To the extent that
the social problems of the day art*
appropriate targets for University
research activities, then programs
should be devised within the
University structure itself,
consistent with Stanford's
financial capacity and with its
educational objectives, rather than
by merging a different kind of
institution into the Stanford
setting for the purpose of
furthering social research, with all
of the financial risks to the
University and damage to skilled
SRI personnel attendant thereon.
The Trustees are of the opinion
that they should not impose
restrictions on the areas of
research to be conducted at SRI.
It is to be noted, however, that
the Executive Committee of the
Board of SRI has advised the
Trustees that the Institute will
henceforth refuse to engage in
research projects dealing directly
with the development of weapons
of biological or chemical warfare.
This is a position which is in
accord with the actions of the
Senate of the Academic Council,
and the Board of Trustees itself.
Further, the Trustees commend
and support the action of the SRI
Board in committing itself to a
policy of increasing research

activities for the private sector
and in support of programs
designed to assist in the solution
of pressing social problems. We
wholeheartedly endorse these
commitments.
Two further comments are
necessary. First, there is a
continuing need for review of SRI
research policy; the Trustees note
and approve steps being taken at
the Institute toward creating
mechanisms at SRI for carrying
on such review with due regard
for the opinions of the SRI
professional staff. This is, in the
opinion of the Trustees, a matter
for SRI management and staff to
determine, rather than being a
question for University faculty
and students to decide. Second,
many persons on the Stanford
campus have shown their concern
over the matters of
counter-insurgency research. The
Trustees have considered this with
care, but have concluded that
limitations upon research policy
under this heading are neither
feasible nor desirable. Discussions
of the topic by the Senate of the
Academic Council have indicated
the difficulty inherent in defining
limitations on this kind of
research.
After careful consideration of

the many factors involved, the
Trustees believe that formal ties
between the Institute and the
University should be terminated.
This would not, of course,
preclude joint efforts by the two
institutions in areas of common
interest. Separation involves
complex issues, however, which
must receive careful and
time-consuming consideration. To
name only a few, there are
questions of the character of the
Institute's ownership and its
non-profit status; the greatest
financial return to the University
consistent with the continued well
being of SRI, taking into account
the terms of gifts received from
private individuals and
institutions; and the complex and
difficult problems attendant upon
a change in the form and method
or organization of a non-profit
institution under applicable
California law. The Trustees
intend to explore the alternatives
with the end in view of reaching a
resolution of the matter at the
earliest date consistent with the
difficulty and multiplicity of
problems involved. In this
connection, the Trustees intend to
retain qualified outside counsel
and consultants to advise them in
respect to these matters.

which they would betray their trust or
jeopardize the future in order to achieve
momentary tranquility by placating
those who urge a particular course of
action upon them; they must act to the
end of fostering and protecting the
University in respect to its primary
functions and objectives. Stanford is
already far too short of financial

resourses and administrative manpower
in our opinion to embark on what
would in effect be a major new
venture —an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity.
There are matters of urgent social
concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous
research attack and activity by society
in general. Stanford University and SRI
should be in the forefront of the efforts
to find solutions to these problems and
the Trustees pledge themselves to
encourage such efforts and to seek
support for them. To the extent that
the social problems of the day art*
appropriate targets for University
research activities, then programs
should be devised within the
University structure itself,
consistent with Stanford's
financial capacity and with its
educational objectives, rather than
by merging a different kind of
institution into the Stanford
setting for the purpose of
furthering social research, with all
of the financial risks to the
University and damage to skilled
SRI personnel attendant thereon.
The Trustees are of the opinion
that they should not impose
restrictions on the areas of
research to be conducted at SRI.
It is to be noted, however, that
the Executive Committee of the
Board of SRI has advised the
Trustees that the Institute will
henceforth refuse to engage in
research projects dealing directly
with the development of weapons
of biological or chemical warfare.
This is a position which is in
accord with the actions of the
Senate of the Academic Council,
and the Board of Trustees itself.
Further, the Trustees commend
and support the action of the SRI
Board in committing itself to a
policy of increasing research

activities for the private sector
and in support of programs
designed to assist in the solution
of pressing social problems. We
wholeheartedly endorse these
commitments.
Two further comments are
necessary. First, there is a
continuing need for review of SRI
research policy; the Trustees note
and approve steps being taken at
the Institute toward creating
mechanisms at SRI for carrying
on such review with due regard
for the opinions of the SRI
professional staff. This is, in the
opinion of the Trustees, a matter
for SRI management and staff to
determine, rather than being a
question for University faculty
and students to decide. Second,
many persons on the Stanford
campus have shown their concern
over the matters of
counter-insurgency research. The
Trustees have considered this with
care, but have concluded that
limitations upon research policy
under this heading are neither
feasible nor desirable. Discussions
of the topic by the Senate of the
Academic Council have indicated
the difficulty inherent in defining
limitations on this kind of
research.
After careful consideration of

the many factors involved, the
Trustees believe that formal ties
between the Institute and the
University should be terminated.
This would not, of course,
preclude joint efforts by the two
institutions in areas of common
interest. Separation involves
complex issues, however, which
must receive careful and
time-consuming consideration. To
name only a few, there are
questions of the character of the
Institute's ownership and its
non-profit status; the greatest
financial return to the University
consistent with the continued well
being of SRI, taking into account
the terms of gifts received from
private individuals and
institutions; and the complex and
difficult problems attendant upon
a change in the form and method
or organization of a non-profit
institution under applicable
California law. The Trustees
intend to explore the alternatives
with the end in view of reaching a
resolution of the matter at the
earliest date consistent with the
difficulty and multiplicity of
problems involved. In this
connection, the Trustees intend to
retain qualified outside counsel
and consultants to advise them in
respect to these matters.
Because some of the research
activities in which Stanford Research
Institute has been engaged are in areas
of deep concern to many members of
the Stanford community, the entire
relationship of the Institute to the
University has been brought into
question. The Board of Trustees, being
ultimately responsible for maintaining
Stanford as an educational institution of
high degree and as the sole members of
SRI, face a multitude of complex issues
which require resolution unless the
University is to be adversely affected on
the one hand, and SRI dissipated or
destroyed on the other.
Careful consideration has been given
to the evidence placed before the
Trustees, including the report of the
Scott Committee, the testimony
presented at the campus hearing on
April 30, the results of a
faculty-student-staff alumni poll, the
action of the faculty Senate on May 2,
the report of the May 7 survey of the
SRI staff, and numerous
communications, both written and oral,
from and with individuals interested in
these problems. This evidence indicates
a wide divergence in view.
In the view of the majority of those
who would reform SRI by University
control, some 10 percent of its research
revenues have been derived from
activities which they deem

objectionable and few would proscribe
SRI from engaging in a still larger share
of its research activities. In any case, to
affiliate the Institute more closely with
the University, as many advocate, would
embark Stanford upon a program of
applied contract research in manner and
scale completely foreign to our concept
of an educational institution of high
quality. Not only this, but in the
process, the Institute as a viable
organization would, in our view,
disintegrate and its highly skilled
personnel be dissipated. The
contributions and concerns of the
approximate 3000 staff of SRI,
including some 1500 professionals, who
have loyally devoted their talent to the
Institute over the years, should not be
overlooked. The opposition of most SRI
professional staff to closer ties with the
University has been clearly
demonstrated.
The Trustees, by definition and
commitment, must take the long view;
they must stop short of the point at
which they would betray their trust or
jeopardize the future in order to achieve

research policy; the Trustees note
and approve steps being taken at
the Institute toward creating
mechanisms at SRI for carrying
on such review with due regard
for the opinions of the SRI
professional staff. This is, in the
opinion of the Trustees, a matter
for SRI management and staff to
determine, rather than being a
question for University faculty
and students to decide. Second,
many persons on the Stanford
campus have shown their concern
over the matters of
counter-insurgency research. The
Trustees have considered this with
care, but have concluded that
limitations upon research policy
under this heading are neither
feasible nor desirable. Discussions
of the topic by the Senate of the
Academic Council have indicated
the difficulty inherent in defining
limitations on this kind of
research.
After careful consideration of

the many factors involved, the
Trustees believe that formal ties
between the Institute and the
University should be terminated.
This would not, of course,
preclude joint efforts by the two
institutions in areas of common
interest. Separation involves
complex issues, however, which
must receive careful and
time-consuming consideration. To
name only a few, there are
questions of the character of the
Institute's ownership and its
non-profit status; the greatest
financial return to the University
consistent with the continued well
being of SRI, taking into account
the terms of gifts received from
private individuals and
institutions; and the complex and
difficult problems attendant upon
a change in the form and method
or organization of a non-profit
institution under applicable
California law. The Trustees
intend to explore the alternatives
with the end in view of reaching a
resolution of the matter at the
earliest date consistent with the
difficulty and multiplicity of
problems involved. In this
connection, the Trustees intend to
retain qualified outside counsel
and consultants to advise them in
respect to these matters.
Because some of the research
activities in which Stanford Research
Institute has been engaged are in areas
of deep concern to many members of
the Stanford community, the entire
relationship of the Institute to the
University has been brought into
question. The Board of Trustees, being
ultimately responsible for maintaining
Stanford as an educational institution of
high degree and as the sole members of
SRI, face a multitude of complex issues
which require resolution unless the
University is to be adversely affected on
the one hand, and SRI dissipated or
destroyed on the other.
Careful consideration has been given
to the evidence placed before the
Trustees, including the report of the
Scott Committee, the testimony
presented at the campus hearing on
April 30, the results of a
faculty-student-staff alumni poll, the
action of the faculty Senate on May 2,
the report of the May 7 survey of the
SRI staff, and numerous
communications, both written and oral,
from and with individuals interested in
these problems. This evidence indicates
a wide divergence in view.
In the view of the majority of those
who would reform SRI by University
control, some 10 percent of its research
revenues have been derived from
activities which they deem

objectionable and few would proscribe
SRI from engaging in a still larger share
of its research activities. In any case, to
affiliate the Institute more closely with
the University, as many advocate, would
embark Stanford upon a program of
applied contract research in manner and
scale completely foreign to our concept
of an educational institution of high
quality. Not only this, but in the
process, the Institute as a viable
organization would, in our view,
disintegrate and its highly skilled
personnel be dissipated. The
contributions and concerns of the
approximate 3000 staff of SRI,
including some 1500 professionals, who
have loyally devoted their talent to the
Institute over the years, should not be
overlooked. The opposition of most SRI
professional staff to closer ties with the
University has been clearly
demonstrated.
The Trustees, by definition and
commitment, must take the long view;
they must stop short of the point at
which they would betray their trust or
jeopardize the future in order to achieve
momentary tranquility by placating
those who urge a particular course of
action upon them; they must act to the
end of fostering and protecting the
University in respect to its primary
functions and objectives. Stanford is
already far too short of financial

resourses and administrative manpower
in our opinion to embark on what
would in effect be a major new
venture —an assumption of responsibility
for a major applied research activity.
There are matters of urgent social
concern within this country which
should be the objects of vigorous
research attack and activity by society
in general. Stanford University and SRI
should be in the forefront of the efforts
to find solutions to these problems and
the Trustees pledge themselves to
encourage such efforts and to seek
support for them. To the extent that
the social problems of the day art*
appropriate targets for University
research activities, then programs
should be devised within the
University structure itself,
consistent with Stanford's
financial capacity and with its
educational objectives, rather than
by merging a different kind of
institution into the Stanford
setting for the purpose of
furthering social research, with all
of the financial risks to the
University and damage to skilled
SRI personnel attendant thereon.
The Trustees are of the opinion
that they should not impose
restrictions on the areas of
research to be conducted at SRI.
It is to be noted, however, that
the Executive Committee of the
Board of SRI has advised the
Trustees that the Institute will
henceforth refuse to engage in
research projects dealing directly
with the development of weapons
of biological or chemical warfare.
This is a position which is in
accord with the actions of the
Senate of the Academic Council,
and the Board of Trustees itself.
Further, the Trustees commend
and support the action of the SRI
Board in committing itself to a
policy of increasing research

activities for the private sector
and in support of programs
designed to assist in the solution
of pressing social problems. We
wholeheartedly endorse these
commitments.
