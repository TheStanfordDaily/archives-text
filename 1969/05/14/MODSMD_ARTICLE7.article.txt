# SRI Staff Opposes Research Restrictions
## 
### 
An overwhelming majority (84
percent) of Stanford Research
Institute's staff oppose any restrictions
on "national security research"
performed at SRI. Eighty-one percent
oppose the idea of non-SRI people
helping to determine research policy.
These results come from a poll of
SRI staff released yesterday before the
Board of Trustees meeting. More than
two-thirds of SRl's 3000 employees
responded to the poll sent to them May
7. The number of employees on leave of
absence or travel status reduced the
number of those available for response
so that those responding represented
more than eighty percent of the
available staff.
Employees were given one day to
respond to the questionnaire. They were
not asked to put their names on the
poll.
Few Favor Restrixitions
Only 14 percent of the SRI staff
favored restricting national security
research in some way. Most were
sp cif ; about the types of research they
wante< restricted; 6 percent favored
restrictions on chemical and biological
warfare research, 4 percent wanted
restrictions on all "war related"
research; 1 percent wanted restrictions
on counterinsurgency research; and less
than 1 percent indicated preferences for
restrictions on classified research (17
persons), research related to ABM (12
persons), or research related to nuclear
or radiological warfare research (11
persons).
The poll did not name these types of
research but left two lines for
employees to list any research
objectionable to them.
A huge majority of 91 percent
indicated a prefeience that "research
policies at SRI should be determined by
procedures established by the SRI
management and staff." This was
deemed "essential" by 60 percent and
"desirable" by another 31 percent. The
idea of research policies being
determined by a committee composed
of SRI professionals along with students
and faculty from Stanford was rejected
by 81 percent of the staff as being
either "unacceptable" or "undesirable."
On the question of the SRI-Stanford

University relationship, a large majority
of the SRI staff (72 percent) indicated
that, based on the information they
now have, they would prefer
independence from the University. Only
10 percent favored a closer relationship,
while 17 percent were undecided.
The poll indicated a strong
agreement in the answers from SRI
management and those from
non-managerial professionals. On the
question of continuing present policy
on national security research, managers
were 88 percent in favor and
professionals were 76 percent in favor.
On the determination of SRI
research policies, 93 percent of
managers and 89 percent of
professionals wanted only the SRI
management and staff to participate.
Independence from Stanford is
preferred by 81 percent of managers
and 64 percent of professionals. This
trend was also seen in the responses
given by other occupational groups.
"It is quite significant that the
findings of this questionnaire survey are
quite consistent with the content
analysis performed earlier on several
hundred memoranda sent by SRI staff
members to President Anderson,"
explained Dr. Howard Vollmer, leader
of the survey team.
