# Trustees OK Trailers For 500 Students
## 
### 
Plans for a temporary mobile home
village to house nearly 500 single
students on campus were approved by
the Board of Trustees yesterday.
The $1.2 million project will be
self-liquidating. Consisting of
approximately 120 mobile homes,
housing four students each, it will be
located east of Branner Hall, close to
the central campus.
Construction of streets, utilities, and
grading will start in mid-June, with
completion in time for occupancy by
the start of fall quarter. It will be
operated as part of the University's total
student housing and food service
program.

A recent housing report estimated
that 5,000 of the University's 11,400
students now are housed off campus. A
tight market for low rental units in the
surrounding area has produced housing
shortages of growing severity for the
past three years.
Rental rates in the mobile home
project would be $68.33 per person for
1969-70, the same as charged for single
students in nearby Escondido Village.
The mobile home village is expected
to remain in operation at least three
years, but not likely more than five
years, during which time alternate
long-range housing is expected to be
developed.
