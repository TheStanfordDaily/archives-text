# Defendants Ask SJC For Continuance
## 
### WILLIAM CHATFIELD 
A majority of the students suspended
after the Encina sit-in requested a
continuance of the "preliminary
conference with the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) scheduled for today.
In a petition presented to SJC
Chairman Jack Friedenthal yesterday
afternoon, the 51 people who signed
stated they had not had "a reasonable
time to prepare a defense" as provided
for in the Legislative and Judicial
Charter.
The SJC announced Monday the
conferences would be held to^cy
The petition also objected to the fact
that the SJC itself had scheduled the
hearings when, "according to the letter
sent by President Pitzer . . .the hearings
would be held at the request of the
petitioners."
The group further claimed that in the
April 17 recommendation to the
President, the SJC itself had stated that
"hearings will be granted upon request"
of the suspended students.
When contacted last night
Friedenthal said, that it was too late to
call the Council together to consider the
petition.
"We contacted fill the members we
could —not all of them —but we were
basically successful.
"The petition will undoubtedly be
discussed tomorrow; we all want to see
the document. If we see reason for it,
we might grant the continuance
tomorrow, but I seriously doubt that we
will grant it. There was no sentiment for
it tonight.
In its conclusion the students'
petition contended that such a
continuance was a reasonable request.
"For all intents and purposes, these
preliminary conferences are
arraignments. It should be noted that
the California Code of Civil Procedure
allows persons charged with at least one
continuance for a reasonable period of
time as a matter of right."
