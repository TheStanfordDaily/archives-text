Ampex's Sound Idea specialist will be at our
new Mt. View store today (Thursday) from noon
to 9 p.m.
Any questions about tape,
tape recorder operation, edit
ing or acoustics? Come in and
ask. He'll tell you, too, about
new tricks in sound-on-sound
recording, echo effects, and
other things to make your re
cordings sparkle!
No obligation, nothing to
buy. All we ask is that you
enjoy yourself.
(We won't mind if you want to sneak a peek at
Ampex recorders and decks and find out about
the special bonus tape offer.)
