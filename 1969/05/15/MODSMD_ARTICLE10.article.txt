• Jaguar or Die
Editor, THE DAILY:
Terry Fitzgerald in his
searching article "Blue Button
Award" (May 14) illustrates
perfectly the major problem with
this University. It is, as I and he
see it, the "wealthy few" who
"strut proudly and arrogantly"
without any concern or
compassion for A3M or its
objectives; who ignore the
problems of the "hungry and
dejected human beings" of the
world; who are so involved in
their own lives of "new suits and
fine ties," "fine foods" and other
"luxuries" that they are oblivious
to the really major problems of
the world.
There is one mistake that Terry
made (minor perhaps to most
readers). He refers to the car
parked behind the nefarious
dinner table as a Jaguar. However
it was a Ferrari, much more
tantalizing, "plush and secure,"
than a mere Jaguar.

•Subverting
Hditor, THE DAILY:
In response to the letter of
John Wilson, which appeared in
the Daily on Wednesday, and to
the letter distributed by Jim
Schnieder, President, CAC, to
members of the faculty on 13
May, I would like to defend the
action of those faculty members
who, like myself, cancelled classes
Monday and Tuesday in support
of the April 3rd Movement
boycott.
First, members of the student
body who wanted to show their

disapproval of the boycott had
every right to appear in their
classrooms and spend the class
period discussing with other
students either their class work, or
the April 3rd Movement demands,
or the tactic of the boycott itself.
I do not recall that classrooms
were locked Monday and
Tuesday. It requires some effort
to appear in class and to stay
there for the fifty-minute period
when no formal instruction is
taking place. Perhaps this effort
was lacking on the part of Mr.
Schnieder and Mr. Wilson.
Second, members of the
teaching constituency have the
right to express their political
sentiment at Stanford University.
No contract, or even an oral
agreement, forbids faculty
members to cancel classes at times
deemed by them appropriate. It is
understood that each member of
the faculty bears the
responsibility for teaching his
courses, and I would assume that
this responsibility will be fulfilled.
Finally, I would reject the
charge, in Mr. Schnieder's letter,
that cancellation of classes
"subverts several principles of
freedom of expression" and
denies students "the freedom of
choice," while thanking him for
the sollicitude he has shown for
the freedom of choice of those
students who participated in the
boycott, as 1 would deny the
assumption, in Mr. Wilson's letter,
that faculty members who
cancelled classes "misused their
position as a responsible member
(sic) of this academic community
and, in the process, penalized
those students who did not share
their views." I have shown above
that no freedom was restricted.
Mr. Wilson cannot prove that
responsibility has been shirked,
and he should rest assured that

students are not being penalized.

• Converting
Editor, THE DAILY:
A number of teaching
assistants and faculty members
called off their classes Monday
and Tuesday to show support for
the "student" boycott. Their
action subverts several principles
of freedom of expression and
changes the stated intent of the
boycott.
A direct boycott of classes—in
which a student simply does not
attend his classes, and perhaps
even carries a picket sign on the
Quad—is a legitimate form of
protest. The extent to which
classes are thus deserted is an
expression of student support for
whatever cause is propounded.
The situation is not the same,
however, when instructors
summarily cancel (or re-schedule)
their classes. Two immediate
effects of this are:
1. It prevents individual
members of their classes to
express their support or
non-support by attending or not
attending class.
2. It changes the significance
of tallies of class attendance from
being an expression of student
support to being a measure of
power by those who are in
sympathy with the protest.
Is the decision and sympathy
of one teaching assistant or
professor equal to a boycott by
ten, thirty or a hundred students?
The Coalition for an Academic
Community would like to thank
those members of the faculty
that gave their students the
freedom of choice.
