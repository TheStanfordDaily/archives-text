# LETTERS TO THE EDITOR
## Hip, Hip, Hurrah, Trustees! 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
You never really know; come
in.
During the past three weeks we
have heard countless proposals
regarding different actions
students might take to influence
the Stanford Trustees.
After Tuesday's decision by
the above-mentioned Trustees
only one viable alternative appears
to remain open. The students
must admit defeat and
congratulate the Trustees on a
good ball game.
Remembering that old
American adage, it's not whether
you win or lose, but how you play
the game, just think of the
tremendous boost to the image of
college students throughout the
state, if not the whole country, by
such a magnanimous gesture. In
the spirit of our intramural sports
etiquette (and, after all, the whole
affair is intramural), how about a
rousing "Hip, Hip, Hurrah" for
the Trustees from the entire April
3 Movement.
In fact, just to show there are
no hard feelings the whole
Stanford Community could join
in a "Day of Adulation" for the
Board of Trustees. The highlight
of the ceremony could be the
presentation of a plaque to any
Trustee able to attend.
Accompanied by a firm
handshake from each of the
members of the A3M
coordinating committee, the
plaque could be given as an
affirmation of our faith in the
American creed. It would read,
Time is money and money is
time; that is all ye know on earth,
and all ye need to know.
In political circles this strategy
is known as politics of the real. It
is in strict adherence to the rule,
"if you can't batter 'em, flatter
'em." We are confident that the
Trustees will be so happily
surprised by our sportmanlike
reasonableness that they will
voluntarily either give SRI to th<
ASSU, or use all fche money from
its sale to finance a new
department of P.E. (Psychedelic
Exploration).
Kill for peace, pray for rain,
and love yo' master.

•REC.RETS
Editor, I'llK II AII.Y :
1 am writing because I have the
impression that alumni support
for new left politics is not often
enough expressed. I, and others I

know, support the point of view
and goals of the SDS. Their
methods of action seem,
unfortunately, to be the only
effective way to achieve needed
change now, the way best
understood in our present society.
I regret that I and other
students of my day were
dis-inclined to look at social
conditions. I regret that the
University discouraged us from
doing so. I now see that my
successful pursuit of Phi Beta
Kappa was not only a waste of
time, but a positive harm.
University encouragement of such
misdirection delayed my
education. Then as now the
primary University commitment,
conscious or not, was the
maintenance of a certain social
system and hierarchy of privilege.
One step toward a free society
would be the changes advocated
by SDS in the relationship
between students and faculty,
administration and Trustees.
Stopping war-related activities
would be another step away from
destruction and toward freedom.
We must hope that Stanford will
be able to make use of the
imagination and ability offered by
its students.

• REVELATION
Editor, THE DAILY:
In response to persons who
criticize the A3M for its
commitment to "overnight"
change in our nation on the basis
of a "new" morality (i.e. the
"issues" which most of us have
said we agree with), the following
statement written way back in
1933 will clearly reveal the
inappropriateness and absurdity
of words such as "overnight" and
"new".
"We must not conceal from
ourselves that an improvement in
the present depressing situation is
impossible without a severe
struggle; for the handful of those
who are really determined to do
something is minute in
comparison with the mass of
lukewarm and misguided. And
those who have an economic
interest in keeping the machinery
of war going are a powerful body;
they will stop at nothing to make
public opinion subservient to their
murderous ends . .In my opinion,
deliverance can only come from
the people themselves . . .Only if
we succeed in abolishing
compulsory service altogether will

it be possible to educate the
youth in the spirit of
reconciliation, joy in life, and love
towards all living creatures. I
believe that a refusal on
conscientious grounds to serve in
the army when called up, if
carried out by 50,000 men at the
same moment, would be
irresistable. The individual can
accomplish little here, nor can one
wish to see the best among us
devoted to their destruction
through the machinery behind
which stand the three great
powers of stupidity, fear, and
greed." From The World As I See

•PRIVILEGES
Editor, THE DAILY:
Letter to Harvey Hall, registrar,
dated May 13:
''We have received
notificatiofrom you concerning

the withdrawal of University
privileges from a particular
student, requesting us not to
retain that student in our classes.
University privileges, as we
understand them, do not include
the privilege of entering into
dialogue with other people. That
right is universal. Accordingly, we
intend to retain the student
mentioned in our classes, so long
as that student wishes to attend.
The University may or may not
retain him in its class roles. That is
the University's affair. But the
freedom to study and learn does
not depend upon maintaing the
good will of any organization.
