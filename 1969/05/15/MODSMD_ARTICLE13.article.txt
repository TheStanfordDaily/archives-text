## America's Biggest Mistake 
### 
In defiance of the new
Nonproliferation Treaty, in
dcfiance of logic, and in defiance
of common sense, President
Nixon stood before a press
conference in March and
announced that the United States
would proceed to deploy the
Safequard antiballistic missile
system (ABM). The U.S. has a
reputation for doing and saying
some very stupid things in the
international field, but with this
decision we have far exceeded
even our own capacity for
blunder. The President's judgment
to deploy the ABM may well be
the most important decision of
the nuclear age, and if left
unblocked by the Congress may
prove to be the single greatest
monument to shortsightedness
and idiocy the U.S. has ever
created.
There are a great many reasons
for opposing the ABM. Opponents
can and have written hundreds of
pages explaining their resistance
to Stanford, but most simply put,
ABM will be ineffective, wasteful,
and highly dangerous.
Ineffective due to
impracticality, Safeguard
probably won't work any better
than a trip to the moon on
gossamer wings. Former Secretary
of Defense Robert S. McNamara
summed up the practicality
argument by saying, "Every ABM
system that is now feasible
involves firing defensive missiles at
incoming offensive warheads in an
effort to destroy them. Any such
system can rather obviously be
defeated by an enemy simply
sending more offensive warheads
or dummy warheads, than there
are defensive missiles capable of
disposing of them . . .Were we to
deploy an . . .ABM system
throughout the U.S.A. the Soviets
would clearly be strongly
motivated to so increase their
offensive capability as to cancel
out our defensive advantage."
Overwhelming
In addition to overwhelming the
system the Soviets could confuse
it with decoy warheads and
electronic scrambling of American
radar signals. They could also use
chemical or biological warheads
which can't be defused by an
ABM. These obvious objections
from a practicality standpoint are
aggravated by technical
incapacities in the system. There
are numerous scientific grounds
for believing that Safeguard will

be like the ship which slid down
the ways and sank at its
launching.
Foremost among these
problems is the effect of nuclear
"blackout." Once one warhead
goes off in a given area U.S. radars
will no longer be able to track
Soviet warheads in that sector due
to the cloud of ionized gas which
the explosion creates. This will
blind the whole system, and
prevent it from working. The ease
with which our ABM could be
circumvented because of its
impracticality was expressed by
Simon Ramo, Vice-president of
TRW Systems, Inc. (maker of at
least part of almost every
American satellite and rocket),
when he said that with "one-tenth
of the budget of ABM, thick or
thin, I could wreck the system."
Thus the ABM would probably
join that proud and illustrious
group of American weapons
systems that didn't work right
when they had to. Recent
members of this club have
included the F-1118, M-16 rifle,
and Sheridan reconnaissance tank.
Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery
rather than design.
Incapable
The system is not only
incapable of handling a heavy
Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were
to have time to fire an ABM in
some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our
Minutemen, rather than leaving
them in their silos to be blown up.
It takes thirty to forty-five
minutes for a Soviet ICBM to
reach the United States, but it
only requires thirty-two seconds
to fire a Minuteman. In the event
of an attack, Soviet warheads
would arrive to find empty holes
in the North Dakota countryside,
and the only thing left sitting
around for an ABM to protect
would be those missiles which
didn't work.
The only conclusion which we
can rightfully draw from this is
that the Safequard proposal is
grossly and manifestly wasteful of
scarce American money and
talented manpower.
Proponents of the system
claim that the Soviet Union has
already emplaced an ABM system,
and that Safeguard will merely
bring us to parity rather than start
a new spiral in the arms race. That
is nonsense. The Soviet ABM is
emplaced only around Moscow. It
does not protect Soviet missile
bases. It does not protect Soviet
bomber bases. It does not protect
Soviet submarine bases. It merely
"protects" Moscow with a
primitive system comparable to
the old proposed Nike-Zeus
missile defense.
Doom
When we thought we were
confronted with a Soviet ABM we
bought MIRV (several bombs on
one rocket which are
independently targetable), which
more than trebled the number of
warheads in our Minuteman force.
We converted Polaris subs to carry
new Poseidon missiles, which
upped the number of undersea
warheads from 656 to 4,000 or
more. We bought Minuteman 111
to replace I and 11, and we appear
to be ready to proceed with a new
manned bomber (AMSA) carrying
two new missile systems (SCAD)
and SCRAM). When we carried
out this massive buildup in order

to overcome a supposed Soviet
threat, can we expect the Soviets
to do less in the face of
Safeguard? The crux of the
nuclear ' 4 acti on - reaction
phenomena" is that when the U.S.
acts, the Soviet Union reacts, to
which action the U.S. must in
turn react, ad infinitum.
Thus when we start
deployment of the very weapons
which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a
Soviet attack, but rather a strong
inducement for the Soviets to
vastly increase their own offensive
force. That. . .would make it
necessary for us to respond in
turn, and so the arms race would
rush hopelessly on to no sensible
purpose on either side."
Willingness
This inflammatory action
couldn't come at a more critical
time. The Soviets signed the
nonproliferation treaty, have
indicated a willingness to
negotiate the Middle East
situation, and have dropped their
twenty year insistence on talks for
complete disarmament in favor of
the piecemeal negotiations on
missile systems which the United
States has long desired. Even
cancelling military participation in
their May Day parade is another
indication of the fact that the
Societs are finally ready to
negotiate in earnest a mutually
beneficial halt to the
thermonuclear arms race. Such an
agreement is clearly in the best
interests of both parties. Both
nations can destroy the world
already and have reached a
relative parity in delivery systems.
The Soviets can destroy us
whenever they want, as long as
they're willing to be destroyed in
return, and vice versa. This
reciprocity of destructive
potential is a stable situation, and
one which neither side will allow
to be upset through the
construction of either offensive or
defensive weapons —hence the
futility of even trying to upset
that balance. Both nations greatly
need the savings from an arms
freeze for other important
uses —the U.S.S.R. would rather
worry about Red China, and we
had better worry about our cities.
In this situation it is an act of
unbounded negligence to provoke
the Soviet Union into another
spiral of the arms race (the last
one lasted fifteen years and cost
us alone about $500 billion
dollars before reaching the present
parity). The President seems
determined to punt on first down
from midfield, and Americans
must prevent his callously
throwing away a chance at
stopping the production of more
useless overkill.
W inning
The introduction of the idea of
defense in strategic nuclear
calculations is another dangerous
offspring of ABM. Up until now
there has been no prospect of
"winning" a nuclear war because
there is no defense whatsoever
against an enemy attack. When we
build defensive systems, then
generals on both sides can start
thinking about "winning"a
nuclear war with a good defense.
When that happens the prospects
that someone will try to win
sohietime becomes frighteningly
real. Whether that person will be a
Stalin, a Goldwater, or a
Strangelove is of no moment. The
arguments for attempting a
nuclear war will sit in the world's
ABM silos.
The most immediate danger of
Safeguard is the threat it poses to
the quality of American life. We
are told that stopping pollution,

Richard Breeilon

rebuilding our cities, easing traffic
congestion, feeding the hungry,
and closing the gap between the
rich nations and the absymally
poor must wait for want of funds.
Yet we can blithely proceed to
procure PAR, MSR, MIRV,
AMS A , SCAD, SCRAM
SPARTAN, SPRINT, and all the
rest of what Senator George
McGovern refers to as "little more
than a gigantic make-work welfare
project sponsored by the
military-industrial complex." Over
three thousand companies in the
defense field stand to profit from
the ABM deployment, and they
are using their influence
accordingly. ABM will provide
many aerospace companies with a
convenient post-Apollo program
government largesse, and one
which is potentially open-minded.
It would be difficult to devise a
better example of the
military-industrial complex hard
at work entrenching itself still
further into American life.
Priorities
If we spend our resources on
ABM instead of on the neglected
domestic threats to our human
values we may find that we have
constructed a "Great Wall of
America" but left ourselves bereft
of anything to protect. The brown
cloud residing over riot-town
American metropolitan cities is
more important than non-defense
of Montana. Good education and
decent housing for all American
children is more important than
decorating what would be empty
silos in North Dakota with ABM's.
We must decide which of these
priorities we are going to adopt as
a nation, and then act
accordingly.
While Dwight Eisenhower was
President of Columbia University
he said that he was not interested
in preserving lives or property, but
rather in protecting a way of life.
Safeguard attempts to protect
lives and property, but in the
process will threaten our way of
life.
It seems incredibly far-fetched
that the United States could take
such a course of action with all its
concomitant results while facing
potential death, degradation, and
revolution within the very walls it
hopes to erect. Such an action
must be opposed! With the latest
poll showing the Senate split
51-49 in favor of Safeguard with
only a few weeks before final
determination of the issue, it is
incumbent on every American to
voice his opposition to this plan
and write his Senator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William 0. Douglas summed up
his opposition, and the entire case
against the ABM by saying, "I am
not an expert, but my lay
judgment is that the manufacture
of the missile defense systems will
make the military-industrial
complex rich, will result in the
production of huge piles of junk,
and will be meaningless in terms
of survival."

The introduction of the idea of

accordingly. ABM will provide

If we spend our resources on

American metropolitan cities is
more important than non-defense
of Montana. Good education and

51-49 in favor of Safeguard with
only a few weeks before final
determination of the issue, it is

his opposition, and the entire case
against the ABM by saying, "I am

WRITE NOW!
(Richard Hreedon is a freshman
in General Studies—Ed.)
In defiance of the new
Nonproliferation Treaty, in
dcfiance of logic, and in defiance
of common sense, President
Nixon stood before a press
conference in March and
announced that the United States
would proceed to deploy the
Safequard antiballistic missile
system (ABM). The U.S. has a
reputation for doing and saying
some very stupid things in the
international field, but with this
decision we have far exceeded
even our own capacity for
blunder. The President's judgment
to deploy the ABM may well be
the most important decision of
the nuclear age, and if left
unblocked by the Congress may
prove to be the single greatest
monument to shortsightedness
and idiocy the U.S. has ever
created.
There are a great many reasons
for opposing the ABM. Opponents
can and have written hundreds of
pages explaining their resistance
to Stanford, but most simply put,
ABM will be ineffective, wasteful,
and highly dangerous.
Ineffective due to
impracticality, Safeguard
probably won't work any better
than a trip to the moon on
gossamer wings. Former Secretary
of Defense Robert S. McNamara
summed up the practicality
argument by saying, "Every ABM
system that is now feasible
involves firing defensive missiles at
incoming offensive warheads in an
effort to destroy them. Any such
system can rather obviously be
defeated by an enemy simply
sending more offensive warheads
or dummy warheads, than there
are defensive missiles capable of
disposing of them . . .Were we to
deploy an . . .ABM system
throughout the U.S.A. the Soviets
would clearly be strongly
motivated to so increase their
offensive capability as to cancel
out our defensive advantage."
Overwhelming
In addition to overwhelming the
system the Soviets could confuse
it with decoy warheads and
electronic scrambling of American
radar signals. They could also use
chemical or biological warheads
which can't be defused by an
ABM. These obvious objections
from a practicality standpoint are
aggravated by technical
incapacities in the system. There
are numerous scientific grounds
for believing that Safeguard will

be like the ship which slid down
the ways and sank at its
launching.
Foremost among these
problems is the effect of nuclear
"blackout." Once one warhead
goes off in a given area U.S. radars
will no longer be able to track
Soviet warheads in that sector due
to the cloud of ionized gas which
the explosion creates. This will
blind the whole system, and
prevent it from working. The ease
with which our ABM could be
circumvented because of its
impracticality was expressed by
Simon Ramo, Vice-president of
TRW Systems, Inc. (maker of at
least part of almost every
American satellite and rocket),
when he said that with "one-tenth
of the budget of ABM, thick or
thin, I could wreck the system."
Thus the ABM would probably
join that proud and illustrious
group of American weapons
systems that didn't work right
when they had to. Recent
members of this club have
included the F-1118, M-16 rifle,
and Sheridan reconnaissance tank.
Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery
rather than design.
Incapable
The system is not only
incapable of handling a heavy
Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were
to have time to fire an ABM in
some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our
Minutemen, rather than leaving
them in their silos to be blown up.
It takes thirty to forty-five
minutes for a Soviet ICBM to
reach the United States, but it
only requires thirty-two seconds
to fire a Minuteman. In the event
of an attack, Soviet warheads
would arrive to find empty holes
in the North Dakota countryside,
and the only thing left sitting
around for an ABM to protect
would be those missiles which
didn't work.
The only conclusion which we
can rightfully draw from this is
that the Safequard proposal is
grossly and manifestly wasteful of
scarce American money and
talented manpower.
Proponents of the system
claim that the Soviet Union has
already emplaced an ABM system,
and that Safeguard will merely
bring us to parity rather than start
a new spiral in the arms race. That
is nonsense. The Soviet ABM is
emplaced only around Moscow. It
does not protect Soviet missile
bases. It does not protect Soviet
bomber bases. It does not protect
Soviet submarine bases. It merely
"protects" Moscow with a
primitive system comparable to
the old proposed Nike-Zeus
missile defense.
Doom
When we thought we were
confronted with a Soviet ABM we
bought MIRV (several bombs on
one rocket which are
independently targetable), which
more than trebled the number of
warheads in our Minuteman force.
We converted Polaris subs to carry
new Poseidon missiles, which
upped the number of undersea
warheads from 656 to 4,000 or
more. We bought Minuteman 111
to replace I and 11, and we appear
to be ready to proceed with a new
manned bomber (AMSA) carrying
two new missile systems (SCAD)
and SCRAM). When we carried
out this massive buildup in order

to overcome a supposed Soviet
threat, can we expect the Soviets
to do less in the face of
Safeguard? The crux of the
nuclear ' 4 acti on - reaction
phenomena" is that when the U.S.
acts, the Soviet Union reacts, to
which action the U.S. must in
turn react, ad infinitum.
Thus when we start
deployment of the very weapons
which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a
Soviet attack, but rather a strong
inducement for the Soviets to
vastly increase their own offensive
force. That. . .would make it
necessary for us to respond in
turn, and so the arms race would
rush hopelessly on to no sensible
purpose on either side."
Willingness
This inflammatory action
couldn't come at a more critical
time. The Soviets signed the
nonproliferation treaty, have
indicated a willingness to
negotiate the Middle East
situation, and have dropped their
twenty year insistence on talks for
complete disarmament in favor of
the piecemeal negotiations on
missile systems which the United
States has long desired. Even
cancelling military participation in
their May Day parade is another
indication of the fact that the
Societs are finally ready to
negotiate in earnest a mutually
beneficial halt to the
thermonuclear arms race. Such an
agreement is clearly in the best
interests of both parties. Both
nations can destroy the world
already and have reached a
relative parity in delivery systems.
The Soviets can destroy us
whenever they want, as long as
they're willing to be destroyed in
return, and vice versa. This
reciprocity of destructive
potential is a stable situation, and
one which neither side will allow
to be upset through the
construction of either offensive or
defensive weapons —hence the
futility of even trying to upset
that balance. Both nations greatly
need the savings from an arms
freeze for other important
uses —the U.S.S.R. would rather

In this situation it is an act of

Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery
rather than design.
Incapable
The system is not only
incapable of handling a heavy
Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were
to have time to fire an ABM in
some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our
Minutemen, rather than leaving
them in their silos to be blown up.
It takes thirty to forty-five
minutes for a Soviet ICBM to
reach the United States, but it
only requires thirty-two seconds
to fire a Minuteman. In the event
of an attack, Soviet warheads
would arrive to find empty holes
in the North Dakota countryside,
and the only thing left sitting
around for an ABM to protect
would be those missiles which
didn't work.
The only conclusion which we
can rightfully draw from this is
that the Safequard proposal is
grossly and manifestly wasteful of
scarce American money and
talented manpower.
Proponents of the system
claim that the Soviet Union has
already emplaced an ABM system,
and that Safeguard will merely
bring us to parity rather than start
a new spiral in the arms race. That
is nonsense. The Soviet ABM is
emplaced only around Moscow. It
does not protect Soviet missile
bases. It does not protect Soviet
bomber bases. It does not protect
Soviet submarine bases. It merely
"protects" Moscow with a
primitive system comparable to
the old proposed Nike-Zeus
missile defense.
Doom
When we thought we were
confronted with a Soviet ABM we
bought MIRV (several bombs on
one rocket which are
independently targetable), which
more than trebled the number of
warheads in our Minuteman force.
We converted Polaris subs to carry
new Poseidon missiles, which
upped the number of undersea
warheads from 656 to 4,000 or
more. We bought Minuteman 111
to replace I and 11, and we appear
to be ready to proceed with a new
manned bomber (AMSA) carrying
two new missile systems (SCAD)
and SCRAM). When we carried
out this massive buildup in order

to overcome a supposed Soviet
threat, can we expect the Soviets
to do less in the face of
Safeguard? The crux of the
nuclear ' 4 acti on - reaction
phenomena" is that when the U.S.
acts, the Soviet Union reacts, to
which action the U.S. must in
turn react, ad infinitum.
Thus when we start
deployment of the very weapons
which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a
Soviet attack, but rather a strong
inducement for the Soviets to
vastly increase their own offensive
force. That. . .would make it
necessary for us to respond in
turn, and so the arms race would
rush hopelessly on to no sensible
purpose on either side."
Willingness
This inflammatory action
couldn't come at a more critical
time. The Soviets signed the
nonproliferation treaty, have
indicated a willingness to
negotiate the Middle East
situation, and have dropped their
twenty year insistence on talks for
complete disarmament in favor of
the piecemeal negotiations on
missile systems which the United
States has long desired. Even
cancelling military participation in
their May Day parade is another
indication of the fact that the
Societs are finally ready to
negotiate in earnest a mutually
beneficial halt to the
thermonuclear arms race. Such an
agreement is clearly in the best
interests of both parties. Both
nations can destroy the world
already and have reached a
relative parity in delivery systems.
The Soviets can destroy us
whenever they want, as long as
they're willing to be destroyed in
return, and vice versa. This
reciprocity of destructive
potential is a stable situation, and
one which neither side will allow
to be upset through the
construction of either offensive or
defensive weapons —hence the
futility of even trying to upset
that balance. Both nations greatly
need the savings from an arms
freeze for other important
uses —the U.S.S.R. would rather
worry about Red China, and we
had better worry about our cities.
In this situation it is an act of
unbounded negligence to provoke
the Soviet Union into another
spiral of the arms race (the last
one lasted fifteen years and cost
us alone about $500 billion
dollars before reaching the present
parity). The President seems
determined to punt on first down
from midfield, and Americans
must prevent his callously
throwing away a chance at
stopping the production of more
useless overkill.
W inning
The introduction of the idea of
defense in strategic nuclear
calculations is another dangerous
offspring of ABM. Up until now
there has been no prospect of
"winning" a nuclear war because
there is no defense whatsoever
against an enemy attack. When we
build defensive systems, then
generals on both sides can start
thinking about "winning"a
nuclear war with a good defense.
When that happens the prospects
that someone will try to win
sohietime becomes frighteningly
real. Whether that person will be a
Stalin, a Goldwater, or a
Strangelove is of no moment. The
arguments for attempting a
nuclear war will sit in the world's
ABM silos.
The most immediate danger of
Safeguard is the threat it poses to
the quality of American life. We
are told that stopping pollution,

Richard Breeilon

rebuilding our cities, easing traffic
congestion, feeding the hungry,
and closing the gap between the
rich nations and the absymally
poor must wait for want of funds.
Yet we can blithely proceed to
procure PAR, MSR, MIRV,
AMS A , SCAD, SCRAM
SPARTAN, SPRINT, and all the
rest of what Senator George
McGovern refers to as "little more
than a gigantic make-work welfare
project sponsored by the
military-industrial complex." Over
three thousand companies in the
defense field stand to profit from
the ABM deployment, and they
are using their influence
accordingly. ABM will provide
many aerospace companies with a
convenient post-Apollo program
government largesse, and one
which is potentially open-minded.
It would be difficult to devise a
better example of the
military-industrial complex hard
at work entrenching itself still
further into American life.
Priorities
If we spend our resources on
ABM instead of on the neglected
domestic threats to our human
values we may find that we have
constructed a "Great Wall of
America" but left ourselves bereft
of anything to protect. The brown
cloud residing over riot-town
American metropolitan cities is
more important than non-defense
of Montana. Good education and
decent housing for all American
children is more important than
decorating what would be empty
silos in North Dakota with ABM's.
We must decide which of these
priorities we are going to adopt as
a nation, and then act
accordingly.
While Dwight Eisenhower was
President of Columbia University
he said that he was not interested
in preserving lives or property, but
rather in protecting a way of life.
Safeguard attempts to protect
lives and property, but in the
process will threaten our way of
life.
It seems incredibly far-fetched
that the United States could take
such a course of action with all its
concomitant results while facing
potential death, degradation, and
revolution within the very walls it
hopes to erect. Such an action
must be opposed! With the latest
poll showing the Senate split
51-49 in favor of Safeguard with
only a few weeks before final
determination of the issue, it is
incumbent on every American to
voice his opposition to this plan
and write his Senator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William 0. Douglas summed up
his opposition, and the entire case
against the ABM by saying, "I am
not an expert, but my lay
judgment is that the manufacture
of the missile defense systems will
make the military-industrial
complex rich, will result in the
production of huge piles of junk,
and will be meaningless in terms
of survival."
WRITE NOW!
(Richard Hreedon is a freshman
in General Studies—Ed.)
In defiance of the new
Nonproliferation Treaty, in
dcfiance of logic, and in defiance
of common sense, President
Nixon stood before a press
conference in March and
announced that the United States
would proceed to deploy the
Safequard antiballistic missile
system (ABM). The U.S. has a
reputation for doing and saying
some very stupid things in the
international field, but with this
decision we have far exceeded
even our own capacity for
blunder. The President's judgment
to deploy the ABM may well be
the most important decision of
the nuclear age, and if left
unblocked by the Congress may
prove to be the single greatest
monument to shortsightedness
and idiocy the U.S. has ever
created.
There are a great many reasons
for opposing the ABM. Opponents
can and have written hundreds of
pages explaining their resistance
to Stanford, but most simply put,
ABM will be ineffective, wasteful,
and highly dangerous.
Ineffective due to
impracticality, Safeguard
probably won't work any better
than a trip to the moon on
gossamer wings. Former Secretary
of Defense Robert S. McNamara
summed up the practicality
argument by saying, "Every ABM
system that is now feasible
involves firing defensive missiles at
incoming offensive warheads in an
effort to destroy them. Any such
system can rather obviously be
defeated by an enemy simply
sending more offensive warheads
or dummy warheads, than there
are defensive missiles capable of
disposing of them . . .Were we to
deploy an . . .ABM system
throughout the U.S.A. the Soviets
would clearly be strongly
motivated to so increase their
offensive capability as to cancel
out our defensive advantage."
Overwhelming
In addition to overwhelming the
system the Soviets could confuse
it with decoy warheads and
electronic scrambling of American
radar signals. They could also use
chemical or biological warheads
which can't be defused by an
ABM. These obvious objections
from a practicality standpoint are
aggravated by technical
incapacities in the system. There
are numerous scientific grounds
for believing that Safeguard will

be like the ship which slid down
the ways and sank at its
launching.
Foremost among these
problems is the effect of nuclear
"blackout." Once one warhead
goes off in a given area U.S. radars
will no longer be able to track
Soviet warheads in that sector due
to the cloud of ionized gas which
the explosion creates. This will
blind the whole system, and
prevent it from working. The ease
with which our ABM could be
circumvented because of its
impracticality was expressed by
Simon Ramo, Vice-president of
TRW Systems, Inc. (maker of at
least part of almost every
American satellite and rocket),
when he said that with "one-tenth
of the budget of ABM, thick or
thin, I could wreck the system."
Thus the ABM would probably
join that proud and illustrious
group of American weapons
systems that didn't work right
when they had to. Recent
members of this club have
included the F-1118, M-16 rifle,
and Sheridan reconnaissance tank.
Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery

Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were

some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our

WRITE NOW!
(Richard Hreedon is a freshman
in General Studies—Ed.)
In defiance of the new
Nonproliferation Treaty, in
dcfiance of logic, and in defiance
of common sense, President
Nixon stood before a press
conference in March and
announced that the United States
would proceed to deploy the
Safequard antiballistic missile
system (ABM). The U.S. has a
reputation for doing and saying
some very stupid things in the
international field, but with this
decision we have far exceeded
even our own capacity for
blunder. The President's judgment
to deploy the ABM may well be
the most important decision of
the nuclear age, and if left
unblocked by the Congress may
prove to be the single greatest
monument to shortsightedness
and idiocy the U.S. has ever
created.
There are a great many reasons
for opposing the ABM. Opponents
can and have written hundreds of
pages explaining their resistance
to Stanford, but most simply put,
ABM will be ineffective, wasteful,
and highly dangerous.
Ineffective due to
impracticality, Safeguard
probably won't work any better
than a trip to the moon on
gossamer wings. Former Secretary
of Defense Robert S. McNamara
summed up the practicality
argument by saying, "Every ABM
system that is now feasible
involves firing defensive missiles at
incoming offensive warheads in an
effort to destroy them. Any such
system can rather obviously be
defeated by an enemy simply
sending more offensive warheads
or dummy warheads, than there
are defensive missiles capable of
disposing of them . . .Were we to
deploy an . . .ABM system
throughout the U.S.A. the Soviets
would clearly be strongly
motivated to so increase their
offensive capability as to cancel
out our defensive advantage."
Overwhelming
In addition to overwhelming the
system the Soviets could confuse
it with decoy warheads and
electronic scrambling of American
radar signals. They could also use
chemical or biological warheads
which can't be defused by an
ABM. These obvious objections
from a practicality standpoint are
aggravated by technical
incapacities in the system. There
are numerous scientific grounds
for believing that Safeguard will

be like the ship which slid down
the ways and sank at its
launching.
Foremost among these
problems is the effect of nuclear
"blackout." Once one warhead
goes off in a given area U.S. radars
will no longer be able to track
Soviet warheads in that sector due
to the cloud of ionized gas which
the explosion creates. This will
blind the whole system, and
prevent it from working. The ease
with which our ABM could be
circumvented because of its
impracticality was expressed by
Simon Ramo, Vice-president of
TRW Systems, Inc. (maker of at
least part of almost every
American satellite and rocket),
when he said that with "one-tenth
of the budget of ABM, thick or
thin, I could wreck the system."
Thus the ABM would probably
join that proud and illustrious
group of American weapons
systems that didn't work right
when they had to. Recent
members of this club have
included the F-1118, M-16 rifle,
and Sheridan reconnaissance tank.
Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery
rather than design.
Incapable
The system is not only
incapable of handling a heavy
Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were
to have time to fire an ABM in
some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our
Minutemen, rather than leaving
them in their silos to be blown up.
It takes thirty to forty-five
minutes for a Soviet ICBM to
reach the United States, but it
only requires thirty-two seconds
to fire a Minuteman. In the event
of an attack, Soviet warheads
would arrive to find empty holes
in the North Dakota countryside,
and the only thing left sitting
around for an ABM to protect
would be those missiles which
didn't work.
The only conclusion which we
can rightfully draw from this is
that the Safequard proposal is
grossly and manifestly wasteful of
scarce American money and
talented manpower.
Proponents of the system
claim that the Soviet Union has
already emplaced an ABM system,
and that Safeguard will merely
bring us to parity rather than start
a new spiral in the arms race. That
is nonsense. The Soviet ABM is
emplaced only around Moscow. It
does not protect Soviet missile
bases. It does not protect Soviet
bomber bases. It does not protect
Soviet submarine bases. It merely
"protects" Moscow with a
primitive system comparable to
the old proposed Nike-Zeus
missile defense.
Doom
When we thought we were
confronted with a Soviet ABM we
bought MIRV (several bombs on
one rocket which are
independently targetable), which
more than trebled the number of
warheads in our Minuteman force.
We converted Polaris subs to carry
new Poseidon missiles, which
upped the number of undersea
warheads from 656 to 4,000 or
more. We bought Minuteman 111
to replace I and 11, and we appear
to be ready to proceed with a new
manned bomber (AMSA) carrying
two new missile systems (SCAD)
and SCRAM). When we carried
out this massive buildup in order

to overcome a supposed Soviet
threat, can we expect the Soviets
to do less in the face of
Safeguard? The crux of the
nuclear ' 4 acti on - reaction
phenomena" is that when the U.S.
acts, the Soviet Union reacts, to
which action the U.S. must in
turn react, ad infinitum.
Thus when we start
deployment of the very weapons
which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a
Soviet attack, but rather a strong
inducement for the Soviets to
vastly increase their own offensive
force. That. . .would make it
necessary for us to respond in
turn, and so the arms race would
rush hopelessly on to no sensible
purpose on either side."
Willingness
This inflammatory action
couldn't come at a more critical
time. The Soviets signed the
nonproliferation treaty, have
indicated a willingness to
negotiate the Middle East
situation, and have dropped their
twenty year insistence on talks for
complete disarmament in favor of
the piecemeal negotiations on
missile systems which the United
States has long desired. Even
cancelling military participation in
their May Day parade is another
indication of the fact that the
Societs are finally ready to
negotiate in earnest a mutually
beneficial halt to the
thermonuclear arms race. Such an
agreement is clearly in the best
interests of both parties. Both
nations can destroy the world
already and have reached a
relative parity in delivery systems.
The Soviets can destroy us
whenever they want, as long as
they're willing to be destroyed in
return, and vice versa. This
reciprocity of destructive
potential is a stable situation, and
one which neither side will allow
to be upset through the
construction of either offensive or
defensive weapons —hence the
futility of even trying to upset
that balance. Both nations greatly
need the savings from an arms
freeze for other important
uses —the U.S.S.R. would rather
worry about Red China, and we
had better worry about our cities.
In this situation it is an act of
unbounded negligence to provoke
the Soviet Union into another
spiral of the arms race (the last
one lasted fifteen years and cost
us alone about $500 billion
dollars before reaching the present
parity). The President seems
determined to punt on first down
from midfield, and Americans
must prevent his callously
throwing away a chance at
stopping the production of more
useless overkill.
W inning
The introduction of the idea of
defense in strategic nuclear
calculations is another dangerous
offspring of ABM. Up until now
there has been no prospect of
"winning" a nuclear war because
there is no defense whatsoever
against an enemy attack. When we
build defensive systems, then
generals on both sides can start
thinking about "winning"a
nuclear war with a good defense.
When that happens the prospects
that someone will try to win
sohietime becomes frighteningly
real. Whether that person will be a
Stalin, a Goldwater, or a
Strangelove is of no moment. The
arguments for attempting a
nuclear war will sit in the world's
ABM silos.
The most immediate danger of
Safeguard is the threat it poses to
the quality of American life. We
are told that stopping pollution,

Richard Breeilon

rebuilding our cities, easing traffic
congestion, feeding the hungry,
and closing the gap between the
rich nations and the absymally
poor must wait for want of funds.
Yet we can blithely proceed to
procure PAR, MSR, MIRV,
AMS A , SCAD, SCRAM
SPARTAN, SPRINT, and all the
rest of what Senator George
McGovern refers to as "little more
than a gigantic make-work welfare
project sponsored by the
military-industrial complex." Over
three thousand companies in the
defense field stand to profit from
the ABM deployment, and they
are using their influence
accordingly. ABM will provide
many aerospace companies with a
convenient post-Apollo program
government largesse, and one
which is potentially open-minded.
It would be difficult to devise a
better example of the
military-industrial complex hard
at work entrenching itself still
further into American life.
Priorities
If we spend our resources on
ABM instead of on the neglected
domestic threats to our human
values we may find that we have
constructed a "Great Wall of
America" but left ourselves bereft
of anything to protect. The brown
cloud residing over riot-town
American metropolitan cities is
more important than non-defense
of Montana. Good education and
decent housing for all American
children is more important than
decorating what would be empty
silos in North Dakota with ABM's.
We must decide which of these
priorities we are going to adopt as
a nation, and then act
accordingly.
While Dwight Eisenhower was

he said that he was not interested

which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a
Soviet attack, but rather a strong
inducement for the Soviets to
vastly increase their own offensive

necessary for us to respond in

rush hopelessly on to no sensible

Willingness
This inflammatory action
couldn't come at a more critical
time. The Soviets signed the
nonproliferation treaty, have
indicated a willingness to
negotiate the Middle East
situation, and have dropped their
twenty year insistence on talks for
complete disarmament in favor of
the piecemeal negotiations on
missile systems which the United
States has long desired. Even
cancelling military participation in
their May Day parade is another
indication of the fact that the
Societs are finally ready to
negotiate in earnest a mutually
beneficial halt to the
thermonuclear arms race. Such an
agreement is clearly in the best
interests of both parties. Both
nations can destroy the world
already and have reached a
relative parity in delivery systems.
The Soviets can destroy us
whenever they want, as long as
they're willing to be destroyed in
return, and vice versa. This
reciprocity of destructive
potential is a stable situation, and
one which neither side will allow
to be upset through the
construction of either offensive or
defensive weapons —hence the
futility of even trying to upset
that balance. Both nations greatly
need the savings from an arms
freeze for other important
uses —the U.S.S.R. would rather
worry about Red China, and we
had better worry about our cities.
In this situation it is an act of
unbounded negligence to provoke
the Soviet Union into another
spiral of the arms race (the last
one lasted fifteen years and cost
us alone about $500 billion
dollars before reaching the present
parity). The President seems
determined to punt on first down
from midfield, and Americans
must prevent his callously
throwing away a chance at
stopping the production of more
useless overkill.
W inning
The introduction of the idea of
defense in strategic nuclear
calculations is another dangerous
offspring of ABM. Up until now
there has been no prospect of
"winning" a nuclear war because
there is no defense whatsoever
against an enemy attack. When we
build defensive systems, then
generals on both sides can start
thinking about "winning"a
nuclear war with a good defense.
When that happens the prospects
that someone will try to win
sohietime becomes frighteningly
real. Whether that person will be a
Stalin, a Goldwater, or a
Strangelove is of no moment. The
arguments for attempting a
nuclear war will sit in the world's
ABM silos.
The most immediate danger of
Safeguard is the threat it poses to
the quality of American life. We
are told that stopping pollution,

rebuilding our cities, easing traffic
congestion, feeding the hungry,
and closing the gap between the
rich nations and the absymally
poor must wait for want of funds.
Yet we can blithely proceed to

AMS A , SCAD, SCRAM
SPARTAN, SPRINT, and all the
rest of what Senator George
McGovern refers to as "little more
than a gigantic make-work welfare
project sponsored by the
military-industrial complex." Over
three thousand companies in the
defense field stand to profit from
the ABM deployment, and they
are using their influence
accordingly. ABM will provide
many aerospace companies with a
convenient post-Apollo program
government largesse, and one
which is potentially open-minded.
It would be difficult to devise a
better example of the
military-industrial complex hard
at work entrenching itself still
further into American life.
Priorities
If we spend our resources on
ABM instead of on the neglected
domestic threats to our human
values we may find that we have
constructed a "Great Wall of
America" but left ourselves bereft
of anything to protect. The brown
cloud residing over riot-town
American metropolitan cities is
more important than non-defense
of Montana. Good education and
decent housing for all American
children is more important than
decorating what would be empty

We must decide which of these
priorities we are going to adopt as
a nation, and then act

While Dwight Eisenhower was
President of Columbia University
he said that he was not interested

Safeguard attempts to protect

such a course of action with all its
concomitant results while facing
potential death, degradation, and
revolution within the very walls it
hopes to erect. Such an action
must be opposed! With the latest

51-49 in favor of Safeguard with
only a few weeks before final
determination of the issue, it is
incumbent on every American to

his opposition, and the entire case
against the ABM by saying, "I am

WRITE NOW!
(Richard Hreedon is a freshman
in General Studies—Ed.)
In defiance of the new
Nonproliferation Treaty, in
dcfiance of logic, and in defiance
of common sense, President
Nixon stood before a press
conference in March and
announced that the United States
would proceed to deploy the
Safequard antiballistic missile
system (ABM). The U.S. has a
reputation for doing and saying
some very stupid things in the
international field, but with this
decision we have far exceeded
even our own capacity for
blunder. The President's judgment
to deploy the ABM may well be
the most important decision of
the nuclear age, and if left
unblocked by the Congress may
prove to be the single greatest
monument to shortsightedness
and idiocy the U.S. has ever
created.
There are a great many reasons
for opposing the ABM. Opponents
can and have written hundreds of
pages explaining their resistance
to Stanford, but most simply put,
ABM will be ineffective, wasteful,
and highly dangerous.
Ineffective due to
impracticality, Safeguard
probably won't work any better
than a trip to the moon on
gossamer wings. Former Secretary
of Defense Robert S. McNamara
summed up the practicality
argument by saying, "Every ABM
system that is now feasible
involves firing defensive missiles at
incoming offensive warheads in an
effort to destroy them. Any such
system can rather obviously be
defeated by an enemy simply
sending more offensive warheads
or dummy warheads, than there
are defensive missiles capable of
disposing of them . . .Were we to
deploy an . . .ABM system
throughout the U.S.A. the Soviets
would clearly be strongly
motivated to so increase their
offensive capability as to cancel
out our defensive advantage."
Overwhelming
In addition to overwhelming the
system the Soviets could confuse
it with decoy warheads and
electronic scrambling of American
radar signals. They could also use
chemical or biological warheads
which can't be defused by an
ABM. These obvious objections
from a practicality standpoint are
aggravated by technical
incapacities in the system. There
are numerous scientific grounds
for believing that Safeguard will

be like the ship which slid down
the ways and sank at its
launching.
Foremost among these
problems is the effect of nuclear
"blackout." Once one warhead
goes off in a given area U.S. radars
will no longer be able to track
Soviet warheads in that sector due
to the cloud of ionized gas which
the explosion creates. This will
blind the whole system, and
prevent it from working. The ease
with which our ABM could be
circumvented because of its
impracticality was expressed by
Simon Ramo, Vice-president of
TRW Systems, Inc. (maker of at
least part of almost every
American satellite and rocket),
when he said that with "one-tenth
of the budget of ABM, thick or
thin, I could wreck the system."
Thus the ABM would probably
join that proud and illustrious
group of American weapons
systems that didn't work right
when they had to. Recent
members of this club have
included the F-1118, M-16 rifle,
and Sheridan reconnaissance tank.
Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery
rather than design.
Incapable
The system is not only
incapable of handling a heavy
Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were
to have time to fire an ABM in
some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our
Minutemen, rather than leaving
them in their silos to be blown up.
It takes thirty to forty-five
minutes for a Soviet ICBM to
reach the United States, but it
only requires thirty-two seconds
to fire a Minuteman. In the event
of an attack, Soviet warheads
would arrive to find empty holes
in the North Dakota countryside,
and the only thing left sitting
around for an ABM to protect
would be those missiles which
didn't work.
The only conclusion which we
can rightfully draw from this is
that the Safequard proposal is
grossly and manifestly wasteful of
scarce American money and
talented manpower.
Proponents of the system
claim that the Soviet Union has
already emplaced an ABM system,
and that Safeguard will merely
bring us to parity rather than start
a new spiral in the arms race. That
is nonsense. The Soviet ABM is
emplaced only around Moscow. It
does not protect Soviet missile
bases. It does not protect Soviet
bomber bases. It does not protect
Soviet submarine bases. It merely
"protects" Moscow with a
primitive system comparable to
the old proposed Nike-Zeus
missile defense.
Doom
When we thought we were
confronted with a Soviet ABM we
bought MIRV (several bombs on
one rocket which are
independently targetable), which
more than trebled the number of
warheads in our Minuteman force.
We converted Polaris subs to carry
new Poseidon missiles, which
upped the number of undersea
warheads from 656 to 4,000 or
more. We bought Minuteman 111
to replace I and 11, and we appear
to be ready to proceed with a new
manned bomber (AMSA) carrying
two new missile systems (SCAD)
and SCRAM). When we carried
out this massive buildup in order

to overcome a supposed Soviet
threat, can we expect the Soviets
to do less in the face of
Safeguard? The crux of the
nuclear ' 4 acti on - reaction
phenomena" is that when the U.S.
acts, the Soviet Union reacts, to
which action the U.S. must in
turn react, ad infinitum.
Thus when we start
deployment of the very weapons
which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a

radar signals. They could also use
chemical or biological warheads
which can't be defused by an
ABM. These obvious objections
from a practicality standpoint are
aggravated by technical
incapacities in the system. There
are numerous scientific grounds
for believing that Safeguard will

be like the ship which slid down
the ways and sank at its
launching.
Foremost among these
problems is the effect of nuclear
"blackout." Once one warhead
goes off in a given area U.S. radars
will no longer be able to track
Soviet warheads in that sector due
to the cloud of ionized gas which
the explosion creates. This will
blind the whole system, and
prevent it from working. The ease
with which our ABM could be
circumvented because of its
impracticality was expressed by
Simon Ramo, Vice-president of
TRW Systems, Inc. (maker of at
least part of almost every
American satellite and rocket),
when he said that with "one-tenth
of the budget of ABM, thick or
thin, I could wreck the system."
Thus the ABM would probably
join that proud and illustrious
group of American weapons
systems that didn't work right
when they had to. Recent
members of this club have
included the F-1118, M-16 rifle,
and Sheridan reconnaissance tank.
Most prestigious of this club
remains the Nike air-defense
system against Soviet bombers
which we paid $50 billion for in
the 50's, and which later proved
to have been full of holes. ABM
threatens to be the Baby Huey of
this entire group, however, for
with its inevitable price tag it
should win accolades as the "grea
test waste" of a wasteful decade.
The Brookings Institute has
estimated ABM's final cost at
$400 billion, and though this
estimate is probably too high,
$50-100 billion seems credible as
a final cost based on delivery
rather than design.
Incapable
The system is not only
incapable of handling a heavy
Soviet attack, but is unnecessary
for that role anyway. If we were
to have time to fire an ABM in
some future attack, then we
would also have time to fire our
Minutemen, rather than leaving
them in their silos to be blown up.
It takes thirty to forty-five
minutes for a Soviet ICBM to
reach the United States, but it
only requires thirty-two seconds
to fire a Minuteman. In the event
of an attack, Soviet warheads
would arrive to find empty holes
in the North Dakota countryside,
and the only thing left sitting
around for an ABM to protect
would be those missiles which
didn't work.
The only conclusion which we
can rightfully draw from this is
that the Safequard proposal is
grossly and manifestly wasteful of
scarce American money and
talented manpower.
Proponents of the system
claim that the Soviet Union has
already emplaced an ABM system,
and that Safeguard will merely
bring us to parity rather than start
a new spiral in the arms race. That
is nonsense. The Soviet ABM is
emplaced only around Moscow. It
does not protect Soviet missile
bases. It does not protect Soviet
bomber bases. It does not protect
Soviet submarine bases. It merely
"protects" Moscow with a
primitive system comparable to
the old proposed Nike-Zeus
missile defense.
Doom
When we thought we were
confronted with a Soviet ABM we
bought MIRV (several bombs on
one rocket which are
independently targetable), which
more than trebled the number of
warheads in our Minuteman force.
We converted Polaris subs to carry
new Poseidon missiles, which
upped the number of undersea
warheads from 656 to 4,000 or
more. We bought Minuteman 111
to replace I and 11, and we appear
to be ready to proceed with a new
manned bomber (AMSA) carrying
two new missile systems (SCAD)
and SCRAM). When we carried
out this massive buildup in order

to overcome a supposed Soviet
threat, can we expect the Soviets
to do less in the face of
Safeguard? The crux of the
nuclear ' 4 acti on - reaction
phenomena" is that when the U.S.
acts, the Soviet Union reacts, to
which action the U.S. must in
turn react, ad infinitum.
Thus when we start
deployment of the very weapons
which we want and need to
preclude building through
negotiations (MIRV and ABM),
we effectively doom those
negotiations to failure by forcing
the Soviets to embark on costly
weapons programs in response to
us. McNamara concluded that a
Soviet-oriented system would "be
no adequate shield at all against a
Soviet attack, but rather a strong
inducement for the Soviets to
vastly increase their own offensive
force. That. . .would make it
necessary for us to respond in
turn, and so the arms race would
rush hopelessly on to no sensible
purpose on either side."
Willingness
This inflammatory action
couldn't come at a more critical
time. The Soviets signed the
nonproliferation treaty, have
indicated a willingness to
negotiate the Middle East
situation, and have dropped their
twenty year insistence on talks for
complete disarmament in favor of
the piecemeal negotiations on
missile systems which the United
States has long desired. Even
cancelling military participation in
their May Day parade is another
indication of the fact that the
Societs are finally ready to
negotiate in earnest a mutually
beneficial halt to the
thermonuclear arms race. Such an
agreement is clearly in the best
interests of both parties. Both
nations can destroy the world
already and have reached a
relative parity in delivery systems.
The Soviets can destroy us
whenever they want, as long as
they're willing to be destroyed in
return, and vice versa. This
reciprocity of destructive
potential is a stable situation, and
one which neither side will allow
to be upset through the
construction of either offensive or
defensive weapons —hence the
futility of even trying to upset
that balance. Both nations greatly
need the savings from an arms
freeze for other important
uses —the U.S.S.R. would rather
worry about Red China, and we
had better worry about our cities.
In this situation it is an act of
unbounded negligence to provoke
the Soviet Union into another
spiral of the arms race (the last
one lasted fifteen years and cost
us alone about $500 billion
dollars before reaching the present
parity). The President seems
determined to punt on first down
from midfield, and Americans
must prevent his callously
throwing away a chance at
stopping the production of more
useless overkill.
W inning
The introduction of the idea of
defense in strategic nuclear
calculations is another dangerous
offspring of ABM. Up until now
there has been no prospect of
"winning" a nuclear war because
there is no defense whatsoever
against an enemy attack. When we
build defensive systems, then
generals on both sides can start
thinking about "winning"a
nuclear war with a good defense.
When that happens the prospects
that someone will try to win
sohietime becomes frighteningly
real. Whether that person will be a
Stalin, a Goldwater, or a
Strangelove is of no moment. The
arguments for attempting a
nuclear war will sit in the world's
ABM silos.
The most immediate danger of
Safeguard is the threat it poses to
the quality of American life. We
are told that stopping pollution,

rebuilding our cities, easing traffic
congestion, feeding the hungry,
and closing the gap between the
rich nations and the absymally
poor must wait for want of funds.
Yet we can blithely proceed to
procure PAR, MSR, MIRV,
AMS A , SCAD, SCRAM
SPARTAN, SPRINT, and all the
rest of what Senator George
McGovern refers to as "little more
than a gigantic make-work welfare
project sponsored by the
military-industrial complex." Over
three thousand companies in the
defense field stand to profit from
the ABM deployment, and they
are using their influence
accordingly. ABM will provide
many aerospace companies with a
convenient post-Apollo program
government largesse, and one
which is potentially open-minded.
It would be difficult to devise a
better example of the
military-industrial complex hard
at work entrenching itself still
further into American life.
Priorities
If we spend our resources on
ABM instead of on the neglected
domestic threats to our human
values we may find that we have
constructed a "Great Wall of
America" but left ourselves bereft
of anything to protect. The brown
cloud residing over riot-town
American metropolitan cities is
more important than non-defense
of Montana. Good education and
decent housing for all American
children is more important than
decorating what would be empty
silos in North Dakota with ABM's.
We must decide which of these
priorities we are going to adopt as
a nation, and then act
accordingly.
While Dwight Eisenhower was
President of Columbia University
he said that he was not interested
in preserving lives or property, but
rather in protecting a way of life.
Safeguard attempts to protect
lives and property, but in the
process will threaten our way of
life.
It seems incredibly far-fetched
that the United States could take
such a course of action with all its
concomitant results while facing
potential death, degradation, and
revolution within the very walls it
hopes to erect. Such an action
must be opposed! With the latest
poll showing the Senate split
51-49 in favor of Safeguard with
only a few weeks before final
determination of the issue, it is
incumbent on every American to
voice his opposition to this plan
and write his Senator.
U.S. Supreme Court Justice
William 0. Douglas summed up
his opposition, and the entire case
against the ABM by saying, "I am
not an expert, but my lay
judgment is that the manufacture
of the missile defense systems will
make the military-industrial
complex rich, will result in the
production of huge piles of junk,
and will be meaningless in terms
of survival."
