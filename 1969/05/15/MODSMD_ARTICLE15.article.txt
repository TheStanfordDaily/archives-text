## Chlorine Gas Cries Out For Scrutiny 
### 
Chlorine is a poisonous gas. Its
chemical reactivity is so high that
it cannot long persist in nature,
being rapidly converted to the
innocuous chloride ion, the form
in which it is most abundantly
found as, for example, in common
salt. It is an extremely important
industrial chemical playing an
i ndispensible role in the
production of plastics, drugs,
pigments, and many other organic
materials. In the form of sodium
hypochloride, domestic bleach
solution, it is a well known
household article. It also plays an
in dispensible role in the
purification of our water supplies.
We are so accustomed to meeting
it in our environment, that we
hardly notice it except when
someone has zealously overdosed
his swimming pool.
The chlorination of water
supplies was first adopted in the
United States just 60 years ago in
Jersey City. Its use spread very
rapidly thereafter for the
disinfection of public water
supplies and a large proportion of
the total drinking water in this
country is, of course, treated in
this way today. This public health
measure is undoubtedly the major
bulwark against epidemics of
typhoid fever, dysentery, and

cholera, and it would be
conservative to say that millions
of lives have been saved by its
promulgation. In fact,
concentrated urban settlement
would be impractical without
chlorination or some equivalent
means of removing polluting
bacteria from domestic water.
Chlorine was in fact used for
the treatment of sewage since
1835, long before the work of
Pasteur and Koch had shown that
infectious disease was an attack
upon the human body by living
microbes. The rationale was the
dissipation of foul odors which
were, for many years, blamed for
contagion.
Introduction
Chlorine was first introduced
in the water works of Jersey City
in response to potential
contamination by sewage from
some other small towns above it.
The city demanded that the water
company install expensive
filtration equipment or pay for
diversion of the sewage.
After considerable litigation
the court found that the
chlorination process was both safe
and effective for the production
of potable water.
It is difficult to reconstruct the
arguments that would support the

safety of chlorination by
contemporary standards. A few
tests of acute toxicity did show
that chlorinated water can be
administered in concentrations of
50 to 100 parts per million, by
comparison with the 1 to 2 PPM
generally required for water
purification. Furthermore, during
World War I, chlorine, under the
name of Dakin's solution, was the
only available disinfectant for the
contaminated wounds and it did a
heroic job by the standards of the
day.

This article is not a scare-story
about a newly discovered hazard
of an ingredient to which most of
us have been constantly exposed
to since birth. It is rather a
reminder that almost no attention
has been given to the subject of
chronic toxicity from chlorine.
Perhaps we sense such a
dependance on the chlorine
disinfection of water for the
prevention of rampant disease
that we prefer not to be
embarrassed by information about
relatively minor side effects. This
view is not, however, likely to be
defended as a rational basis for
social policy.

The only serious contribution
to the subject that I could find
appeared in 1968, by a German
scientist, Dr. H. Druckrey, of the
Max Planck Institute for
Immunobiology at Freiburg. He
reared a group of laboratory rats
for 7 successive generations on
drinking water supplemented with
100 PPM of chlorine. The treated
animals showed no obvious
pathology nor shortening of
life-span compared to the
controls. This is an impressive
demonstration that should have
been made at least 50 years
earlier.
Suspicions
Many theoretical suspicions
nevertheless remain. One
argument for chlorine is its rapid
removal by reaction with organic
material in body fluids. These
reactions have, however, not been
studied with modern methods. We
have no clear picture of the place,
manner, intermediate products, or
rate by which chlorine is
converted into chloride ion within
the body. These experiments
would not be very difficult to
carry out with the help of
radioactive tracers today.
What little we do know of the

chemistry of chlorine reactions is
portentous. It should sometimes
react with nitrogenous groups
from various sources to form
substances that may eventually
reach and react with the genetic
material, DNA, of body cells. At
the present time this is only a
speculation. In any case it would
probably be applicable only to
heavily contaminated waters
needing heavy doses of chlorine.
The reactions of chlorine with
DNA have been remarkably little
studied. In my own search in the
literature L found only a single
oblique reference. Chlorine,
casually compared with iodine,
rapidly inactivated DNA that had
been isolated from bacteria.
Scrutiny
We know little more of the
mechanism by which chlorine
performs its intended function of
killing bacteria. The scanty data
suggest that the most likely
mechanism is precisely by attack
on the DNA of the microbe. That
chlorine is also intended to
inactivate viruses should provoke
questions about the production of
mutations in view of the close
chemical similarity between
viruses and genes. Many

Joshua Lederberg

geneticists have raised cautions
about chemicals that may cause
mutations, and I will join them by
adding chlorine to the lengthy list
that cry out for close scrutiny.
Science is under broad attack
today for creating an
unmanageable technology that
swamps human individuality,
fouls the environment and
imperils the survival of the
species. More often than not,
however, science may be blamed
for carrying the bad news that we
know too little rather than too
much to support the growing
numbers of people who
proliferate themselves and their
wastes over the planet.
