To my pacifist friends
To all of you who don't believe in coercion
To you who can make a ten minute speech
on violence to property.
without ever realizing that property
is violence.
To my respected professors,
eminent protectors of windows,
defenders of the legal order,
deeply concerned about
the destruction of a whole people,
in that order.
To you who insist that demands
are really requests and should go through
the proper channels even though
the channels ain't dug yet.
To you who will agree,
academically,
that non-coercive efforts just won't work
but don't approve of coercion.
To you who would have sued Adolph Hitler
for improper behavior
if there had been an appropriate court of law
and if you had been able to overcome the fact
that he was elected democratically.
To you who noticed nothing
when ten million American Indians
were slaughtered at your door step.
To you who were thoroughly convinced
(for two hundred years)
that there was something basically wrong
with slavery.
To you who thought Fidel pretty good
for the Cubans
until he took back
what you had stolen from them.
To you who researched, developed and produced
the most efficient tool
to eradicate the human race,
the human race has ever known to eradicate
and then,
signed petitions against its use.
To you who can be roused
at three o'clock in the morning
to assist in the protection
of your protective,
internal institutions
but could not find one day,
one hour,
one minute
when
a distance little nation of peasants was:
clubbed,
lacerated,
torn,
burnt,
poisoned,
mutilated.
To you who did not say "No"
when your sons were:
taken away,
dressed like soldiers,
trained to kill,
killed.
To you who secretly believe
that the bellies of America can produce
enough children
to fight on a dozen battlefronts
thousands of miles from home
with no disturbance caused to the serenity
of your redwood-slated
ivory towers,
To you who see a big young man
beating on an old weak one and stop
and engage in a rational dialogue
with the former
to ascertain
beyond any reasonable doubht
who started it.
To you who cannot deny
that a duly constituted majority
(of registered American voters)
has the inalienable,
constitutional right
to decide
which man shall live,
which shall not.
To you who are always late
by one strike,
one civil right struggle,
by one war.
I have no words left to speak.

thousands of miles from home
with no disturbance caused to the serenity
of your redwood-slated
ivory towers,
To you who see a big young man
beating on an old weak one and stop
and engage in a rational dialogue
with the former
to ascertain
beyond any reasonable doubht
who started it.
To you who cannot deny
that a duly constituted majority
(of registered American voters)
has the inalienable,
constitutional right
to decide
which man shall live,
which shall not.
To you who are always late
by one strike,
one civil right struggle,
by one war.
I have no words left to speak.

By JACQUES DELACROIX
To my pacifist friends
To all of you who don't believe in coercion
To you who can make a ten minute speech
on violence to property.
without ever realizing that property
is violence.
To my respected professors,
eminent protectors of windows,
defenders of the legal order,
deeply concerned about
the destruction of a whole people,
in that order.
To you who insist that demands
are really requests and should go through
the proper channels even though
the channels ain't dug yet.
To you who will agree,
academically,
that non-coercive efforts just won't work
but don't approve of coercion.
To you who would have sued Adolph Hitler
for improper behavior
if there had been an appropriate court of law
and if you had been able to overcome the fact
that he was elected democratically.
To you who noticed nothing
when ten million American Indians
were slaughtered at your door step.
To you who were thoroughly convinced
(for two hundred years)
that there was something basically wrong
with slavery.
To you who thought Fidel pretty good
for the Cubans
until he took back
what you had stolen from them.
To you who researched, developed and produced
the most efficient tool
to eradicate the human race,
the human race has ever known to eradicate
and then,
signed petitions against its use.
To you who can be roused
at three o'clock in the morning
to assist in the protection
of your protective,
internal institutions
but could not find one day,
one hour,
one minute
when
a distance little nation of peasants was:
clubbed,
lacerated,
torn,
burnt,
poisoned,
mutilated.
To you who did not say "No"
when your sons were:
taken away,
dressed like soldiers,
trained to kill,
killed.
To you who secretly believe
that the bellies of America can produce
enough children
to fight on a dozen battlefronts
thousands of miles from home
with no disturbance caused to the serenity
of your redwood-slated
ivory towers,
To you who see a big young man
beating on an old weak one and stop
and engage in a rational dialogue
with the former
to ascertain
beyond any reasonable doubht
who started it.
To you who cannot deny
that a duly constituted majority
(of registered American voters)
has the inalienable,
constitutional right
to decide
which man shall live,
which shall not.
To you who are always late
by one strike,

by one war.
