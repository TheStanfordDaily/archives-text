## Letter To A Liberal Friend 
### 
Dear Friend:
It is going to be difficult for
me to respond adequately to your
criticism because so much of it is
based on fear and anxiety rather
than political judgment. First of
all let me say that it is silly for
you to on the one hand applaud
my political understanding, moral
values, and human goals while at
the same time condemning my
actions based upon these three
things. The very fact that you
could reach such a conclusion is a
good example of what is wrong
with traditional Western society:
the hierarchical division of mental
and manual labor, of theory and
practice. This must be changed. In
a society of inequality and
domination, anything short of

active opposition to the status
quo is support for that system and
complicity in that decadence.
Verbal expressions of moral
concern are worthless unless they
are carried through into active
struggle against an immoral power
structure.
It particularly means a 100%
commitment to the active
opposition of all forms of direct
repression (warfare), such as the
crushing of insurgent movements
fighting for their freedom. And at
the same time it means
wholeheartedly supporting these
groups in their struggle to do
away with systematic social
violence. It also means in the case
of a person like myself, the
retention of a personal
commitment not to use murder as

Mark Weiss

a tactic in fighting to change a
violent status quo, although not
to condemn others for using this
tactic.
Non-violence has nothing
whatsoever to do with property or
laws. Property is dirt put together
with men's own hands and can
just as easily be taken apart. You
cannot do "violence" to property,
only to human beings. Taking this
further, however, it happens that
the system of private property,
and the destructive way in which
that property is distributed and
used, is doing violence to almost
everyone in this world. If we are
to have a real commitment to
non-violence, then we must be
prepared by any means possible
(taking iiinto some consideration
our personal safety) to halt the
violence.
And if this means smashing
every military arsenal, destroying
every research lab where
destruction is concocted, and
looting e very file where important
plans and records of destruction
are kept, then it must be done.
I'm not sure I'm prepared to do
that, but it's not any "morals"
that are holding me back.
Humanity and history will define
our actions as non-violent; only
the news media and the courts of
law say we are violent—and they
are ownevd and operated by the
very same murderers we are
fighting against, so it is only
natural that they say and do
whatever is necessary in order to
destroy u.s.
Keep Uhe faith.

my political understanding, moral
values, and human goals while at
the same time condemning my
actions based upon these three
things. The very fact that you
could reach such a conclusion is a
good example of what is wrong
with traditional Western society:
the hierarchical division of mental
and manual labor, of theory and
practice. This must be changed. In
a society of inequality and
domination, anything short of

active opposition to the status
quo is support for that system and
complicity in that decadence.
Verbal expressions of moral
concern are worthless unless they
are carried through into active
struggle against an immoral power
structure.
It particularly means a 100%
commitment to the active
opposition of all forms of direct
repression (warfare), such as the
crushing of insurgent movements
fighting for their freedom. And at
the same time it means
wholeheartedly supporting these
groups in their struggle to do
away with systematic social
violence. It also means in the case
of a person like myself, the
retention of a personal
commitment not to use murder as

a tactic in fighting to change a
violent status quo, although not
to condemn others for using this
tactic.
Non-violence has nothing
whatsoever to do with property or
laws. Property is dirt put together
with men's own hands and can
just as easily be taken apart. You
cannot do "violence" to property,
only to human beings. Taking this
further, however, it happens that
the system of private property,
and the destructive way in which
that property is distributed and
used, is doing violence to almost
everyone in this world. If we are
to have a real commitment to
non-violence, then we must be
prepared by any means possible
(taking iiinto some consideration
our personal safety) to halt the
violence.
And if this means smashing
every military arsenal, destroying
every research lab where
destruction is concocted, and
looting e very file where important
plans and records of destruction
are kept, then it must be done.
I'm not sure I'm prepared to do
that, but it's not any "morals"
that are holding me back.
Humanity and history will define
our actions as non-violent; only
the news media and the courts of
law say we are violent—and they
are ownevd and operated by the
very same murderers we are
fighting against, so it is only
natural that they say and do
whatever is necessary in order to
destroy u.s.
Keep Uhe faith.

Dear Friend:
It is going to be difficult for
me to respond adequately to your
criticism because so much of it is
based on fear and anxiety rather
than political judgment. First of
all let me say that it is silly for
you to on the one hand applaud
my political understanding, moral
values, and human goals while at
the same time condemning my
actions based upon these three
things. The very fact that you
could reach such a conclusion is a
good example of what is wrong
