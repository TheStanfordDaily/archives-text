## SDS Pulls The Strings 
### 
According to a leaflet passed
out on White Plaza Friday by the
A3M, the Board of Trustees has
"refused to restrict research" at
SRI. That is not quite true. The
Board on April 8 requested SRI
not to accept any more projects in
the chemical and biological
warfare area until after a study of
the Stanford-SRI relationship.
The leaflet goes on to say that
at their meeting Tuesday, the
Board can at least decide "to
eliminate objectionable research
immediately." Objectionable to
whom? Steve Weissman? Bruce
Franklin? Lincoln "Malik?" Who
has decided in the name of
Stanford students that
"counterinsurgency studies,
Southeast Asia war research,
classified research, and CBW be
stopped? This cannot be done
unilaterally and arbitrarily. It is a
decision which holds the most
critical implications, and it cannot
be made because a small band of
radicals demand it. Any
self-respecting body would
deliberate such a sweeping, crucial
proposition for weeks and
months—who should the Trustees

be expected to make such a
judgment because undisguised
revolutionaries think it in the
interest of "the people of the
Third World?"
In asking for a class boycott on
Monday and Tuesday, the leaflet
added: "This is our last chance to
express our views before the
Trustees make their decision."
The SDS views have been
expressed ad nauseum. Two SDS
members were on the
Stanford-SRI study committee,
and submitted a minority report
as long as the majority report. The
SDS-A3M-Maoist ' viewpoint
dominated the student portion of
the Trustee hearing on April 30.
Five trustees were overwhelmed
by an SDS panel and questioners
in Mem Aud on March 11.
The leaflet is really setting the
stage for the claim on Wednesday
that "they wouldn't listen to us."
(Which translates out to "They
won't do what we want them to
do.") An escalation of the
boycott will then be in order;
"students" from off the campus
have already been invited down
for Wednesday.

Stanford students: how much
longer .-are you going to be duped
by thie Weissmans and the
Franklins and the "Maliks" who
care absolutely nothing about this
institution, this country, this
democracy, your freedom? They
pull the- strings, and you respond.

not to accept any more projects in
the chemical and biological
warfare area until after a study of
the Stanford-SRI relationship.
The leaflet goes on to say that
at their meeting Tuesday, the
Board can at least decide "to
eliminate objectionable research
immediately." Objectionable to
whom? Steve Weissman? Bruce
Franklin? Lincoln "Malik?" Who
has decided in the name of
Stanford students that
"counterinsurgency studies,
Southeast Asia war research,
classified research, and CBW be
stopped? This cannot be done
unilaterally and arbitrarily. It is a
decision which holds the most
critical implications, and it cannot
be made because a small band of
radicals demand it. Any
self-respecting body would
deliberate such a sweeping, crucial
proposition for weeks and
months—who should the Trustees

be expected to make such a
judgment because undisguised
revolutionaries think it in the
interest of "the people of the
Third World?"
In asking for a class boycott on
Monday and Tuesday, the leaflet
added: "This is our last chance to
express our views before the
Trustees make their decision."
The SDS views have been
expressed ad nauseum. Two SDS
members were on the
Stanford-SRI study committee,
and submitted a minority report
as long as the majority report. The
SDS-A3M-Maoist ' viewpoint
dominated the student portion of
the Trustee hearing on April 30.
Five trustees were overwhelmed
by an SDS panel and questioners
in Mem Aud on March 11.
The leaflet is really setting the
stage for the claim on Wednesday
that "they wouldn't listen to us."
(Which translates out to "They
won't do what we want them to
do.") An escalation of the
boycott will then be in order;
"students" from off the campus
have already been invited down
for Wednesday.

Stanford students: how much
longer .-are you going to be duped
by thie Weissmans and the
Franklins and the "Maliks" who
care absolutely nothing about this
institution, this country, this
democracy, your freedom? They
pull the- strings, and you respond.
