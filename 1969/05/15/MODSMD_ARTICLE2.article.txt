# SJC Announcement
## Fall Hearings Possible 
### 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
announced yesterday that it could not
guarantee hearings this quarter to those
students under temporary suspension
after the occupation of Encina Hall
unless they had already requested such a
hearing.
Council Chairman Jack Friedenthal,
professor of law, declared that the SJC
would make a "good faith effort to hear
every case," but that a hearing could
not be guaranteed for those who had
not signed up by the deadline the
Council set of 5 p.m. yesterday.
The defense council for the
suspended students voiced strong
objection to this Council
announcement. The defense claimed
that two pretrial motions are being
prepared, the outcome of which will
determine the defendants' course of
action.
To set the date for hearings before

rulings on the motions, the defense
claimed, would unduly jeopardize
defendants who might change their
stated course of action following such
rulings.
Such defendants would then be
guilty of noncooperation with the
Judicial Council.
The motions challenge the temporary
suspensions and the SJC's refusal to
allow a joint trial (see statement below).
The announcement followed nearly
four hours of intense discussion
between the Council and the defendants
over a request for continuance of
yesterday's preliminary conference to
discuss the format for the future
hearings.
The defendants claimed that they
were not adequately prepared to decide
what kind of hearings they wanted or
the dates of such hearings.

with at least one continuance, Steve
Heiser, Chairman of the Movement's
Defense Council, stated: "We don't feel
we have to ask for a continuance; we
feel we have a right."
Friedenthal replied, "This is not a
court and we operate differently."
Following separate meetings of the
SJC and the defendants the Council
granted a five hour continuance.
Questioned about the short time
allowed, the Council explained that
unless hearings were arranged that day
there was a possibility that all the cases
could not be heard this quarter.
"Because of your time limitations 1
get screwed?" one defendant asked.
"Yes. You put it in very succinct
terms," Friedenthal replied.
Friedenthal then explained the
proposed format for the hearings. The
Council had decided that there would
be a joint hearing Monday to decide
whether the Encina occupation was in
violation of the Campus Disruption
Policy. The joint hearing would be
followed by individual hearings on
individual involvement (see SJC
statement below).
The question of a mass trial for the
defendants was also debated yesterday.
Friedenthal expressed concern that
"there is a tremendous amount of
pressure on individuals "to follow a
group decision."
One of the Movement's
representatives said, "When you send
someone in as an individual, it is
coercion in the opposite direction."
A member of the SJC stressed that
they had an obligation to handle the
cases "in a manner responsible to the

Following separate meetings of the
SJC and the defendants the Council
granted a five hour continuance.
Questioned about the short time
allowed, the Council explained that
unless hearings were arranged that day
there was a possibility that all the cases
could not be heard this quarter.
"Because of your time limitations 1
get screwed?" one defendant asked.
"Yes. You put it in very succinct
terms," Friedenthal replied.
Friedenthal then explained the
proposed format for the hearings. The
Council had decided that there would
be a joint hearing Monday to decide
whether the Encina occupation was in
violation of the Campus Disruption
Policy. The joint hearing would be
followed by individual hearings on
individual involvement (see SJC
statement below).
The question of a mass trial for the
defendants was also debated yesterday.
Friedenthal expressed concern that
"there is a tremendous amount of
pressure on individuals "to follow a
group decision."
One of the Movement's
representatives said, "When you send
someone in as an individual, it is
coercion in the opposite direction."
A member of the SJC stressed that
they had an obligation to handle the
cases "in a manner responsible to the
University and fair to the individual "
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
announced yesterday that it could not
guarantee hearings this quarter to those
students under temporary suspension
after the occupation of Encina Hall
unless they had already requested such a
hearing.
Council Chairman Jack Friedenthal,
professor of law, declared that the SJC
would make a "good faith effort to hear
every case," but that a hearing could
not be guaranteed for those who had
not signed up by the deadline the
Council set of 5 p.m. yesterday.
The defense council for the
suspended students voiced strong
objection to this Council
announcement. The defense claimed
that two pretrial motions are being
prepared, the outcome of which will
determine the defendants' course of
action.
To set the date for hearings before

rulings on the motions, the defense
claimed, would unduly jeopardize
defendants who might change their
stated course of action following such
rulings.
Such defendants would then be
guilty of noncooperation with the
Judicial Council.
The motions challenge the temporary
suspensions and the SJC's refusal to
allow a joint trial (see statement below).
The announcement followed nearly
four hours of intense discussion
between the Council and the defendants
over a request for continuance of
yesterday's preliminary conference to
discuss the format for the future
hearings.
The defendants claimed that they
were not adequately prepared to decide
what kind of hearings they wanted or
the dates of such hearings.
