# Jew Of Malta: Triumph And Trivia
## 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Edgar Reynolds' production of

The use of puppets, highly

Socila or Physhological

seems to me, which rescues the

surprise. Denis Whitaker as
Ferneze, Governor of Malta, lends
an element of three-dimensional
ity to this cartoonesque menagerie
of characters.
But the really outstanding
performances are in some of the
smaller roles. Many of these are
superbly done, but a few deserve
special mention. John Davis as
Martin Del Bosco, Vice-Admiral
of Spain, is decidedly one of the
high points of the show; he has
taken a mediocre part and
transformed it into a beautiful
comic role.
The same is true of Gail
Hoffman as Abigail, Barabas'
daughter, and Robbie Levittow as
the courtesan Bellamira, both of
whom do splendidly with their
characters.
The acting and the humor in
the show make it worth seeing as
entertainment, even if it is not
highly significant. When, at the
end, Barabas has just been
dropped into boiling oil, and the
Turk Calymath (Gene Engene)
asks, "Tell me, you Christians,
what doth this portend?" we may
not get an answer, but we get the
full impact of the comedy; and
that is, after all, something.
