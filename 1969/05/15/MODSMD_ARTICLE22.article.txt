# Foreign Students: No Open Doors
## 
### PAUL ROLLES 
"It was probably one of the
most regretable experiences of my
life," replied one of Stanford's
1000 foreign graduate students
when asked about his initial
search for housing here at
Stanford.
Every quarter of every year,
the foreign graduate student faces
the same problem of finding
adequate housing. Many times
several entire weeks are spent in
looking for a place to live.
According to Spyros
Covoundis, Foreign Vice President
of the International Center, "The
foreign graduate student is
handicapped by a lack of
transportation, orientation
programs thai don't work, and the
strangeness of a new land" in his
search for housing.
Part of the foreign student's
housing problem can be attributed
to the many University
Residences that are presently
without any foreign graduate
students. In the future, it is hoped
that each residence will house at
least two foreign graduate
students.
On the housing referendum of
April 15 and 16 students voted in
strong support of the resolution
which stated that "at least one
foreign graduate student be
invited to live in each campus
living group." The resolution was
prefaced with the comment that

"it is unfortunate that the
community interacts so little with
the foreign student partly because
so many have to live off campus."
"It's time for the University to
take responsibility for providing
housing for its foreign students,"
stated Joyce Kobayashi, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
"The ASSU office and the
International Center are currently
working for the possibility of an
international house at Wilbur
similar to Adelpha," Joyce said.
Theta Xi is presently working
on a program with the ASSU to
help alleviate the housing problem
for foreign graduate students by
providing rooms in their
fraternity. It is hoped that other
fraternities with available space
will follow suit.
Other possible solutions
suggested by foreign students
include (1) the University leasing
off campus housing which in turn
can be rented to foreign students,
and (2) making available more
spaces in dormitories.
The solution that is eventually
undertaken will be determined
from the results of a two page
housing questionnaire sent to all
foreign students. Action on the
questionnaire is not expected
until next fall.
All foreign graduate students
agree, however, that the housing
crisis must be solved.

of the ASSU Council of
Presidents.
"The ASSU office and the
International Center are currently
working for the possibility of an
international house at Wilbur
similar to Adelpha," Joyce said.
Theta Xi is presently working
on a program with the ASSU to
help alleviate the housing problem
for foreign graduate students by
providing rooms in their
fraternity. It is hoped that other
fraternities with available space
will follow suit.
Other possible solutions
suggested by foreign students
include (1) the University leasing
off campus housing which in turn
can be rented to foreign students,
and (2) making available more
spaces in dormitories.
The solution that is eventually
undertaken will be determined
from the results of a two page
housing questionnaire sent to all
foreign students. Action on the
questionnaire is not expected
until next fall.
All foreign graduate students
agree, however, that the housing
crisis must be solved.
