# Spring Sports Conclude
## 
### FRED MANN 
Spring sports draw to a close
this week on four fronts, with the
Pacific-8 championships spread
out all along the coast.
Tennis, track, golf, and crew all
wind up their seasons with title
affairs being held from Seattle
down to San Diego's Mission Bay.
After Saturday, only baseball will
continue, and even that sport will
be over if Stanford does not make
it to the District Playoffs.
The Pac-8 tennis
championships will be held here at
The Farm starting today and
running through Saturday. Unlike
the NCAA finals at Princeton, this
competition will be held as several
dual matches all at once in a
round robin tournament.
The track finals are up in
Corvallis, Oregon all day Friday
and Saturday. Basically the meet
figures to be a real battle with
always champion USC facing a
very strong host OSU team.
Oregon and UCLA must also be
counted on as longshots.
Stanford will not pose much of

a threat. Field events will favor
UCLA while USC and the Bruins
will be powers in the relays.
Oregon and OSU are expected to
be the winners in the distance
races. The Beavers and Trojans
will battle it out in the sprints,
and the hurdles are up for grabs.
Last year USC ran up 128
points to 82 for Oregon, and 79
to OSU. Stanford ran last with
only 18, but should show better
this year.
Perhaps Stanford's best shot at
a conference title is on the golf
course. Coach Bud Finger's
defending champs will battle last
year's runner-up USC in the
two-day competition starting
Friday. The tournament will be
held on the rugged Seattle Rainer
Golf and Country Club, hosted by
the University of Washington.
The course is a par-72 layout,
and one of the toughest in the
Pac-8. Stanford's own difficult
course should prepare the Indians
well. Last year in Los Angeles the
Tribe squeezed out an eight point
win over SC, but in the U.S.

Intercollegiates held here two
weeks ago, the Trojans gained
revenge by nipping the hosts for
the title.
Stanford stars Tom Watson,
Greg Pitzer, and Sandy Adelman
will carry the bulk of the Card
burden. Southern Cal is lead by
Gary Sanders, U.S. Intercollegiate
tourney medalist, and Greg
McHatton.
Seven Pac-8 crews are entered
in the Western Intercollegiate
Rowing Championships on Friday
and Saturday. More than 20
collegiate shells will be going in
the two-day regatta, with
defending champion Washington
the strong favorite.
The unbeaten Huskies are
favored in all categoriesâ€”varsity,
JV, and freshman. The strongest
challengers figure to be Stanford
and UCLA. The Bruins are also
undefeated, and this meeting will
be the first between Washington
and UCLA this year. The Indians
have dropped only two meets this
year . . .one to the Huskies, and
the other to the Bruins.

Last year Stanford tied with
UCLA for second behind U. of VV.
in the Western Rowing
Championships in Seattle. Other
Pac-8 shells entered this year are
California, USC, Oregon State,
and Oregon. The competition will
be held in San Diego.


FANCY PANTS-When you are one of
the top collegiate golfers on the West
Coast, you can wear whatever you
want. The Tribe's Greg Pitzer will be
one of the keys in the Pac-8
championships this weekend.
