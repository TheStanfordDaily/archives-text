The Pacific-8 baseball race goes
down to the wire this weekend
with UCLA leading the pack by a
game—maybe. The issue is in
doubt because Stanford is
protesting Tuesday's 4-3 loss to
Oregon at Eugene.
The loss may do down in the
records books as a 9-0 win for the
Tribe if the protest, lodged by
coach Ray Young, is upheld.
Young protested the game
Tuesday afternoon when the
starting time was delayed 20

minutes. There was no apparent
reason for the delay, and neither
the umpires nor the Stanford
team were notified that there
would be one. The Pac-8 rule
book states that if a team "fails to
appear on the field within 5
minutes of starting time, a forfeit
shall be declared by the umpire in
favor of the team not at fault."
Ostensibly, thus, the Indians
should be awarded the contest.
But Pacific-8 Director Tom
Hamilton is withholding a
decision until a meeting tonight of
Pac-8 athletic directors in
Corvallis when he will have access
to the views of both teams as well
as the umpires.
Regardless of whether the
protest goes through, the
possibility of a two-way or
three-way tie for the league crown
still exists. Should Stanford, USC
and UCLA end in a three-way
deadlock, a coin flip would
determine which team draws a
bye in the playoffs. The winner of

the first game would then play at
home against the third team.
Should Stanford tie with
UCLA or USC, the two teams
would play off for the title,
according to Pac-8 publicist Bob
Springer. This contradicts an
agreement reportedly reached by
league baseball coaches last year
which would award the title to
the winner of the season series.
The Tribe won this year's series
with USC but lot two of three to
UCLA.
So the race is still wide open.
As Young said yesterday, "Any
way you look at it, we're still in
it." Tomorrow's game against Cal
here starts at 3:00 p.m.
