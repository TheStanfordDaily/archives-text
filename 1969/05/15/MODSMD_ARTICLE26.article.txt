## Pro Soccer At Stanford 
### 
International soccer will come
to Stanford on Sunday May 25
when four top professional soccer
teams will be vying for the
California International Cup in a
tournament organized to celebrate
the Palo Alto Diamond Jubilee.
On Sunday at 2:00 p.m. Dukla
Prague will meet West Bromwich
Albion of England. The next
Sunday all four teams will play in
a double header in Stanford
Stadium with West Bromwich
opposing Setubal of Portugal at
1:00 p.m. and the California
Clippers taking on Dukla at 3:00
p.m.
Dukla Prague, Czechoslovakia's
most successful team, has
captured the Czech soccer
championship 8 times and the
Czech Cup 3 times. A veteran
team in European Cup
competition games, the talented
Czechs reached the semi-finals in

1967. Dukla also won the
International Soccer League
Tournament in New York four
times in a row from 1961 to
1964.
West Bromwich Albion,
winners of the English Football
Association Cup in 1969 and
semi-finalists this year, is a team
that comes through with a win
when the chips are down. Led by
high-scoring center forward Jeff
Astle and inside right Daniel
Hegan, recently acquired for a
transfer fee of $225,000, the
"Throstles" will rely on a
fast-moving attack against the
classical, elegant but more
deliberate style of Dukla.
"I am delighted that these
games will be played in Stanford
Stadium," stated Derek Liecty,
Stanford '54, former captain of
the Stanford soccer varsity, and
currently vice-president of the

California Clippers. "Ever since I
left Stanford I've dreamed of a
setting like this for a soccer
tournament and I am sure it will
be a great success."
