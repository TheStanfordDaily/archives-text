# SJC Statement

(Ed. Note: The Student Judicial Council
released the following statement yesterday.)
The following procedures for a
hearing relating to the incident involving
the occupation of Encina Hall on May 1
have been established: A hearing is
scheduled for Monday morning, May
19, 1969, at 8 o'clock a.m. in the Moot
Court Room of the Stanford Law
School.
The purpose of this hearing is solely
for the purpose of determining whether
or not a disruption occurred in the early
morning hours of May 1 at Encina Hall.
If a disruption is found, then
subsequent to the joint hearing,
individual hearings on the question of
participation in specific acts and
motivation of the individual will be held
for those defendants who have
scheduled a hearing with the Stanford
Judicial Council.
This procedure has been established
in order to assure removal of as many
defendants' temporary suspensions as
possible before the end of this quarter.
For all those accused who requested
hearings before 5 p.m. Wednesday, May
14th, the Stanford Judicial Council has
already recommended to the President
the removal of their temporary
suspensions and has guaranteed to hold
hearings on their cases this quarter.
Furthermore, the Council assures all
other accused individuals who request a
hearing that it will make every effort to
hold hearings this quarter; however, the
SJC cannot guarantee that it will have
time to prepare cases and hold hearings
for those who request hearings
subsequent to the 5 p.m. May 14th
deadline.
Individuals were requested to appear

on May 14th before a committee of the
Council to set dates and times for
hearings in their cases. At this
preliminary conference there was
considerable confusion concerning the
SJC procedures to be followed and
several motions were presented for
Council consideration. The members of
the Council present waited until the full
Council assembled in order to act
officially as a Council on the two
motions presented.
1. It was moved that the Council
grant a continuance of the preliminary
conference until such time as the
defendants could prepare their
responses to the Council's summons.
The Council held that the conference
should be continued only until 5 p.m.
May 14th and that failure to participate
in the conference would not of itself be
cause for any sanction |)y the SJC. In
making this decision the Council noted
that for those who did not participate in
the preliminary conference the
temporary suspensions will be
continued. The conference was
continued only to 5 p.m. because of the
great difficulty and significant time
needed to prepare for a trial in such a
complex case.
2. It was moved that all hearings on
all matters concerning the Encina
incident be joint open hearings. The
Council denied the motion as phrased
on the grounds that joint hearings are
inappropriate except concerning the
question of disruption and held that the
Council has the responsibility, both to
the individuals charged and to the
community, to make individual
distinctions as to specific acts and
motivation in findings both of guilt or
innocence and assignment of penalty.

(Fd. Note: The following is a
statement of the Legal Defense
Committee of the April 3rd Movement.)
On Monday of this week, many of
the members of the April 3 Movement
received summonses to "conferences"
with the SJC to arrange and set the
"type, scope, and nature" of hearings
concerning their alleged participation in
incidents said to have taken place in or
around the Huey P. Newton Institute
for the Study of Racism, Imperialism,
and Capitalism (formerly known as
Encina Hall) on or about May 1, 1969.
These conferences were all to take
place the following Wednesday—in most
cases within thirty-six hours of the
serving of notice, and in at least three
cases within twelve hours.
The Legal Defense Committee
frantically arranged a meeting of all
suspended students we knew of—the
Administration and the SJC consistently
refused to release the complete list of
the suspended students until noon on
Wednesday.
At this Tuesday meeting, the Legal
Defense Committee presented a motion
to be made to the SJC requesting a
continuance of all SJC proceedings,
including the conferences, for a
reasonable period of time; this motion
was signed by all fifty-two people
present of sixty-five people who had
been suspended and had not yet
requested or had hearings, we were able
to contact only these fifty-two.
We submitted the signed motion to
the SJC Chairman at approximately
5:10 p.m.
The basis of the motion for a
continuance was two-fold: first,
thirty-six hours (or less) is not enough
time for defendants, who by the terms
of their suspensions are precluded from
entering administrative and other
buildings to gather evidence and in
other ways prepare their defense, to
make the kind of decisions we thought
we might be required to make by the
SJC.
Second, one continuance for a
reasonable period of lime is a basic
element of due process, and also a
statutory guarantee of the Code of Civil
Procedure of the State of California.
The group voted to appear en masse
at the conference room at 8:00 a.m. on
Wednesday morning, which was the
time set for the first conference. Upon
our arrival, we found thai our worst
fears about what to expect had been 100
naive: the SJC, or at least its Chairman,
