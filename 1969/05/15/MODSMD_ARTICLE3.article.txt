# SJC Statement

### 
(Ed. Note: The Student Judicial Council
released the following statement yesterday.)
The following procedures for a
hearing relating to the incident involving
the occupation of Encina Hall on May 1
have been established: A hearing is
scheduled for Monday morning, May
19, 1969, at 8 o'clock a.m. in the Moot
Court Room of the Stanford Law
School.
The purpose of this hearing is solely
for the purpose of determining whether
or not a disruption occurred in the early
morning hours of May 1 at Encina Hall.
If a disruption is found, then
subsequent to the joint hearing,
individual hearings on the question of
participation in specific acts and
motivation of the individual will be held
for those defendants who have
scheduled a hearing with the Stanford
Judicial Council.
This procedure has been established
in order to assure removal of as many
defendants' temporary suspensions as
possible before the end of this quarter.
For all those accused who requested
hearings before 5 p.m. Wednesday, May
14th, the Stanford Judicial Council has
already recommended to the President
the removal of their temporary
suspensions and has guaranteed to hold
hearings on their cases this quarter.
Furthermore, the Council assures all
other accused individuals who request a
hearing that it will make every effort to
hold hearings this quarter; however, the
SJC cannot guarantee that it will have
time to prepare cases and hold hearings
for those who request hearings
subsequent to the 5 p.m. May 14th
deadline.
Individuals were requested to appear

on May 14th before a committee of the
Council to set dates and times for
hearings in their cases. At this
preliminary conference there was
considerable confusion concerning the
SJC procedures to be followed and
several motions were presented for
Council consideration. The members of
the Council present waited until the full
Council assembled in order to act
officially as a Council on the two
motions presented.
1. It was moved that the Council
grant a continuance of the preliminary
conference until such time as the
defendants could prepare their
responses to the Council's summons.
The Council held that the conference
should be continued only until 5 p.m.
May 14th and that failure to participate
in the conference would not of itself be
cause for any sanction |)y the SJC. In
making this decision the Council noted
that for those who did not participate in
the preliminary conference the
temporary suspensions will be
continued. The conference was
continued only to 5 p.m. because of the
great difficulty and significant time
needed to prepare for a trial in such a
complex case.
2. It was moved that all hearings on
all matters concerning the Encina
incident be joint open hearings. The
Council denied the motion as phrased
on the grounds that joint hearings are
inappropriate except concerning the
question of disruption and held that the
Council has the responsibility, both to
the individuals charged and to the
community, to make individual
distinctions as to specific acts and
motivation in findings both of guilt or
innocence and assignment of penalty.

(Fd. Note: The following is a
statement of the Legal Defense
Committee of the April 3rd Movement.)
On Monday of this week, many of
the members of the April 3 Movement
received summonses to "conferences"
with the SJC to arrange and set the
"type, scope, and nature" of hearings
concerning their alleged participation in
incidents said to have taken place in or
around the Huey P. Newton Institute
for the Study of Racism, Imperialism,
and Capitalism (formerly known as
Encina Hall) on or about May 1, 1969.
These conferences were all to take
place the following Wednesday—in most
cases within thirty-six hours of the
serving of notice, and in at least three
cases within twelve hours.
The Legal Defense Committee
frantically arranged a meeting of all
suspended students we knew of—the
Administration and the SJC consistently
refused to release the complete list of
the suspended students until noon on
Wednesday.
At this Tuesday meeting, the Legal
Defense Committee presented a motion
to be made to the SJC requesting a
continuance of all SJC proceedings,
including the conferences, for a
reasonable period of time; this motion
was signed by all fifty-two people
present of sixty-five people who had
been suspended and had not yet
requested or had hearings, we were able
to contact only these fifty-two.
We submitted the signed motion to
the SJC Chairman at approximately
5:10 p.m.
The basis of the motion for a
continuance was two-fold: first,
thirty-six hours (or less) is not enough
time for defendants, who by the terms
of their suspensions are precluded from
entering administrative and other
buildings to gather evidence and in
other ways prepare their defense, to
make the kind of decisions we thought
we might be required to make by the
SJC.
Second, one continuance for a
reasonable period of lime is a basic
element of due process, and also a
statutory guarantee of the Code of Civil
Procedure of the State of California.
The group voted to appear en masse
at the conference room at 8:00 a.m. on
Wednesday morning, which was the
time set for the first conference. Upon
our arrival, we found thai our worst
fears about what to expect had been 100
naive: the SJC, or at least its Chairman,

The group voted to appear en masse
at the conference room at 8:00 a.m. on
Wednesday morning, which was the
time set for the first conference. Upon
our arrival, we found thai our worst
fears about what to expect had been 100
naive: the SJC, or at least its Chairman,
had prepared a form to be signed
by the accused which can only be
described as vicious.
For one thing, it stated in no
uncertain terms that the
individuals must choose on the
spot either to plead guilty, or to
deny that the incidents of May 1
constituted a disruption and/or
that they were involved—no
provision was made for informing
the accused that they could defer
pleading at that time, or that they
could at least examine the
evidence against them before
pleading.
Secondly, the form contained a
clause which required the accused
to waive their right—guaranteed to
them by both the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, the
SJC's own rules of procedure—to
call witnesses to testify orally in
their behalf (defendants were
advised that they could request
that the SJC allow them to call
such witnesses, but the difference
between being allowed to call
witnesses if the Chairman happens
to agree is far different from a
right to do so if and to the extent
that the defendant involved
wants).
Whether or not the Chairman
was solely responsible for
instigating these inexcusable
violations of fundamental
rights—and there is ample
evidence that he was—he was
without any doubt whatsoever
responsible for their reaching the
defendants as they did. He must
resign immediatley, and must in
no case be allowed to preside over
any further proceedings of the
SJC.
Although conferences had been
scheduled for the hours of 8:00 to
12:00, that entire period was
taken up by negotiations between
the SJC and the defendants. The
SJC held firm in its denial of our

motion for a joint trial, at which
all of the accused would be tried
at the same time.
It also denied the motion for a
continuance of the proceedings,
and simply informed us that only
those students who asked for
individual hearings before 5:00
p.m. yesterday would be assured
of a hearing before the end of the
spring term—and only those
students who have their hearings
scheduled for this term would
have their suspensions lifted.
The Legal Defense Committee
strenuously objected to the 5:00
p.m. deadline. In addition to the
reasons cited above, we made two
crucial and, we feel, reasonable
points. First, we intend to move
that the SJC declare the
temporary suspensions void, in
that they were made pursuant to
an emergency order of the
President (the Daily, April 18)
that is patently illegal.
In the event that this motion is
successful, many of the accused
may want to exercise their
prerogative to defer hearing of
their case until fall quarter, 1969.
If, however, they are forced to
register for individual hearings
before a decision on the
temporary suspensions is reached,
they are precluded from
exercising this prerogative, for if
they fail to appear for their
scheduled hearing they are guilty
of non-cooperation with the SJC,
and subject to further sanctions.
Second, the same argument
was made concerning a written
motion we will file on Thursday
morning for a joint trial. In spite
of being denied this morning, we
feel that we have a strong case for
being tried as a group, in that we
acted as a group and have made
known from the very beginning of
the April 3 Movement that we
desired to be dealt with as a
group.

Again, if this motion is

Movement's hard-core radical
leaders are coercing the less visible
members of the accused into
foolishly going along with the
group against their own interests,
but he knows he is wrong, and
more importantly, the other
members of the Council are now
beginning to realize that he is
wrong.
In addition, the demand for
amnesty approved unanimously at
the mass meeting of the
Movement yesterday will
strengthen this resolve of the
accused immensely.
We are together, we are right,
and we are going to win. We have
finished jumping, Jack.

the suspended students until noon on
Wednesday.
At this Tuesday meeting, the Legal
Defense Committee presented a motion
to be made to the SJC requesting a
continuance of all SJC proceedings,
including the conferences, for a
reasonable period of time; this motion
was signed by all fifty-two people
present of sixty-five people who had
been suspended and had not yet
requested or had hearings, we were able
to contact only these fifty-two.
We submitted the signed motion to
the SJC Chairman at approximately
5:10 p.m.
The basis of the motion for a
continuance was two-fold: first,
thirty-six hours (or less) is not enough
time for defendants, who by the terms
of their suspensions are precluded from
entering administrative and other
buildings to gather evidence and in
other ways prepare their defense, to
make the kind of decisions we thought
we might be required to make by the
SJC.
Second, one continuance for a
reasonable period of lime is a basic
element of due process, and also a
statutory guarantee of the Code of Civil
Procedure of the State of California.
The group voted to appear en masse
at the conference room at 8:00 a.m. on
Wednesday morning, which was the
time set for the first conference. Upon
our arrival, we found thai our worst
fears about what to expect had been 100
naive: the SJC, or at least its Chairman,
had prepared a form to be signed
by the accused which can only be
described as vicious.
For one thing, it stated in no
uncertain terms that the
individuals must choose on the
spot either to plead guilty, or to
deny that the incidents of May 1
constituted a disruption and/or
that they were involved—no
provision was made for informing
the accused that they could defer
pleading at that time, or that they
could at least examine the
evidence against them before
pleading.
Secondly, the form contained a
clause which required the accused
to waive their right—guaranteed to
them by both the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, the
SJC's own rules of procedure—to
call witnesses to testify orally in
their behalf (defendants were
advised that they could request
that the SJC allow them to call
such witnesses, but the difference
between being allowed to call
witnesses if the Chairman happens
to agree is far different from a
right to do so if and to the extent
that the defendant involved
wants).
Whether or not the Chairman
was solely responsible for
instigating these inexcusable
violations of fundamental
rights—and there is ample
evidence that he was—he was
without any doubt whatsoever
responsible for their reaching the
defendants as they did. He must
resign immediatley, and must in
no case be allowed to preside over
any further proceedings of the
SJC.
Although conferences had been
scheduled for the hours of 8:00 to
12:00, that entire period was
taken up by negotiations between
the SJC and the defendants. The
SJC held firm in its denial of our

motion for a joint trial, at which
all of the accused would be tried
at the same time.
It also denied the motion for a
continuance of the proceedings,
and simply informed us that only
those students who asked for
individual hearings before 5:00
p.m. yesterday would be assured
of a hearing before the end of the
spring term—and only those
students who have their hearings
scheduled for this term would
have their suspensions lifted.
The Legal Defense Committee
strenuously objected to the 5:00
p.m. deadline. In addition to the
reasons cited above, we made two
crucial and, we feel, reasonable
points. First, we intend to move
that the SJC declare the
temporary suspensions void, in
that they were made pursuant to
an emergency order of the
President (the Daily, April 18)
that is patently illegal.
In the event that this motion is
successful, many of the accused
may want to exercise their
prerogative to defer hearing of
their case until fall quarter, 1969.
If, however, they are forced to
register for individual hearings
before a decision on the
temporary suspensions is reached,
they are precluded from
exercising this prerogative, for if
they fail to appear for their
scheduled hearing they are guilty
of non-cooperation with the SJC,
and subject to further sanctions.
Second, the same argument
was made concerning a written
motion we will file on Thursday
morning for a joint trial. In spite
of being denied this morning, we
feel that we have a strong case for
being tried as a group, in that we
acted as a group and have made
known from the very beginning of
the April 3 Movement that we
desired to be dealt with as a
group.

Again, if this motion is

Movement's hard-core radical
leaders are coercing the less visible
members of the accused into
foolishly going along with the
group against their own interests,
but he knows he is wrong, and
more importantly, the other
members of the Council are now
beginning to realize that he is
wrong.
In addition, the demand for
amnesty approved unanimously at
the mass meeting of the
Movement yesterday will
strengthen this resolve of the
accused immensely.
We are together, we are right,
and we are going to win. We have
finished jumping, Jack.
(Ed. Note: The Student Judicial Council
released the following statement yesterday.)
The following procedures for a
hearing relating to the incident involving
the occupation of Encina Hall on May 1
have been established: A hearing is
scheduled for Monday morning, May
19, 1969, at 8 o'clock a.m. in the Moot
Court Room of the Stanford Law
School.
The purpose of this hearing is solely
for the purpose of determining whether
or not a disruption occurred in the early
morning hours of May 1 at Encina Hall.
If a disruption is found, then
subsequent to the joint hearing,
individual hearings on the question of
participation in specific acts and
motivation of the individual will be held
for those defendants who have
scheduled a hearing with the Stanford
Judicial Council.
This procedure has been established
in order to assure removal of as many
defendants' temporary suspensions as
possible before the end of this quarter.
For all those accused who requested
hearings before 5 p.m. Wednesday, May
14th, the Stanford Judicial Council has
already recommended to the President
the removal of their temporary
suspensions and has guaranteed to hold
hearings on their cases this quarter.
Furthermore, the Council assures all
other accused individuals who request a
hearing that it will make every effort to
hold hearings this quarter; however, the
SJC cannot guarantee that it will have
time to prepare cases and hold hearings
for those who request hearings
subsequent to the 5 p.m. May 14th
deadline.
Individuals were requested to appear

on May 14th before a committee of the
Council to set dates and times for
hearings in their cases. At this
preliminary conference there was
considerable confusion concerning the
SJC procedures to be followed and
several motions were presented for
Council consideration. The members of
the Council present waited until the full
Council assembled in order to act
officially as a Council on the two
motions presented.
1. It was moved that the Council
grant a continuance of the preliminary
conference until such time as the
defendants could prepare their
responses to the Council's summons.
The Council held that the conference
should be continued only until 5 p.m.
May 14th and that failure to participate
in the conference would not of itself be
cause for any sanction |)y the SJC. In
making this decision the Council noted
that for those who did not participate in
the preliminary conference the
temporary suspensions will be
continued. The conference was
continued only to 5 p.m. because of the
great difficulty and significant time
needed to prepare for a trial in such a
complex case.
2. It was moved that all hearings on
all matters concerning the Encina
incident be joint open hearings. The
Council denied the motion as phrased
on the grounds that joint hearings are
inappropriate except concerning the
question of disruption and held that the
Council has the responsibility, both to
the individuals charged and to the
community, to make individual
distinctions as to specific acts and
motivation in findings both of guilt or
innocence and assignment of penalty.

(Fd. Note: The following is a
statement of the Legal Defense
Committee of the April 3rd Movement.)
On Monday of this week, many of
the members of the April 3 Movement
received summonses to "conferences"
with the SJC to arrange and set the
"type, scope, and nature" of hearings
concerning their alleged participation in
incidents said to have taken place in or
around the Huey P. Newton Institute
for the Study of Racism, Imperialism,
and Capitalism (formerly known as
Encina Hall) on or about May 1, 1969.
These conferences were all to take
place the following Wednesday—in most
cases within thirty-six hours of the
serving of notice, and in at least three
cases within twelve hours.
The Legal Defense Committee
frantically arranged a meeting of all
suspended students we knew of—the

that is patently illegal.
In the event that this motion is
successful, many of the accused
may want to exercise their
prerogative to defer hearing of
their case until fall quarter, 1969.
If, however, they are forced to
register for individual hearings
before a decision on the
temporary suspensions is reached,
they are precluded from
exercising this prerogative, for if
they fail to appear for their
scheduled hearing they are guilty
of non-cooperation with the SJC,
and subject to further sanctions.
Second, the same argument
was made concerning a written
motion we will file on Thursday
morning for a joint trial. In spite
of being denied this morning, we
feel that we have a strong case for
being tried as a group, in that we
acted as a group and have made
known from the very beginning of
the April 3 Movement that we
desired to be dealt with as a
group.

Again, if this motion is

Movement's hard-core radical
leaders are coercing the less visible
members of the accused into
foolishly going along with the
group against their own interests,
but he knows he is wrong, and
more importantly, the other
members of the Council are now
beginning to realize that he is
wrong.
In addition, the demand for
amnesty approved unanimously at
the mass meeting of the
Movement yesterday will
strengthen this resolve of the
accused immensely.
We are together, we are right,
and we are going to win. We have
finished jumping, Jack.
(Ed. Note: The Student Judicial Council
released the following statement yesterday.)
The following procedures for a
hearing relating to the incident involving
the occupation of Encina Hall on May 1
have been established: A hearing is
scheduled for Monday morning, May
19, 1969, at 8 o'clock a.m. in the Moot
Court Room of the Stanford Law
School.
The purpose of this hearing is solely
for the purpose of determining whether
or not a disruption occurred in the early
morning hours of May 1 at Encina Hall.
If a disruption is found, then
subsequent to the joint hearing,
individual hearings on the question of
participation in specific acts and
motivation of the individual will be held
for those defendants who have
scheduled a hearing with the Stanford
Judicial Council.
This procedure has been established
in order to assure removal of as many
defendants' temporary suspensions as
possible before the end of this quarter.
For all those accused who requested
hearings before 5 p.m. Wednesday, May
14th, the Stanford Judicial Council has
already recommended to the President
the removal of their temporary
suspensions and has guaranteed to hold
hearings on their cases this quarter.
Furthermore, the Council assures all
other accused individuals who request a
hearing that it will make every effort to
hold hearings this quarter; however, the
SJC cannot guarantee that it will have
time to prepare cases and hold hearings
for those who request hearings
subsequent to the 5 p.m. May 14th
deadline.
Individuals were requested to appear

on May 14th before a committee of the
Council to set dates and times for
hearings in their cases. At this
preliminary conference there was
considerable confusion concerning the
SJC procedures to be followed and
several motions were presented for
Council consideration. The members of
the Council present waited until the full
Council assembled in order to act
officially as a Council on the two
motions presented.
1. It was moved that the Council
grant a continuance of the preliminary
conference until such time as the
defendants could prepare their
responses to the Council's summons.
The Council held that the conference
should be continued only until 5 p.m.
May 14th and that failure to participate
in the conference would not of itself be
cause for any sanction |)y the SJC. In
making this decision the Council noted
that for those who did not participate in
the preliminary conference the
temporary suspensions will be
continued. The conference was
continued only to 5 p.m. because of the
great difficulty and significant time
needed to prepare for a trial in such a
complex case.
2. It was moved that all hearings on
all matters concerning the Encina
incident be joint open hearings. The
Council denied the motion as phrased
on the grounds that joint hearings are
inappropriate except concerning the
question of disruption and held that the
Council has the responsibility, both to
the individuals charged and to the
community, to make individual
distinctions as to specific acts and
motivation in findings both of guilt or
innocence and assignment of penalty.

(Fd. Note: The following is a
statement of the Legal Defense
Committee of the April 3rd Movement.)
On Monday of this week, many of
the members of the April 3 Movement
received summonses to "conferences"
with the SJC to arrange and set the
"type, scope, and nature" of hearings
concerning their alleged participation in
incidents said to have taken place in or
around the Huey P. Newton Institute
for the Study of Racism, Imperialism,
and Capitalism (formerly known as
Encina Hall) on or about May 1, 1969.
These conferences were all to take
place the following Wednesday—in most
cases within thirty-six hours of the
serving of notice, and in at least three
cases within twelve hours.
The Legal Defense Committee
frantically arranged a meeting of all
suspended students we knew of—the
Administration and the SJC consistently
refused to release the complete list of
the suspended students until noon on
Wednesday.
At this Tuesday meeting, the Legal
Defense Committee presented a motion
to be made to the SJC requesting a
continuance of all SJC proceedings,
including the conferences, for a
reasonable period of time; this motion
was signed by all fifty-two people
present of sixty-five people who had
been suspended and had not yet
requested or had hearings, we were able
to contact only these fifty-two.
We submitted the signed motion to
the SJC Chairman at approximately
5:10 p.m.
The basis of the motion for a
continuance was two-fold: first,
thirty-six hours (or less) is not enough
time for defendants, who by the terms
of their suspensions are precluded from
entering administrative and other
buildings to gather evidence and in
other ways prepare their defense, to
make the kind of decisions we thought
we might be required to make by the
SJC.
Second, one continuance for a
reasonable period of lime is a basic
element of due process, and also a
statutory guarantee of the Code of Civil
Procedure of the State of California.
The group voted to appear en masse
at the conference room at 8:00 a.m. on
Wednesday morning, which was the
time set for the first conference. Upon
our arrival, we found thai our worst
fears about what to expect had been 100
naive: the SJC, or at least its Chairman,
had prepared a form to be signed
by the accused which can only be
described as vicious.
For one thing, it stated in no
uncertain terms that the
individuals must choose on the
spot either to plead guilty, or to
deny that the incidents of May 1
constituted a disruption and/or
that they were involved—no
provision was made for informing
the accused that they could defer
pleading at that time, or that they
could at least examine the
evidence against them before
pleading.
Secondly, the form contained a
clause which required the accused
to waive their right—guaranteed to
them by both the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, the
SJC's own rules of procedure—to
call witnesses to testify orally in
their behalf (defendants were
advised that they could request
that the SJC allow them to call
such witnesses, but the difference
between being allowed to call
witnesses if the Chairman happens
to agree is far different from a
right to do so if and to the extent
that the defendant involved
wants).
Whether or not the Chairman
was solely responsible for
instigating these inexcusable
violations of fundamental
rights—and there is ample
evidence that he was—he was
without any doubt whatsoever
responsible for their reaching the
defendants as they did. He must
resign immediatley, and must in
no case be allowed to preside over
any further proceedings of the
SJC.
Although conferences had been
scheduled for the hours of 8:00 to
12:00, that entire period was
taken up by negotiations between
the SJC and the defendants. The
SJC held firm in its denial of our

motion for a joint trial, at which
all of the accused would be tried
at the same time.
It also denied the motion for a
continuance of the proceedings,
and simply informed us that only
those students who asked for
individual hearings before 5:00
p.m. yesterday would be assured
of a hearing before the end of the
spring term—and only those
students who have their hearings
scheduled for this term would
have their suspensions lifted.
The Legal Defense Committee
strenuously objected to the 5:00
p.m. deadline. In addition to the
reasons cited above, we made two
crucial and, we feel, reasonable
points. First, we intend to move
that the SJC declare the
temporary suspensions void, in
that they were made pursuant to
an emergency order of the
President (the Daily, April 18)
that is patently illegal.
In the event that this motion is
successful, many of the accused
may want to exercise their
prerogative to defer hearing of
their case until fall quarter, 1969.
If, however, they are forced to
register for individual hearings
before a decision on the
temporary suspensions is reached,
they are precluded from
exercising this prerogative, for if
they fail to appear for their
scheduled hearing they are guilty
of non-cooperation with the SJC,
and subject to further sanctions.
Second, the same argument
was made concerning a written
motion we will file on Thursday
morning for a joint trial. In spite
of being denied this morning, we
feel that we have a strong case for
being tried as a group, in that we
acted as a group and have made

continued. The conference was
continued only to 5 p.m. because of the
great difficulty and significant time
needed to prepare for a trial in such a
complex case.
2. It was moved that all hearings on
all matters concerning the Encina
incident be joint open hearings. The
Council denied the motion as phrased
on the grounds that joint hearings are
inappropriate except concerning the
question of disruption and held that the
Council has the responsibility, both to
the individuals charged and to the
community, to make individual
distinctions as to specific acts and
motivation in findings both of guilt or
innocence and assignment of penalty.

(Fd. Note: The following is a
statement of the Legal Defense
Committee of the April 3rd Movement.)
On Monday of this week, many of
the members of the April 3 Movement
received summonses to "conferences"
with the SJC to arrange and set the
"type, scope, and nature" of hearings
concerning their alleged participation in
incidents said to have taken place in or
around the Huey P. Newton Institute
for the Study of Racism, Imperialism,
and Capitalism (formerly known as
Encina Hall) on or about May 1, 1969.
These conferences were all to take
place the following Wednesday—in most
cases within thirty-six hours of the
serving of notice, and in at least three
cases within twelve hours.
The Legal Defense Committee
frantically arranged a meeting of all
suspended students we knew of—the
Administration and the SJC consistently
refused to release the complete list of
the suspended students until noon on
Wednesday.
At this Tuesday meeting, the Legal
Defense Committee presented a motion
to be made to the SJC requesting a
continuance of all SJC proceedings,
including the conferences, for a
reasonable period of time; this motion
was signed by all fifty-two people
present of sixty-five people who had
been suspended and had not yet
requested or had hearings, we were able
to contact only these fifty-two.
We submitted the signed motion to
the SJC Chairman at approximately
5:10 p.m.
The basis of the motion for a
continuance was two-fold: first,
thirty-six hours (or less) is not enough
time for defendants, who by the terms
of their suspensions are precluded from
entering administrative and other
buildings to gather evidence and in
other ways prepare their defense, to
make the kind of decisions we thought
we might be required to make by the
SJC.
Second, one continuance for a
reasonable period of lime is a basic
element of due process, and also a
statutory guarantee of the Code of Civil
Procedure of the State of California.
The group voted to appear en masse
at the conference room at 8:00 a.m. on
Wednesday morning, which was the
time set for the first conference. Upon
our arrival, we found thai our worst
fears about what to expect had been 100
naive: the SJC, or at least its Chairman,
had prepared a form to be signed
by the accused which can only be
described as vicious.
For one thing, it stated in no
uncertain terms that the
individuals must choose on the
spot either to plead guilty, or to
deny that the incidents of May 1
constituted a disruption and/or
that they were involved—no
provision was made for informing
the accused that they could defer
pleading at that time, or that they
could at least examine the
evidence against them before
pleading.
Secondly, the form contained a
clause which required the accused
to waive their right—guaranteed to
them by both the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968, the
SJC's own rules of procedure—to
call witnesses to testify orally in
their behalf (defendants were
advised that they could request
that the SJC allow them to call
such witnesses, but the difference
between being allowed to call
witnesses if the Chairman happens
to agree is far different from a
right to do so if and to the extent
that the defendant involved
wants).
Whether or not the Chairman
was solely responsible for
instigating these inexcusable
violations of fundamental
rights—and there is ample
evidence that he was—he was
without any doubt whatsoever
responsible for their reaching the
defendants as they did. He must
resign immediatley, and must in
no case be allowed to preside over
any further proceedings of the
SJC.
Although conferences had been
scheduled for the hours of 8:00 to
12:00, that entire period was
taken up by negotiations between
the SJC and the defendants. The
SJC held firm in its denial of our

motion for a joint trial, at which
all of the accused would be tried
at the same time.
It also denied the motion for a
continuance of the proceedings,
and simply informed us that only
those students who asked for
individual hearings before 5:00
p.m. yesterday would be assured
of a hearing before the end of the
spring term—and only those
students who have their hearings
scheduled for this term would
have their suspensions lifted.
The Legal Defense Committee
strenuously objected to the 5:00
p.m. deadline. In addition to the
reasons cited above, we made two
crucial and, we feel, reasonable
points. First, we intend to move
that the SJC declare the
temporary suspensions void, in
that they were made pursuant to
an emergency order of the
President (the Daily, April 18)
that is patently illegal.
In the event that this motion is
successful, many of the accused
may want to exercise their
prerogative to defer hearing of
their case until fall quarter, 1969.
If, however, they are forced to
register for individual hearings
before a decision on the
temporary suspensions is reached,
they are precluded from
exercising this prerogative, for if
they fail to appear for their
scheduled hearing they are guilty
of non-cooperation with the SJC,
and subject to further sanctions.
Second, the same argument
was made concerning a written
motion we will file on Thursday
morning for a joint trial. In spite
of being denied this morning, we
feel that we have a strong case for
being tried as a group, in that we
acted as a group and have made
known from the very beginning of
the April 3 Movement that we
desired to be dealt with as a
group.

Again, if this motion is

Movement's hard-core radical
leaders are coercing the less visible
members of the accused into
foolishly going along with the
group against their own interests,
but he knows he is wrong, and
more importantly, the other
members of the Council are now
beginning to realize that he is
wrong.
In addition, the demand for
amnesty approved unanimously at
the mass meeting of the
Movement yesterday will
strengthen this resolve of the
accused immensely.
We are together, we are right,
and we are going to win. We have
finished jumping, Jack.
(Ed. Note: The Student Judicial Council
released the following statement yesterday.)
The following procedures for a
hearing relating to the incident involving
the occupation of Encina Hall on May 1
have been established: A hearing is
scheduled for Monday morning, May
19, 1969, at 8 o'clock a.m. in the Moot
Court Room of the Stanford Law
School.
The purpose of this hearing is solely
for the purpose of determining whether
or not a disruption occurred in the early
morning hours of May 1 at Encina Hall.
If a disruption is found, then
subsequent to the joint hearing,
individual hearings on the question of
participation in specific acts and
motivation of the individual will be held
for those defendants who have
scheduled a hearing with the Stanford
Judicial Council.
This procedure has been established
in order to assure removal of as many
defendants' temporary suspensions as
possible before the end of this quarter.
For all those accused who requested
hearings before 5 p.m. Wednesday, May
14th, the Stanford Judicial Council has
already recommended to the President
the removal of their temporary
suspensions and has guaranteed to hold
hearings on their cases this quarter.
Furthermore, the Council assures all
other accused individuals who request a
hearing that it will make every effort to
hold hearings this quarter; however, the
SJC cannot guarantee that it will have
time to prepare cases and hold hearings
for those who request hearings
subsequent to the 5 p.m. May 14th
deadline.
Individuals were requested to appear

on May 14th before a committee of the
Council to set dates and times for
hearings in their cases. At this
preliminary conference there was
considerable confusion concerning the
SJC procedures to be followed and
several motions were presented for
Council consideration. The members of
the Council present waited until the full
Council assembled in order to act
officially as a Council on the two
motions presented.
1. It was moved that the Council
grant a continuance of the preliminary
conference until such time as the
defendants could prepare their
responses to the Council's summons.
The Council held that the conference
should be continued only until 5 p.m.
May 14th and that failure to participate
in the conference would not of itself be
cause for any sanction |)y the SJC. In
making this decision the Council noted
that for those who did not participate in
the preliminary conference the
temporary suspensions will be
continued. The conference was
continued only to 5 p.m. because of the
great difficulty and significant time
needed to prepare for a trial in such a
complex case.
2. It was moved that all hearings on
all matters concerning the Encina
incident be joint open hearings. The
Council denied the motion as phrased
on the grounds that joint hearings are
inappropriate except concerning the
question of disruption and held that the
Council has the responsibility, both to

that the defendant involved
wants).
Whether or not the Chairman
was solely responsible for
instigating these inexcusable
violations of fundamental
rights—and there is ample
evidence that he was—he was
without any doubt whatsoever
responsible for their reaching the
defendants as they did. He must
resign immediatley, and must in
no case be allowed to preside over
any further proceedings of the
SJC.
Although conferences had been
scheduled for the hours of 8:00 to
12:00, that entire period was
taken up by negotiations between
the SJC and the defendants. The
SJC held firm in its denial of our

motion for a joint trial, at which
all of the accused would be tried
at the same time.
It also denied the motion for a
continuance of the proceedings,
and simply informed us that only
those students who asked for
individual hearings before 5:00
p.m. yesterday would be assured
of a hearing before the end of the
spring term—and only those
students who have their hearings
scheduled for this term would
have their suspensions lifted.
The Legal Defense Committee
strenuously objected to the 5:00
p.m. deadline. In addition to the
reasons cited above, we made two
crucial and, we feel, reasonable
points. First, we intend to move
that the SJC declare the
temporary suspensions void, in
that they were made pursuant to
an emergency order of the
President (the Daily, April 18)
that is patently illegal.
In the event that this motion is
successful, many of the accused
may want to exercise their
prerogative to defer hearing of
their case until fall quarter, 1969.
If, however, they are forced to
register for individual hearings
before a decision on the
temporary suspensions is reached,
they are precluded from
exercising this prerogative, for if
they fail to appear for their
scheduled hearing they are guilty
of non-cooperation with the SJC,
and subject to further sanctions.
Second, the same argument
was made concerning a written
motion we will file on Thursday
morning for a joint trial. In spite
of being denied this morning, we
feel that we have a strong case for
being tried as a group, in that we
acted as a group and have made
known from the very beginning of
the April 3 Movement that we
desired to be dealt with as a
group.

Again, if this motion is

Movement's hard-core radical
leaders are coercing the less visible
members of the accused into
foolishly going along with the
group against their own interests,
but he knows he is wrong, and
more importantly, the other
members of the Council are now
beginning to realize that he is
wrong.
In addition, the demand for
amnesty approved unanimously at
the mass meeting of the
Movement yesterday will
strengthen this resolve of the
accused immensely.
We are together, we are right,
and we are going to win. We have
finished jumping, Jack.
