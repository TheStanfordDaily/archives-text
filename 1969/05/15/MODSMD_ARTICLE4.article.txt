# Aid Committee Pushes For Loan Repayment
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
The Commiteee for Student Aid has
recommended to President Pitzer that
the University employ a collection
agency to assist repayment of
delinquent student loans.
The decision came several months
after a student referendum
overwhelmingly approved a resolution
asking the University to make "diligent
efforts" in collection.
But the Committee's action reflected
more than student pressures. Last
summer's Appendix 17 of the federal
government's "Guidelines for Student
Loans," states that "a failure to comply
with the principles and requirements
outlined here (employment of a
collection agency), could result in
suspension or even termination of the
loan program."
Joseph Jedd, assistant accounting
manager and a leading proponent of
collection of student loans, reflected on
this pressure. "Before the National
Defense Education Act, the University
had only about $100,000 to loan each
year. Now we lend over two million
dollars a year, more than half of which
comes from the government."

"Governmental insistence caused us
to look at the outstanding loan situation
more seriously and to reappraise our
position. The fact is that student loans
during the 1969-70 year will be cut
considerably, about $300,000. This will
hurt quite a number of students."
The decrease in loans is a direct
result of the smaller pool of funds
caused by loan delinquencies.
Loans Overdue
In detailing the magnitude of the
problem, Jedd revealed that the loans of
278 former students are five years
overdue. These debts represent over
$66,000 in funds that should be
available for further loans.
Jedd related the difficulties of
collection. "We have always relied on
persuasion. We try to be as
understanding as we can. I have a large
file of letters that preceded successful
collections. I look at them and try and
see why they wer<* effective."
Jedd remarked that tin- rate of loan
delinquencies has continued to increasi
inrecentyears at colleges throughout tin
country. He speculated thai the increase
might b»* a reflection of changing
attitudes in our society.
