# A3M Plans Action At SRI-Hanover, Reconnoiters Site In Practice Run
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ LYNNE McCALLISTER 
About 200 members of the April
Third Movement marched by
candlelight to Stanford Research
Institute's Hanover Street facility last
night after voting to disrupt work at the
building Friday morning.
The group stayed at the facility for
slightly more than an hour,
"reconnoitering" the territory for
tomorrow's protest. During their stay,
traffic—including a car driven by SRI
President Charles Anderson—was
disrupted at the intersection of Hanover
and Page Mill Road for a short time.
A window and a plate glass door in
the building were broken and a small
fire was set in a refuse container behind
the building. The blaze was quickly
extinguished by Palo Alto firemen.
Friday's demonstration is in response
to the Trustees' decision to sever the
ties between SRI and the University, an

action the ASM has continually
opposed.
"Guerilla-Type" Tactics
Tactics to be used in the disruption
of the Hanover facility were described
at last night's Movement meeting as
"guerilla-type activities." The purpose is
to stop work done there on
counterinsurgency.
Another reason given for such action
during yesterday's debate was that such
disruptions would make the sale of SRI
more difficult.
The marchers left the Undergraduate
Library about 10:10 p.m. About 150
Movement members walked to the SRI
building, the rest driving to the facility.
Followed by Stanford police cars, the
marchers proceeded up Escondido to
Stanford Avenue and then Hanover
Street, where they began singing
"Solidarity Forever."
Only a handful of plainclothes SRI
security officers were on hand when the
group arrived at the SRI building. The
crowd milled around outside the
facility, but made no major efforts to
enter.
IBM Open
The door to the adjacent
building—belonging to IBM—was open,
however, and several people milled
around the lobby. Inside doors of the
structure were locked, however. The
slogan "Stop War Research Now" was
painted on a door at the top of a flight
of stairs.
Movement members —spurred by a
sign at the entrance to the IBM building
saying "SRl—Second Floor"—tried to
gain entrance to other parts of the
building at first, but stopped when SRI
Public Relations Director Homer
Meador told them that SRI no longer
occupied the building.
A Palo Alto police squad car cruised
by the building at about 10:40 and
received a loud cheer from the
assembled crowd. Other police units
appeared periodically during the group's
stay at the building, but none
stopped—except for one that pulled up
next to the fire behind the building.
Some of the demonstrators
spontaneously decided to block traffic
at the Page Mill-Hanover intersection
about 10:45, and were quickly joined
by most of the crowd. The disruption of
traffic lasted for fifteen minutes.
Disturbed Motorists
Movement members tried to talk
with passing motorists to explain the
issue behind the protest to them. Few
were receptive to the group's efforts,
and most were disturbed with the
unexpected obstacle. One motorist
roared through the crowd, nearly hitting
several demonstrators.
The arrival of SRI President
Anderson was entirely unexpected.
Unrecognized at first, as he pulled up to
the crowd blocking Page Mill Road,
someone finally shouted "There's
Charlie," and many of the group
converged on his car.
Singing "Solidarity Forever," about
75 people surrounded the vehicle. A few
pounded on the car, and then the group
broke into a chant of "Free Charlie."
Finally, persuaded by Leonard Siegel,
the crowd parted to let Anderson'
through.

He entered the intersection just as
the light turned red, turned left down
Hanover Street and then into the
driveway of the SRI facility on the
corner. He was nearly trapped by the
crowd, but quickly drove off.
"My wife and I were just driving by
on the way home," Anderson
commented later. "We had heard there
might be a candlelight march to SRI and
we thought we'd swing by. But we had
no idea traffic was being blocked.
Anderson 'Not Afraid'
"We weren't afraid," he added.
"That didn't even occur to me. We sat
there and figured we didn't want to hurt
anyone and none would want to hurt
us. The crowd was not the happiest
group I ever saw."
After Anderson pulled away, the
crowd left the intersection. "That's
enough practice for now," one of them
said.
At this point, the sound of breaking
glass was heard from the side of the
building facing Page Mill Road. Several
people sprinted to the scene—along with
security personnel inside the
building—and discovered thai a
first-floor window had been broken.
Members of the Movement quickly
began shouting, "Harvey did it!"
referring to Harvey Hukari, Young
Americans for Freedom president and
Arena editor who had tried, with other
YAF members, to block the Movement
from entering Encina Hall two weeks
ago, and who was at the scene last night.
Plate Door Broken
A plate glass door at the back of the
building was also broken, and "Stop
War Research" painted on it.
Bob Beyers, head of the Stanford
News Service who has been sharply
criticized by the Movement in recent
weeks, had a note pad stolen from him
by a demonstrator.
The crowd began to leave around
11:15 and most had gone by 11:30 p.m.
At their meeting earlier, the
Movement passed a motion stating that
no violence would be initiated against
any person at tomorrow's protest.
Tactics to be Decided
Specific tactics, however, are to be
decided by a steering committee
consisting of an elected representative
from each affinity group, and from both
the Black Student Union and the Third
World Liberation Front. The affinity
groups will meet at noon today to elect
representatives for a 1 p.m. meeting of
the committee.
Support from the entire Bay Area
community was requested by the
Movement for the disruption. It was
decided that action against SRI would
be continued at the beginning of next
week.
A straw vote of the A3M showed
almost unanimous support of a demand
to "abolish or restructure" the Board of
Trustees. A demand for amnesty was
also approved by a large majority.
Yesterday's series of A3M meetings
began at 1 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium
with about 800 present. In response to
chairman Paul Rupert's question, "Was
the Trustees' response to A3M's
demands acceptable?," the crowd
roared "hell, no!"
The rest of the meeting proceeded

calmly. Proposals for action were
accepted from the floor. A student
strike, sit-ins at Encina, the Business
School, or the Old Union, and
disruption of the entire Stanford
Industrial Park were proposed, as well as
striking at the Hanover facility of SRI.
Minor proposals included a massive
advertising campaign, to discourage
prospective buyers of SRI, the
enlistment of faculty support, the
organization of a meeting of all
employees of SRI to question the
results of a poll taken by their
management, and the direction of
appeals to the Trustees' wives.
The meeting broke up for an hour,
during which time an estimated 500
people met in affinity groups to discuss
the proposals.
500 Make Decision
The final decision to disrupt the
Hanover facility of SRI was made at a
meeting of approximately 500 people,
after the A3M meeting had moved to
Memorial Church. The vote was almost
unanimous, with 30 against and 20
abstentions.
A straw vote had first showed
support for disrupting the Hanover
facility, and the proposal to strike was
thrown out on the basis of this vote.
LASSU representative Yale
Braunstein expressed his opinion that
off-campus action "will not lead tc
different judicial results than going to
Encina." He cited a clause of the
Student Judicial Council charter that it
has jurisdiction over any student
conduct off campus which may call into
question his academic standing.
Braunstein believes that, since any
Movement action "arose from a campus
issue," the SJC will feel that it has more
than adequate reason to handle such a
disruption.
Cohen Urges Action
Fred Cohen, of the Students for a
Democratic Scoeity, proposed
on-campus action at the Memorial
Church meeting, specifically the taking
of Encina Hall, before moving on SRI.
Any non-violent action, he said, would
lead to police interference. "What we
need, he went on is a sense of outrage
and urgency. What we have instead is
purely a sense of despair."
Cohen also suggested that, in order
to get the support of Bay Area radicals
for an off-campus action, the Movement
had to show that it was willing to put
up a struggle.
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
moved the vote on disruption of the
Hanover facility. He suggested that
Stanford students had been trained to
deal too .much in abstractions, and
should come down to reality.
The Movement received a letter of
support from forty students at
Stanford-in-Germany.
About 200 members of the April

Members of the Movement quickly
began shouting, "Harvey did it!"
referring to Harvey Hukari, Young
Americans for Freedom president and
Arena editor who had tried, with other
YAF members, to block the Movement
from entering Encina Hall two weeks
ago, and who was at the scene last night.
Plate Door Broken
A plate glass door at the back of the
building was also broken, and "Stop
War Research" painted on it.
Bob Beyers, head of the Stanford
News Service who has been sharply
criticized by the Movement in recent
weeks, had a note pad stolen from him
by a demonstrator.
The crowd began to leave around
11:15 and most had gone by 11:30 p.m.
At their meeting earlier, the
Movement passed a motion stating that
no violence would be initiated against
any person at tomorrow's protest.
Tactics to be Decided
Specific tactics, however, are to be
decided by a steering committee
consisting of an elected representative
from each affinity group, and from both
the Black Student Union and the Third
World Liberation Front. The affinity
groups will meet at noon today to elect
representatives for a 1 p.m. meeting of
the committee.
Support from the entire Bay Area
community was requested by the
Movement for the disruption. It was
decided that action against SRI would
be continued at the beginning of next
week.
A straw vote of the A3M showed
almost unanimous support of a demand
to "abolish or restructure" the Board of
Trustees. A demand for amnesty was
also approved by a large majority.
Yesterday's series of A3M meetings
began at 1 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium
with about 800 present. In response to
chairman Paul Rupert's question, "Was
the Trustees' response to A3M's
demands acceptable?," the crowd
roared "hell, no!"
The rest of the meeting proceeded

calmly. Proposals for action were
accepted from the floor. A student
strike, sit-ins at Encina, the Business
School, or the Old Union, and
disruption of the entire Stanford
Industrial Park were proposed, as well as
striking at the Hanover facility of SRI.
Minor proposals included a massive
advertising campaign, to discourage
prospective buyers of SRI, the
enlistment of faculty support, the
organization of a meeting of all
employees of SRI to question the
results of a poll taken by their
management, and the direction of
appeals to the Trustees' wives.
The meeting broke up for an hour,
during which time an estimated 500
people met in affinity groups to discuss
the proposals.
500 Make Decision
The final decision to disrupt the
Hanover facility of SRI was made at a
meeting of approximately 500 people,
after the A3M meeting had moved to
Memorial Church. The vote was almost
unanimous, with 30 against and 20
abstentions.
A straw vote had first showed
support for disrupting the Hanover
facility, and the proposal to strike was
thrown out on the basis of this vote.
LASSU representative Yale
Braunstein expressed his opinion that
off-campus action "will not lead tc
different judicial results than going to
Encina." He cited a clause of the
Student Judicial Council charter that it
has jurisdiction over any student
conduct off campus which may call into
question his academic standing.
Braunstein believes that, since any
Movement action "arose from a campus
issue," the SJC will feel that it has more
than adequate reason to handle such a
disruption.
Cohen Urges Action
Fred Cohen, of the Students for a
Democratic Scoeity, proposed
on-campus action at the Memorial
Church meeting, specifically the taking
of Encina Hall, before moving on SRI.
Any non-violent action, he said, would
lead to police interference. "What we
need, he went on is a sense of outrage
and urgency. What we have instead is
purely a sense of despair."
Cohen also suggested that, in order
to get the support of Bay Area radicals
for an off-campus action, the Movement
had to show that it was willing to put
up a struggle.
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
moved the vote on disruption of the
Hanover facility. He suggested that
Stanford students had been trained to
deal too .much in abstractions, and
should come down to reality.
The Movement received a letter of
support from forty students at
Stanford-in-Germany.
About 200 members of the April
Third Movement marched by
candlelight to Stanford Research
Institute's Hanover Street facility last
night after voting to disrupt work at the
building Friday morning.
The group stayed at the facility for
slightly more than an hour,
"reconnoitering" the territory for
tomorrow's protest. During their stay,
traffic—including a car driven by SRI
President Charles Anderson—was
disrupted at the intersection of Hanover
and Page Mill Road for a short time.
A window and a plate glass door in
the building were broken and a small
fire was set in a refuse container behind
the building. The blaze was quickly
extinguished by Palo Alto firemen.
Friday's demonstration is in response
to the Trustees' decision to sever the
ties between SRI and the University, an

action the ASM has continually
opposed.
"Guerilla-Type" Tactics
Tactics to be used in the disruption
of the Hanover facility were described
at last night's Movement meeting as
"guerilla-type activities." The purpose is
to stop work done there on
counterinsurgency.
Another reason given for such action
during yesterday's debate was that such
disruptions would make the sale of SRI
more difficult.
The marchers left the Undergraduate
Library about 10:10 p.m. About 150
Movement members walked to the SRI
building, the rest driving to the facility.
Followed by Stanford police cars, the
marchers proceeded up Escondido to
Stanford Avenue and then Hanover
Street, where they began singing
"Solidarity Forever."
Only a handful of plainclothes SRI
security officers were on hand when the
group arrived at the SRI building. The
crowd milled around outside the
facility, but made no major efforts to
enter.
IBM Open
The door to the adjacent
building—belonging to IBM—was open,
however, and several people milled
around the lobby. Inside doors of the
structure were locked, however. The
slogan "Stop War Research Now" was
painted on a door at the top of a flight
of stairs.
Movement members —spurred by a
sign at the entrance to the IBM building
saying "SRl—Second Floor"—tried to
gain entrance to other parts of the
building at first, but stopped when SRI
Public Relations Director Homer
Meador told them that SRI no longer
occupied the building.
A Palo Alto police squad car cruised
by the building at about 10:40 and
received a loud cheer from the
assembled crowd. Other police units
appeared periodically during the group's
stay at the building, but none
stopped—except for one that pulled up
next to the fire behind the building.
Some of the demonstrators
spontaneously decided to block traffic
at the Page Mill-Hanover intersection
about 10:45, and were quickly joined
by most of the crowd. The disruption of
traffic lasted for fifteen minutes.
Disturbed Motorists
Movement members tried to talk
with passing motorists to explain the
issue behind the protest to them. Few
were receptive to the group's efforts,
and most were disturbed with the
unexpected obstacle. One motorist
roared through the crowd, nearly hitting
several demonstrators.
The arrival of SRI President
Anderson was entirely unexpected.
Unrecognized at first, as he pulled up to
the crowd blocking Page Mill Road,
someone finally shouted "There's
Charlie," and many of the group
converged on his car.
Singing "Solidarity Forever," about
75 people surrounded the vehicle. A few
pounded on the car, and then the group
broke into a chant of "Free Charlie."
Finally, persuaded by Leonard Siegel,
the crowd parted to let Anderson'
through.

He entered the intersection just as
the light turned red, turned left down
Hanover Street and then into the
driveway of the SRI facility on the
corner. He was nearly trapped by the
crowd, but quickly drove off.
"My wife and I were just driving by
on the way home," Anderson
commented later. "We had heard there
might be a candlelight march to SRI and
we thought we'd swing by. But we had
no idea traffic was being blocked.
Anderson 'Not Afraid'
"We weren't afraid," he added.
"That didn't even occur to me. We sat
there and figured we didn't want to hurt
anyone and none would want to hurt
us. The crowd was not the happiest
group I ever saw."
After Anderson pulled away, the
crowd left the intersection. "That's
enough practice for now," one of them
said.
At this point, the sound of breaking
glass was heard from the side of the
building facing Page Mill Road. Several
people sprinted to the scene—along with
security personnel inside the
building—and discovered thai a
first-floor window had been broken.
Members of the Movement quickly
began shouting, "Harvey did it!"
referring to Harvey Hukari, Young
Americans for Freedom president and
Arena editor who had tried, with other
YAF members, to block the Movement

and Page Mill Road for a short time.
A window and a plate glass door in
the building were broken and a small
fire was set in a refuse container behind
the building. The blaze was quickly
extinguished by Palo Alto firemen.
Friday's demonstration is in response
to the Trustees' decision to sever the
ties between SRI and the University, an

action the ASM has continually
opposed.
"Guerilla-Type" Tactics
Tactics to be used in the disruption
of the Hanover facility were described
at last night's Movement meeting as
"guerilla-type activities." The purpose is
to stop work done there on
counterinsurgency.
Another reason given for such action
during yesterday's debate was that such
disruptions would make the sale of SRI
more difficult.
The marchers left the Undergraduate
Library about 10:10 p.m. About 150
Movement members walked to the SRI
building, the rest driving to the facility.
Followed by Stanford police cars, the
marchers proceeded up Escondido to
Stanford Avenue and then Hanover
Street, where they began singing
"Solidarity Forever."
Only a handful of plainclothes SRI
security officers were on hand when the
group arrived at the SRI building. The
crowd milled around outside the
facility, but made no major efforts to
enter.
IBM Open
The door to the adjacent
building—belonging to IBM—was open,
however, and several people milled
around the lobby. Inside doors of the
structure were locked, however. The
slogan "Stop War Research Now" was
painted on a door at the top of a flight
of stairs.
Movement members —spurred by a
sign at the entrance to the IBM building
saying "SRl—Second Floor"—tried to
gain entrance to other parts of the
building at first, but stopped when SRI
Public Relations Director Homer
Meador told them that SRI no longer
occupied the building.
A Palo Alto police squad car cruised
by the building at about 10:40 and
received a loud cheer from the
assembled crowd. Other police units
appeared periodically during the group's
stay at the building, but none
stopped—except for one that pulled up
next to the fire behind the building.
Some of the demonstrators
spontaneously decided to block traffic
at the Page Mill-Hanover intersection
about 10:45, and were quickly joined
by most of the crowd. The disruption of
traffic lasted for fifteen minutes.
Disturbed Motorists
Movement members tried to talk
with passing motorists to explain the
issue behind the protest to them. Few
were receptive to the group's efforts,
and most were disturbed with the
unexpected obstacle. One motorist
roared through the crowd, nearly hitting
several demonstrators.
The arrival of SRI President
Anderson was entirely unexpected.
Unrecognized at first, as he pulled up to
the crowd blocking Page Mill Road,
someone finally shouted "There's
Charlie," and many of the group
converged on his car.
Singing "Solidarity Forever," about
75 people surrounded the vehicle. A few
pounded on the car, and then the group
broke into a chant of "Free Charlie."
Finally, persuaded by Leonard Siegel,
the crowd parted to let Anderson'
through.

He entered the intersection just as
the light turned red, turned left down
Hanover Street and then into the
driveway of the SRI facility on the
corner. He was nearly trapped by the
crowd, but quickly drove off.
"My wife and I were just driving by
on the way home," Anderson
commented later. "We had heard there
might be a candlelight march to SRI and
we thought we'd swing by. But we had
no idea traffic was being blocked.
Anderson 'Not Afraid'
"We weren't afraid," he added.
"That didn't even occur to me. We sat
there and figured we didn't want to hurt
anyone and none would want to hurt
us. The crowd was not the happiest
group I ever saw."
After Anderson pulled away, the
crowd left the intersection. "That's
enough practice for now," one of them
said.
At this point, the sound of breaking
glass was heard from the side of the
building facing Page Mill Road. Several
people sprinted to the scene—along with
security personnel inside the
building—and discovered thai a
first-floor window had been broken.
Members of the Movement quickly
began shouting, "Harvey did it!"
referring to Harvey Hukari, Young
Americans for Freedom president and
Arena editor who had tried, with other
YAF members, to block the Movement
from entering Encina Hall two weeks
ago, and who was at the scene last night.
Plate Door Broken
A plate glass door at the back of the
building was also broken, and "Stop
War Research" painted on it.
Bob Beyers, head of the Stanford
News Service who has been sharply
criticized by the Movement in recent
weeks, had a note pad stolen from him
by a demonstrator.
The crowd began to leave around
11:15 and most had gone by 11:30 p.m.
At their meeting earlier, the
Movement passed a motion stating that
no violence would be initiated against
any person at tomorrow's protest.
Tactics to be Decided
Specific tactics, however, are to be
decided by a steering committee
consisting of an elected representative
from each affinity group, and from both
the Black Student Union and the Third
World Liberation Front. The affinity
groups will meet at noon today to elect
representatives for a 1 p.m. meeting of
the committee.
Support from the entire Bay Area
community was requested by the
Movement for the disruption. It was
decided that action against SRI would
be continued at the beginning of next
week.
A straw vote of the A3M showed
almost unanimous support of a demand
to "abolish or restructure" the Board of
Trustees. A demand for amnesty was
also approved by a large majority.
Yesterday's series of A3M meetings
began at 1 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium
with about 800 present. In response to
chairman Paul Rupert's question, "Was
the Trustees' response to A3M's
demands acceptable?," the crowd
roared "hell, no!"
The rest of the meeting proceeded

calmly. Proposals for action were
accepted from the floor. A student
strike, sit-ins at Encina, the Business
School, or the Old Union, and
disruption of the entire Stanford
Industrial Park were proposed, as well as
striking at the Hanover facility of SRI.
Minor proposals included a massive
advertising campaign, to discourage
prospective buyers of SRI, the
enlistment of faculty support, the
organization of a meeting of all
employees of SRI to question the
results of a poll taken by their
management, and the direction of
appeals to the Trustees' wives.
The meeting broke up for an hour,
during which time an estimated 500
people met in affinity groups to discuss
the proposals.
500 Make Decision
The final decision to disrupt the
Hanover facility of SRI was made at a
meeting of approximately 500 people,
after the A3M meeting had moved to
Memorial Church. The vote was almost
unanimous, with 30 against and 20
abstentions.
A straw vote had first showed
support for disrupting the Hanover
facility, and the proposal to strike was
thrown out on the basis of this vote.
LASSU representative Yale
Braunstein expressed his opinion that
off-campus action "will not lead tc
different judicial results than going to
Encina." He cited a clause of the
Student Judicial Council charter that it
has jurisdiction over any student
conduct off campus which may call into
question his academic standing.
Braunstein believes that, since any
Movement action "arose from a campus
issue," the SJC will feel that it has more
than adequate reason to handle such a
disruption.
Cohen Urges Action
Fred Cohen, of the Students for a
Democratic Scoeity, proposed
on-campus action at the Memorial
Church meeting, specifically the taking
of Encina Hall, before moving on SRI.
Any non-violent action, he said, would
lead to police interference. "What we
need, he went on is a sense of outrage
and urgency. What we have instead is
purely a sense of despair."
Cohen also suggested that, in order
to get the support of Bay Area radicals
for an off-campus action, the Movement
had to show that it was willing to put
up a struggle.
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
moved the vote on disruption of the
Hanover facility. He suggested that
Stanford students had been trained to
deal too .much in abstractions, and
should come down to reality.
The Movement received a letter of
support from forty students at
Stanford-in-Germany.
About 200 members of the April
Third Movement marched by
candlelight to Stanford Research
Institute's Hanover Street facility last
night after voting to disrupt work at the
building Friday morning.
The group stayed at the facility for
slightly more than an hour,
"reconnoitering" the territory for
tomorrow's protest. During their stay,
traffic—including a car driven by SRI
President Charles Anderson—was
disrupted at the intersection of Hanover
and Page Mill Road for a short time.
A window and a plate glass door in
the building were broken and a small
fire was set in a refuse container behind
the building. The blaze was quickly

weeks, had a note pad stolen from him
by a demonstrator.
The crowd began to leave around
11:15 and most had gone by 11:30 p.m.
At their meeting earlier, the
Movement passed a motion stating that
no violence would be initiated against
any person at tomorrow's protest.
Tactics to be Decided
Specific tactics, however, are to be
decided by a steering committee
consisting of an elected representative
from each affinity group, and from both
the Black Student Union and the Third
World Liberation Front. The affinity
groups will meet at noon today to elect
representatives for a 1 p.m. meeting of
the committee.
Support from the entire Bay Area
community was requested by the
Movement for the disruption. It was
decided that action against SRI would
be continued at the beginning of next
week.
A straw vote of the A3M showed
almost unanimous support of a demand
to "abolish or restructure" the Board of
Trustees. A demand for amnesty was
also approved by a large majority.
Yesterday's series of A3M meetings
began at 1 p.m. in Memorial Auditorium
with about 800 present. In response to
chairman Paul Rupert's question, "Was
the Trustees' response to A3M's
demands acceptable?," the crowd
roared "hell, no!"
The rest of the meeting proceeded

calmly. Proposals for action were
accepted from the floor. A student
strike, sit-ins at Encina, the Business
School, or the Old Union, and
disruption of the entire Stanford
Industrial Park were proposed, as well as
striking at the Hanover facility of SRI.
Minor proposals included a massive
advertising campaign, to discourage
prospective buyers of SRI, the
enlistment of faculty support, the
organization of a meeting of all
employees of SRI to question the
results of a poll taken by their
management, and the direction of
appeals to the Trustees' wives.
The meeting broke up for an hour,
during which time an estimated 500
people met in affinity groups to discuss
the proposals.
500 Make Decision
The final decision to disrupt the
Hanover facility of SRI was made at a
meeting of approximately 500 people,
after the A3M meeting had moved to
Memorial Church. The vote was almost
unanimous, with 30 against and 20
abstentions.
A straw vote had first showed
support for disrupting the Hanover
facility, and the proposal to strike was
thrown out on the basis of this vote.
LASSU representative Yale
Braunstein expressed his opinion that
off-campus action "will not lead tc
different judicial results than going to
Encina." He cited a clause of the
Student Judicial Council charter that it
has jurisdiction over any student
conduct off campus which may call into
question his academic standing.
Braunstein believes that, since any
Movement action "arose from a campus
issue," the SJC will feel that it has more
than adequate reason to handle such a
disruption.
Cohen Urges Action
Fred Cohen, of the Students for a
Democratic Scoeity, proposed
on-campus action at the Memorial
Church meeting, specifically the taking
of Encina Hall, before moving on SRI.
Any non-violent action, he said, would
lead to police interference. "What we
need, he went on is a sense of outrage
and urgency. What we have instead is
purely a sense of despair."
Cohen also suggested that, in order
to get the support of Bay Area radicals
for an off-campus action, the Movement
had to show that it was willing to put
up a struggle.
English Professor H. Bruce Franklin
moved the vote on disruption of the
Hanover facility. He suggested that
Stanford students had been trained to
deal too .much in abstractions, and
should come down to reality.
The Movement received a letter of
support from forty students at
Stanford-in-Germany.
About 200 members of the April
Third Movement marched by
candlelight to Stanford Research
Institute's Hanover Street facility last
night after voting to disrupt work at the
building Friday morning.
The group stayed at the facility for
slightly more than an hour,
"reconnoitering" the territory for
tomorrow's protest. During their stay,
traffic—including a car driven by SRI
President Charles Anderson—was
disrupted at the intersection of Hanover
and Page Mill Road for a short time.
A window and a plate glass door in
the building were broken and a small
fire was set in a refuse container behind
the building. The blaze was quickly
extinguished by Palo Alto firemen.
Friday's demonstration is in response
to the Trustees' decision to sever the
ties between SRI and the University, an

action the ASM has continually
opposed.
"Guerilla-Type" Tactics
Tactics to be used in the disruption
of the Hanover facility were described
at last night's Movement meeting as
"guerilla-type activities." The purpose is
to stop work done there on
counterinsurgency.
Another reason given for such action
during yesterday's debate was that such
disruptions would make the sale of SRI
more difficult.
The marchers left the Undergraduate
Library about 10:10 p.m. About 150
Movement members walked to the SRI
building, the rest driving to the facility.
Followed by Stanford police cars, the
marchers proceeded up Escondido to
Stanford Avenue and then Hanover
Street, where they began singing
"Solidarity Forever."
Only a handful of plainclothes SRI
security officers were on hand when the
group arrived at the SRI building. The
crowd milled around outside the
facility, but made no major efforts to
enter.
IBM Open
The door to the adjacent
building—belonging to IBM—was open,
however, and several people milled
around the lobby. Inside doors of the
structure were locked, however. The
slogan "Stop War Research Now" was
painted on a door at the top of a flight
of stairs.
Movement members —spurred by a
sign at the entrance to the IBM building
saying "SRl—Second Floor"—tried to
gain entrance to other parts of the
building at first, but stopped when SRI
Public Relations Director Homer
Meador told them that SRI no longer
occupied the building.
A Palo Alto police squad car cruised
by the building at about 10:40 and
received a loud cheer from the
assembled crowd. Other police units
appeared periodically during the group's
stay at the building, but none
stopped—except for one that pulled up
next to the fire behind the building.
Some of the demonstrators
spontaneously decided to block traffic
at the Page Mill-Hanover intersection
about 10:45, and were quickly joined
by most of the crowd. The disruption of
traffic lasted for fifteen minutes.
Disturbed Motorists
Movement members tried to talk
with passing motorists to explain the
issue behind the protest to them. Few
were receptive to the group's efforts,
and most were disturbed with the
unexpected obstacle. One motorist
roared through the crowd, nearly hitting
several demonstrators.
The arrival of SRI President
Anderson was entirely unexpected.
Unrecognized at first, as he pulled up to
the crowd blocking Page Mill Road,
someone finally shouted "There's
Charlie," and many of the group
converged on his car.
Singing "Solidarity Forever," about
75 people surrounded the vehicle. A few
pounded on the car, and then the group
broke into a chant of "Free Charlie."
Finally, persuaded by Leonard Siegel,
the crowd parted to let Anderson'
through.

He entered the intersection just as
the light turned red, turned left down
Hanover Street and then into the
driveway of the SRI facility on the
corner. He was nearly trapped by the
crowd, but quickly drove off.
"My wife and I were just driving by
on the way home," Anderson
commented later. "We had heard there
might be a candlelight march to SRI and
we thought we'd swing by. But we had
no idea traffic was being blocked.
Anderson 'Not Afraid'
"We weren't afraid," he added.
"That didn't even occur to me. We sat
there and figured we didn't want to hurt
anyone and none would want to hurt
us. The crowd was not the happiest
group I ever saw."
After Anderson pulled away, the
crowd left the intersection. "That's
enough practice for now," one of them
said.
At this point, the sound of breaking
glass was heard from the side of the
building facing Page Mill Road. Several
people sprinted to the scene—along with
security personnel inside the
building—and discovered thai a
first-floor window had been broken.
Members of the Movement quickly
began shouting, "Harvey did it!"
referring to Harvey Hukari, Young
Americans for Freedom president and
Arena editor who had tried, with other
YAF members, to block the Movement
from entering Encina Hall two weeks
ago, and who was at the scene last night.
Plate Door Broken
A plate glass door at the back of the
building was also broken, and "Stop
War Research" painted on it.
Bob Beyers, head of the Stanford
News Service who has been sharply
criticized by the Movement in recent
weeks, had a note pad stolen from him
by a demonstrator.
The crowd began to leave around
