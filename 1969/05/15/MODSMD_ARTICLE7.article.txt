# Address On Vietnam
## Nixon: Peace Proposals 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP)-P resident
Nixon proposed Wednesday night that
American and North Vietnamese troops
stop fighting in South Vietnam after a
gradual, 12-month withdrawal of most
of their forces.
Staking his political future on his
quest for peace, Nixon recalled a
campaign pledge to end the war with
honor, and he told the nation:
"If I fail to do so, I expect the
American people to hold me
accountable for that failure."
The chief executive outlined what he
termed new initiatives for peace in a
major policy address carried live from
the White House by radio and television.
Mutual Withdrawal
As a first step, he proposed that as
soon as formal agreement or credible
understanding can be reached, there
should begin a mutual withdrawal from
South Vietnam or major portions of
outside troops-Americans, U.S. allies
and North Vietnamese.
This would continue by agreed-upon
stages over a period of a year, after
which the remaining non-South
Vietnamese forces would move into
designated base areas and would cease
combat operations.
Under Nixon's proposal, this mutual
withdrawal would be supervised by an
international body acceptable to both
sides. He suggested that the step be
followed by internationally guaranteed
free elections in the South.
'Comprehensive and Flexible'
Administration sources billed
Nixon's peace proposals as the most
comprehensive, flexible and conciliatory
ever advanced by the U.S. government.
"I would stress," the President said,
"that these proposals are not offered on
a take-it-or-leave-it bitsis. We are quite
willing to consider other approaches
consistent with our principles."
Underlying his peace plan, however,
was a statement of determination to
avoid unilateral withdrawal from South
Vietnam or "a disguised defeat." He
said:
"Let me be quite blunt. Our fighting

men are not going to be worn down; our
negotiators are not going to be talked
down; our allies are not going to be let
down."
The Nixon package will be presented
to Communist negotiators in Paris
Friday by Ambassador Henry Cabot
Lodge, White House sources said.
While concentrating on ideas for
presentation in Paris, Nixon also said,
"The time is approaching when South
Vietnamese forces will be able to take
over some of the fighting fronts now
being manned by Americans."
Sources said some U.S. troops would
be withdrawn from South
Vietnam-regardless of what happens in
Paris-as soon as such a move is deemed a
responsible one by the administration,
and one that officials felt would be
regarded as a sign of confidence in the
allied military position.
While declaring there will be no easy

or quick solution to the war, Nixon said
in an appeal aimed directly at his
homefront audience:
"Nothing could have a greater effect
in convincing the enemy that he should
negotiate in good faith than to see the
American people united behind a
generous and reasonable peace offer."
Political Participation
Besides proposing a phased and
supervised mutual withdrawal of troops
and guaranteed elections in the South,
Nixon said also the United States is
prepared —if Saigon and the Communist
negotiators are willing —to participate in
a political as well as military settlement
in the South.
Stating that his plan has the approval
of President Nguyen Van Thieu of
South Vietnam, Nixon said, "I believe
this proposal for peace is realistic, and
takes account of the legitimate interests
of all concerned."
