# Nixon Proposes New Lottery Draft System

WASHINGTON (AP)-President
Nixon proposed a draft lottery last
Tuesday which would replace the
current draft system in the following
manner:
For the first year, to avoid the
possibility of anyone escaping military
service directly as a result of the
change-over, everyone eligible for draft
call, regardless of age, would be lumped
into a single pool.
In subsequent years, the pool would
be composed only of 19-year-olds and
those who had been deferred earlier for
such reasons as education.
Each year, beginning three months
after Congress granted its permission, a
"selective service calendar" would be
ill aw u up. The 365 dates would be

placed in It) a fish bowl—or something
similar —and drawn at random to
determine the Selective Service
calendar.
All 19-year olds would take their
place in the draft sequences according
to their birthdays as determined by the
lottery.
Then, another lottery would be held
to further refine the sequence. This
fishbowl drawing would jumble the
alphabet and determine a random
alphabetical sequence for 19-year-olds
with the same birthdays.
This national sequence would then
be used by local draft boards to
determine which young men are
drafted.
