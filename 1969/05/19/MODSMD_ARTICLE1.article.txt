# Protester Reports From The Inside

### BARBARA HYLAND Honorary Freshman 
"Up against the wall," the matron
said. I leaned forward with both arms
outstretched bracing the wall while she
frisked me. As she commented on how
tight girls were wearing their pants this
year, I almost laughed at the absurdity
of the situation. If I hadn't been locked
in the Elmwood women's jail at the
time I would have.
The retreat from the Hanover facility
down Page Mill Road had left me in a
daze, and under arrest. Provoked by
some students' hurling rocks, the police
had begun running torwards us. I found
myself on the median strip with two
battalions of policemen carrying billy

clubs coming toward me. My first
instinct was to head for the open field. I
dashed over and momentarily slowed at
the barbed wire fence. At that point the
first officer shoved me and said, "Stay
over there." I stepped aside and another
policeman pushed me and said, "Keep
moving." Completely panicked, I saw
the officer next to me raise his club over
his shoulder."
"Oh please don't,' I begged and
raised my hands to protect my face. He
lowered his club, and shoved me instead
against the fence. Ahead I saw a friend
lying on the ground. Partly under the
fence, she was not moving. As I
approached to see if she was hurt, a few
policement surrounded us and I realized

with a nauseating feeling that I was
caught.
Not Alone
I was not alone. The barb wire fence
contingent grew as the police rounded
up more people. The stories varied, but
it seemed that most students had been
captured because they were hurt or had
stopped to help someone who was.
There were two medics among us,
including my friend under the fence,
who was not hurt but merely entangled
in the barb wire.
One girl had been knocked down to
the ground by the police twice. Finally
one cop had hurled her against the
fence. A boy up ahead, seeing her fall,
came back to help her. He too was
arrested.
It was a very comforting feeling to
think that people were watching out for
one another. I didn't feel alone at any
point, for I believed that if anything
happened to me, there would be
someone who would stop and help.
We were not told that we were
arrested until the police escorted us
"prisoners," as we were labeled, back to
SRI. There we were phtographed and
held in a room with maps of South
America.
After they had collected 13 of us,
they took us out to the paddy wagon
and loaded us on it. The six women
first. The officer said, "Go to the front
of the bus." One girl mimicked in a
Southern accent, "But I wanna sit in the
back of the bus."
All the way to the North County Jail
in Palo Alto bravado prevailed. We sang
"Solidarity Forever" and gave the"V"
sign to people standing along the road.
When we saw the"V" sign returned, it
boosted our morale.

At the North County Jail, the
women were separated from the men
and put in a small cell about 4 feet x 6
feet with high ceilings. The guard shut
the door. It was then that I really felt
like a prisoner.
Bravado faded during the hour we
waited. No one, not even a guard, came
in during that time. Despondently we
talked about not wanting to be martyrs
and the question "Why me?" seemed to
repeat in my mind. It's one thing to
proclaim that you are willing to go to
prison in order to stop
counterinsurgency and war research, yet
it's hard to be dogmatically brave when
you find yourself actually behind bars.
Finally a guard took us from that
cramped cell and brought us to another
which had bathroom facilities.
They then marched us out to the
vestibule where we had entered. Two
matrons, with teased, beehive hairdoes,
proceeded to handcuff us together in
pairs. After getting over the initial
shock, my reaction was to say,"l think
you have the wrong arm," for the way
we were attached the girl I was with
faced forward while I faced backwards.
This, I found out was to prevent us
from skipping away.

We were escorted out to a station
wagon with bars on the windows. The
matrons did not have the key to the
back of the wagon so we had to crawl in
the back seat and climb over the seats.
Transfer to M ilpilas
As we pulled away from North
County, the matrons said we were being
transferred to Milpitas, across the Bay.
We happened to have one til the April 3
Movement song sheets, and had the
words to some of the spring sing songs.
As we sang, we waved our handcuffs at
passing cars. It reminded me ot summer
camp and the camp truck.
While in the station wagon one
matron told us we were charged with
failure to disperse. Having expected to
have been charged with about live
crimes, I felt terribly relieved. We had
been arrested about hall a mile from
SRI and 1 know 1 had been dispersing as
fast as I could.
In beautiful downtown Milpitas, we
pulled into Elmwood, with architecture
similar to Wilbur. Inside they frisked us
and sent us to the observation cell. One
matron said they wanted to keep the
"fighters" separate.
1 then became prisoner 282101 in
the full facc and profile mug shots. We

also had finger prints taken and made
our two allowed phone calls.
The lirst three girls to be processed
had to take showers and wash their hair.
They put on prison underwear, printed
wrap around dresses, and rubber
flip-flop beach shoes.
Two girls went into the dormitory
with the inmates. Until that time the
only contact we had had with our
fellow convicts had been in the
finger-print room. Two drunks, a
shoplifter, and someone involved in a
bar room brawl came in while we were
there.
In the dormitory were some of the
longer term prisoners. The two students
were in the midst of telling the prisoners
about the demonstration, the trustees,
and SKI when the matron returned and
moved them back to the observation
cell.
The observation cell had a bed, a
toilet and a sink. They unlocked the
door now. My fear and tension was
replaced with hunger, boredom, and
curiosity about what was happening
then at SRI with the Movement.
We left that evening about 7 o'clock
singing "Solidarity Forever." The day
could have made a great guerrilla theater
act. Unfortunately, it was all too real.
