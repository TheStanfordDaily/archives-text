## A3M's Tactics Losing Support 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Item one in the A3M's latest
release: "Friday's demonstration
achieved this political impact
through tactics which remained
consistent with the April 3rd
Movement's emphasis on restraint
and political education." Sounds
great.
Item two: "Damage to the SRI
building was estimated at
$10,000 . . ." That strikes me as a
very unique way of showing an
"emphasis on restraint."
The A3M defended their
destruction by pinning blame on
the police, saying, in effect, that
they started it ("We had
previously decided that no
property damage should occur
until the police initiated
violence"). That's a strange bit of
logic. I can point a gun at your
head but if you raise a hand to
defend yourself I'll shoot and
you're to blame because you
"initiated violence." What were
the police supposed to do? Sit
idly by as traffic was disrupted, as
motorists and pedestrians were
endangered, as workers were
prevented from entering their
place of employment? The
demonstrators knew they were
breaking the law and they knew
the police would come to enforce
it. There is no one to blame but
themselves.
The violence will continue
today as the demonstrators
continue on their new course, a
course which I believe is rapidly
alienating them from the support
which the A3M once enjoyed. In
adopting the tactics of those the
demonstrators try to condemn the
A3M has lowered itself to their
level. It is losing the battle, it is
losing our support. The A3M will
win nothing as long as violence is

its means of achievement.

• Activists Cowardly
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have three short points to
make.
First, if sincere in their goals,
the "activists" must review the
fact that in a democratic society,
the freedom to express one's
views does not commit one's
peers, nor one's inferiors, nor
one's superiors to that viewpoint.
One's responsibility is to express
his convictions as convincingly as
he is able, not to substitute brawn
for brain. It is fundamental that
the operational program of the
activists is a mirror image of the
action they most greatly detest,
the Vietnam war.
Secondly, the activists are
cowardly in not approaching the
institutions in our society that are
in fact responsible for the ills they
disclaim, but simply the
institutions that are most
vulnerable to their tactics.
Expediency has displaced
judgment.
Thirdly, it is historically
evident that if the activists are
successful in orientating the
Universities politically, they will
succeed in degrading the quality
of education, while gaining only a
very inferior—for their
purposes—ally.

•Tear Down!
Editor, THE DAILY:
Tear down! Tear down! Tear
down!
Sing out the slogans, unfurl the
red flags,

Be a crusader and watch American
sag.
We have no limit, we have no
bound
And in our mouths, there will
always be found,
Tear down! Tear down! Tear
down!
Guilt is the source upon which we
draw
Open up your hearts and minds
and let it in,
Cast up your lives and dissolve
your sin.
You have no right to keep the
law,
You have no right to preserve
your life.
But we will allow you civil strife.
Denounce materialism—"May I
offer you a lift?"

In my brand new Jaguar with a
four-speed stick shift.
Scream, "Fascist pig and ban the
bomb!"
And don't forget when to use
"Uncle Tom."
See how much fun it is, this
wonderful new game,
You can taunt and provoke police
'til they feel your shame.
Tear down! Tear down! Tear
down!
Have no fear of joining our mob,
for we have a defense,
We use cruelty and hatred and
general abuse.
Never let it be said you've done
America a good deed,
But most of all, let your heavy
hearts proclaim the creed;
Tear down! Tear down! Tear
down!
Otto Holt
