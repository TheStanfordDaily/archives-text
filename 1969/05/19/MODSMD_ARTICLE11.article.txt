# Response To Mrs. Romney
## Moral Crisis Not Just Sexual 
### Jenny Matthews 
The definition of morality has
intrigued me, especially when it is
given by a conservative who clings
to "our great moral tradition" or
"the moral concern of our
American heritage."
Mrs. George Romney, wife of
my former governor in Michigan
who is now Secretary of Housing
& Urban Deveopment, tried to
define morality for a crowd of
people at a panel discussion in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium last
Friday afternoon. Most of the
audience was delighted.
But, Mrs. Romney, when I
tried to sort out your answers, I
primarily found contradiction.
You, Mrs. Romney, talk about
a spiritual crisis in America
because of the evils of "the new
sexual morality." You state that
we have to have a "moral base"
for this country, and that we
should define morality along the
guidelines of "American
tradition."
But how can you be so
concerned with the "immorality"
of things such as sex before
marriage and virtually ignore the
fact that you and your husband
are supporting a government with
sponsors widespread immorality
in Vietnam?
And can you really declare that
"one of the best things about
America is that the government
lets the people decide for
themselves what is morally right,"
when it is telling young men they
have to slaughter human beings
for their country?
How can you stand there and
state, "Democracy is based on
moral concern," when our
"democratic government"
practically ignores the fact that a
lot of the population is morally
outraged about this war in
Vietnam?
When you practically dictate
your own standards of "holiness"as
dogma, Mrs. Romney, a person on
the panel at Dinkelspiel tells you
that "nothing is intrinsically
unholy" when it comes to an
individual's personal life and he

believes that the individual should
define his own sexual morality.
You then retort with examples
of the rape and murder of a girl
and the beating of a child and
declare, "These events are
intrinsically unholy." But then
can you really condone this
"morally concerned democracy"
which initiates beating and
murder in Vietnam on scales
immensely more terrible than
you've described?
When referring to promiscuity,
you condemn the individual's
becoming a sex "object."
But how can you announce, "I
think of human beings as
important creative entities not as
biological products," when you
condone a country that not only
brainwashed its men fighting into
being unthinking murder
machines but rewards them for
bravery for butchering the
enemy (who is not only
considered to be a unhuman
"object" but evil and unworthy).
You, Mrs. Romney, ask the
youth of America to "change
society if you don't like it" but,
in that effort, to "base your
society on the past" and on
"guidelines from God."
Do you really think that a

young person has the power to
change the foulness in the system
when, for example, a number of
young men at the Presidio were
unmercifully punished for singing
one song in protest to
cold-blooded murder?
And when you espouse your
glittering bit of advice that, "The
only way the country is going to
be cleaned up is if each individual
takes a moral stand to clean up his
life and together we can clean up
the country"; do you really think
the people of this country have
the free choice to act on their
moral stand concerning the
military?
How much good has the
individual's moral stand at
Stanford done in stopping
cou nterinsurgency research at
SRI?
One of the most amazing
things you say is, "You can't
impose your freedom on another
person" but what is this country
doing to the North Vietnamese?
What does our government tell
its young men when they decide
it is "intrinsically unholy" to fight
and kill in the Vietnam war?
By your specific statements, of
course, you were primarily
referring to sexual morality and

morality in love relationships. In
fact, it was mentioned by one
panelist in the course of the
discussion that she did not want
to bring politics into it.
I don't deny that you probably
have a very beautiful and
meaningful relationship with your
husband. I don't deny that your
praise of the stable and love-based
family is valid. But "the spiritual
crisis" in this country, it seems to
me, is not being caused by a man
and a woman's decision to rebel
against the traditional sex
standards that society created
generations ago.
There's a greater crisis which
involves the inability of so many
morally-outraged citizens to stop
our government from engaging in
what they feel is an immoral war.
How can you ask for "the
integrity of the home and
magnificence of our youth," when
David Harris is being sent to jail
forbelieving in the brotherhood of
man?
I just don't understand your
definition of "moral concern."
