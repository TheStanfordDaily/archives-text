## Towards Totalitarianism 
### Bill Cohen 
It has come all the way back.
The doctrine of survival of the
fittest that the elite of society
have sanctioned in our
revolutionary "free, democratic
country" where human rights
were the punitive desiderata
toward which our constitution
was directed has finally set this
generation of the elite against
their parents.
We are now thinking in terms
of "if we break a few heads, we'll
radicalize this community."
The opposite seems to me to
be the case. We, the young elite,
are reaching an irreversible
polarity in weltanschau ng
dismetrically opposed to that of
our parents' generation.
We will not consign any part of
this country to starvation and
legal persecution. Most of us
would not risk our lives or even
our social standing to protect the
poor and disadvantaged of our
own country, but what of our
own friends and brothers and
sisters who are more devoted to
social justice than we are?
Will we allow their heads to be
broken for their beliefs?
What I mean is simply this: too
much of our thinking on the
subject of human dignity has been
cushioned by the delusion that we
can proceed as we are and
eventually, nay, soon we will have
real freedom for everyone in our
country. It doesn't have to come
out that our particular
time-life-space ends "happily ever
after."
God may not be there to help
us—this may not be god's country
after all.

There are Germans alive today
(among other nationalities who
can perhaps provide a more
personalized account of a whole
country making a really big
mistake and PAYING FOR IT.
Don't forget, ladies and
gentlemen, that this country had a
civil war only a little more than a
hundred years ago.
Our polarity then was
geographical, you may argue. I
would reply that the school and
ghettos of this country are
increasingly becoming a haven for
the police and the National
Guard.
It can happen HERE—we could
become much more totalitarian.
We'll dismiss the fact that to
many of us it is a personal crusade
to stop coercion ail over the globe
and effect a moral redistribution
of the wealth of the world.
Far more of us won't even risk
our necks to avert the catastrophe
of which we are presently only

marginal victims—so far.
But there are a hell-of-a lot of
us who will be willing to do the
following thing:
Move ourselves in numbers like
several million to one state of our
fair country and attempt to take
it over by gaining control through
the vote (these are quasi-legal and
dowright "illegal" modifications
on this migration plan); OK, we
could stage a real, live exodus to
Canada (more English is spoken
there than Mexico).
This means kiss your mother
and father and your Mustang
good-by, unless they're ready to
do it right —in which case you've
got to bring them along.
The hypocrisy has finally
returned whence it came. Think
about it.
The life you live may be your
own.
