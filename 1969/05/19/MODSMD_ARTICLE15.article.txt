# Tribe Tries Hard But Bruins Sweep
## UCLA Upsets USC In Pac-8 Track Tilt 
### 
Scoring heavily in the quarter mile, shot put, pole vault, and relays,
UCLA edged Oregon for the Pac-8 track championships this weekend,
98-96. Stanford places sixth with 50% points, while USC and OSU,
both undefeated in dual meets, were pushed back to fourth and fifth
respectively.
Rick Tipton rose to national prominance in the high hurdles by
leading from the blocks and holding on to win the race in 13.9. In
reaching the winner's circle, the animated sophomore reversed early
season losses to Oregon's Gary Knoke and USC's Herm Franklin.
Stanford's other fine sophomore hurdler Randy White equaled his
school record of 51.5 in the intermediates by placing third behind the
two men who Tipton managed to defeat. Then, 30 minutes later,
Randy returned to anchor the mile relay team to a seasonal best of
3:12.5, good enough for third.
Favored Tom Colby came from sixth place after the first day of
competition in the javelin in capture second with a toss of 253.1.
Meanwhile triple jumper Tom Massey left the field Friday leading at
50-'/2, but couldm't hold off the challenge of UCLA's Denny Rogers
and also had to set le for second.
Both the mile and 880 had blanket finishes. In the four lapper, no
one wanted the lead, so the ten man field loafed through a 68-second
quarter. At the tape, Allen Sanford of the Indians squeezed in for a
third with a 4:08.5 clocking.
Coming off the final turn of the 880, Pete Fairchild found himself
boxed behind a line of six sprinting runners. Moving to the outside, he
caught favorite Carl Trentadue of USC with a last second lean in
1:49.4. However, his lifetime best effort was only good enough for
sixth as Washington State's Art Sandison won in 1:48.9.
Steve Davis picked up a fifth place for the Tribe in the discus as did
Brook Thomas in the steeplechase. Thomas ran a lifetime best of
9:08.8 but couldn't hang the pace of WSU's Larry Almberg who won
in 8:51.6.
The most improved area for the Indians was the mile relay team of
Rich Faris, Jim Kauffman, Fairchild, and White. With good weather
conditions at the Modesto Relays this Saturday, this foursome has a
shot at the Stanford record of 3:10.
The other points for the Cards came in a sixth place finish in the
spring relay and Peter Boyce's tie for fifth in the high jump.
Every school except California came away with at least one first
place, and UCLA, WSU, and Oregon each grabbed four.
The big surprise was the dominance of the Bruins over cross-town
rival and defending Pac-8 and UCAA champions Southern California.
Aside from Lennox Miller, the Trojan stars simply could not come
home winners. Franklin lost the hurdles to Stanford's Tipton, distance
man Ole Oleson dropped out of the money in the three-mile, and
world record holder Bob Seagren lost the pole vault to UCLA's Dick
Railsback for the second week in a row. The Bruins swept the 440 to
pick up 24 points and the title. There were four meet records broken.


LONE WINNER—Rick Tipton was Stanford's only victor in the Pac-8
championship meet in Corvallis, Oregon over the weekend. Rick gained revenge
over USC's Herm Franklin in the hurdles. The Tribe finished sixth in the upset
meet, won by UCLA.

and also had to set le for second.
Both the mile and 880 had blanket finishes. In the four lapper, no
one wanted the lead, so the ten man field loafed through a 68-second
quarter. At the tape, Allen Sanford of the Indians squeezed in for a
third with a 4:08.5 clocking.
Coming off the final turn of the 880, Pete Fairchild found himself
boxed behind a line of six sprinting runners. Moving to the outside, he
caught favorite Carl Trentadue of USC with a last second lean in
1:49.4. However, his lifetime best effort was only good enough for
sixth as Washington State's Art Sandison won in 1:48.9.
Steve Davis picked up a fifth place for the Tribe in the discus as did
Brook Thomas in the steeplechase. Thomas ran a lifetime best of
9:08.8 but couldn't hang the pace of WSU's Larry Almberg who won
in 8:51.6.
The most improved area for the Indians was the mile relay team of
Rich Faris, Jim Kauffman, Fairchild, and White. With good weather
conditions at the Modesto Relays this Saturday, this foursome has a
shot at the Stanford record of 3:10.
The other points for the Cards came in a sixth place finish in the
spring relay and Peter Boyce's tie for fifth in the high jump.
Every school except California came away with at least one first
place, and UCLA, WSU, and Oregon each grabbed four.
The big surprise was the dominance of the Bruins over cross-town
rival and defending Pac-8 and UCAA champions Southern California.
Aside from Lennox Miller, the Trojan stars simply could not come
home winners. Franklin lost the hurdles to Stanford's Tipton, distance
man Ole Oleson dropped out of the money in the three-mile, and
world record holder Bob Seagren lost the pole vault to UCLA's Dick
Railsback for the second week in a row. The Bruins swept the 440 to
pick up 24 points and the title. There were four meet records broken.


LONE WINNER—Rick Tipton was Stanford's only victor in the Pac-8
championship meet in Corvallis, Oregon over the weekend. Rick gained revenge
over USC's Herm Franklin in the hurdles. The Tribe finished sixth in the upset
meet, won by UCLA.
Scoring heavily in the quarter mile, shot put, pole vault, and relays,
UCLA edged Oregon for the Pac-8 track championships this weekend,
98-96. Stanford places sixth with 50% points, while USC and OSU,
both undefeated in dual meets, were pushed back to fourth and fifth
respectively.
Rick Tipton rose to national prominance in the high hurdles by
leading from the blocks and holding on to win the race in 13.9. In
reaching the winner's circle, the animated sophomore reversed early
season losses to Oregon's Gary Knoke and USC's Herm Franklin.
Stanford's other fine sophomore hurdler Randy White equaled his
school record of 51.5 in the intermediates by placing third behind the
two men who Tipton managed to defeat. Then, 30 minutes later,
Randy returned to anchor the mile relay team to a seasonal best of
3:12.5, good enough for third.
Favored Tom Colby came from sixth place after the first day of
competition in the javelin in capture second with a toss of 253.1.
Meanwhile triple jumper Tom Massey left the field Friday leading at
50-'/2, but couldm't hold off the challenge of UCLA's Denny Rogers
and also had to set le for second.
