# Holed-Out
## Trojans Nip Cards 
### 
Stanford golfers rested in
Seattle Friday night, leading the
rest of the Pacific-8 in the race for
the championship. The defending
league titlists were out ahead of
USC, their main challengers.
Saturday evening was not as
happy in the Indian camp. The
lead had vanished, the tournament
was over, and the crown returned
to downtown Los Angeles with
the Trojans.
"The Trojans have the kind of
team that looks unbeatable on
paper," said Stanford coach Bud
Finger earlier in the season. Not
only were they unbeatable on
paper, but also on the course. SC
left the rest of the field behind in
winning the title by 12 strokes.
Southern Cal finished with a
72-hole team total of 1172 to
1184 for the runner-up Cards.
UCLA was third with 1195,
Oregon fourth with 1199, and
Oregon State fifth with 1213.
Washington State followed in at
1222, California was next, 1228,
and host Washington politely
wound up in the cellar with a
1240 total.

The top individual score was
carded by Bob Allard of USC, a
289. Sandy Adelman of Stanford
tied with Bruce Osborne of OSU
for second with 290. For the
Indians, Tom Watson came in
with a 292, Bob Riddell had 297,
and captain Greg Pitzer ended up
with a 305.
