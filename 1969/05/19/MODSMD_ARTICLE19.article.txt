# Indians Win 2, But Title Goes To UCLA
## 
### JOHN ARTHUR 
At twenty-one minutes past four Saturday afternoon Stanford
shortstop Russ Tweet backed into the hole, fielded a grounder, set
himself and threw to teammate Dick Borchers at second base to retire
the lead runner and bring an end to the baseball season which had
begun for some players nearly nine months ago.
The putout wrapped up a satisfying 4-3 win for the Indians over
California at Berkeley. It also assured Stanford of its eleventh straight
win over the Bears and dealt the Tribe's Phil Keller his eighth win of
the long campaign.
But the victory, along with Friday's 9-4 triumph over the Bears
here, won't give the Indians a berth in the NCAA's District 8 playoffs
and the chance to advance to the College World Series in Omaha. That
plum goes this year to the UCLA Bruins—their first conference title in
twenty-five years.
LICLA clinched first place with a pair of convincing wins over USC
in Los Angeles over the weekend. The Bruins thus end the season with
17 wins and 4 losses, one game ahead of Stanford's 16-5 pace. And on
Friday Pac-8 Director Tom Hamilton threw out a protest lodged by
Stanford coach Ray Young over a delay before last Tuesday's game
against Oregon in Eugene.
Since the rejection of the protest appears to be in direct violation
of the NCAA baseball rules which supposedly govern Pac-8 play,
Young plans to ask the league's NCAA representative, coach Chuck
Brayton of Washington State, to look into the matter. Hamilton, in
announcing his decision, said that the 20-minute delay was due to rain
earlier in the day and had no effect on the outcome of the game. But
neither the umpires nor the Stanford team was informed of the cause
of the delay at the time.
Friday's Stanford-Cal game, played before a sun-drenched
gathering in Sunken Diamond, was dominated by the near-perfect
pitching of Bob Boone and neatly punctuated with clutch hits off the
bats of two other seniors, Bob Edie and Mark Marquess. Boone
scattered four hits—including two homers - while striking out seven
and walking none en route to his ninth win of the year against one
loss. At one point he retired 13 batters in a row.
Edie and Marquess each knocked in a pair of runs, Edie with three
hits and Marquess with an eighth inning triple up the alley in left
center. Borchers also had a pair of safeties as the Tribe went ahead
early but had to explode for four runs in the eighth to bolster a
margin which had shrunk to one. In all, the Indians collected ten hits.
At UCLA's Sawtelle Field, meanwhile, 2,500 fans saw the Bruins
breeze past the defending champ USC Trojans 9-4. Steve Price
smashed two homers and Jake Molina hit a grand slam to pace the
Bruins, who led-9-1 after six innings. Rick Pope got the win as USC
absorbed its worst beating of the Pac-8 season.
Stanford consequently went into Saturday's game with full
knowledge that a playoff berth was out of reach. But
co-championship of the conference wasn't, so there was no lack of
motivation. Keller was shakey from the start, giving up one run in the
first and two more in the fourth, but the Tribe's patented big inning
bailed him out. The Indians put four runs across with two walks and
singles by Ron Shotts, Edie and Jack Hodges. In the fourth Hodges
went to third on his hit after Cal's right-fielder tried to play the ball
with his foot. That proved unsuccessful, and Jack cruised into the hot
corner as the ball rolled to the fence.
Given a lead to protect, Keller settled down and proceeded to
retire 16 of the 17 batters he faced. He fanned eight and walked five
while picking up his sixth league win of the year. Overall he's 8-3.
Cal's Mike Baldwin struck out 12 and held the Tribe to seven hits, two
of which were collected by the torrid Edie, finishing the year in a
blaze of glory. UCLA crushed USC 14-5 in their second game.

LICLA clinched first place with a pair of convincing wins over USC
in Los Angeles over the weekend. The Bruins thus end the season with
17 wins and 4 losses, one game ahead of Stanford's 16-5 pace. And on
Friday Pac-8 Director Tom Hamilton threw out a protest lodged by
Stanford coach Ray Young over a delay before last Tuesday's game
against Oregon in Eugene.
Since the rejection of the protest appears to be in direct violation
of the NCAA baseball rules which supposedly govern Pac-8 play,
Young plans to ask the league's NCAA representative, coach Chuck
Brayton of Washington State, to look into the matter. Hamilton, in
announcing his decision, said that the 20-minute delay was due to rain
earlier in the day and had no effect on the outcome of the game. But
neither the umpires nor the Stanford team was informed of the cause
of the delay at the time.
Friday's Stanford-Cal game, played before a sun-drenched
gathering in Sunken Diamond, was dominated by the near-perfect
pitching of Bob Boone and neatly punctuated with clutch hits off the
bats of two other seniors, Bob Edie and Mark Marquess. Boone
scattered four hits—including two homers - while striking out seven
and walking none en route to his ninth win of the year against one
loss. At one point he retired 13 batters in a row.
Edie and Marquess each knocked in a pair of runs, Edie with three
hits and Marquess with an eighth inning triple up the alley in left
center. Borchers also had a pair of safeties as the Tribe went ahead
early but had to explode for four runs in the eighth to bolster a
margin which had shrunk to one. In all, the Indians collected ten hits.
At UCLA's Sawtelle Field, meanwhile, 2,500 fans saw the Bruins
breeze past the defending champ USC Trojans 9-4. Steve Price
smashed two homers and Jake Molina hit a grand slam to pace the
Bruins, who led-9-1 after six innings. Rick Pope got the win as USC
absorbed its worst beating of the Pac-8 season.
Stanford consequently went into Saturday's game with full
knowledge that a playoff berth was out of reach. But
co-championship of the conference wasn't, so there was no lack of
motivation. Keller was shakey from the start, giving up one run in the
first and two more in the fourth, but the Tribe's patented big inning
bailed him out. The Indians put four runs across with two walks and
singles by Ron Shotts, Edie and Jack Hodges. In the fourth Hodges
went to third on his hit after Cal's right-fielder tried to play the ball
with his foot. That proved unsuccessful, and Jack cruised into the hot
corner as the ball rolled to the fence.
Given a lead to protect, Keller settled down and proceeded to
retire 16 of the 17 batters he faced. He fanned eight and walked five
while picking up his sixth league win of the year. Overall he's 8-3.
Cal's Mike Baldwin struck out 12 and held the Tribe to seven hits, two
of which were collected by the torrid Edie, finishing the year in a
blaze of glory. UCLA crushed USC 14-5 in their second game.
At twenty-one minutes past four Saturday afternoon Stanford
shortstop Russ Tweet backed into the hole, fielded a grounder, set
himself and threw to teammate Dick Borchers at second base to retire
the lead runner and bring an end to the baseball season which had
begun for some players nearly nine months ago.
The putout wrapped up a satisfying 4-3 win for the Indians over
California at Berkeley. It also assured Stanford of its eleventh straight
win over the Bears and dealt the Tribe's Phil Keller his eighth win of
the long campaign.
But the victory, along with Friday's 9-4 triumph over the Bears
here, won't give the Indians a berth in the NCAA's District 8 playoffs
and the chance to advance to the College World Series in Omaha. That
plum goes this year to the UCLA Bruins—their first conference title in
twenty-five years.
