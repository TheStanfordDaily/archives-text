# SRI Obtains Injunction; Movement Plans Action
## 
### LANG ATWOOD FRANK MILLER 
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
obtained a temporary restraining order
from Superior Court Judge Stanley R.
Evans Sunday that enjoins 27
individuals and 12 organizations from
"repeated trespass and unlawful
interference with a lawful business."
SRI President Charles Anderson
contacted in his home late last night
explained that the TRO enjoins the
defendants from entering the grounds
of any SRI facility, preventing
employees from entering SRI and
defacing property at any SRI facility.
Named as defendants were: Marc
Heller, Eric Miller, Allan Christelow, Jr.,
Yale Braunstein, Mary Hanson, H. Bruce
Franklin, Barbara Levin, Steve
Weissman, Richard Zdarko, Paul
Rupert, Victor von Schlegel, John
Shoch, Lauren Bechtel, John Gostovich,
Paul Witt, James Shoch, Harry Cleaver,
Fred Cohen, Scott Johnson, Jeanne
Friedman, Anne Bauer, Leonard Siegel,
Doron Weinberg, Larry Priestly, Paul
Bernstein, Hallan Hamiltion, Rodney

for a Democratic Society, Resistance,
Peninsula Observer, Stanford United
Christian Ministry Staff, Peninsula Red
Guard, United Students Movement,
Committee for New Politics, Palo Alto
Concerned Citizens, Mid-Peninsula Free
University, North Santa Clara Peace and
Freedom Movement, American
Federation of Teachers Local no. 1816
and Doe 1 through Doe 500 inclusive.
SRI is listed as the plaintiff.
Affadavits Attached
The order had copies of supporting
affidavits attached, testifying to the
participation of the defendants. These
affidavits were signed by: Harvey
Hukari, Jr., Gilbert Diaz, Douglas B.
Greene, Homer Meadors, Charles
Anderson, Eckhard Schultz, Claude
Long, Jackson R. Booth, Lee H. Long
and Michael Hirsch.
The Daily was unable to obtain a
copy of the order in time for
publication this morning, the complete
text will be printed in tomorrow's
paper.
Three injunctions were served early
this morning by Harvey Hukari and
Gilbert Diaz, on members of the April
3rd Movement.
The Movement decided earlier to

move today against the Stanford
Research Institute, in action similar to
that of last Friday. At the A3M meeting
yesterday afternoon it was decided to
let the tactics committee determine
whether to march on the Hanover
facility or the main Menlo Park branch,
or both.
The A3M met at White Plaza this
morning at 6:30 to learn the decision of
the tactics committee and then take
action. There will be both peaceful
picketing and more militant action with
students working out of affinity groups.
The action today follows a protest
last Friday by 400 students at the
Hanover facility of SRI that ended
when 150 policemen used tear gas to
disperse the crowd. 16 people were
arrested at the demonstration.
Those arrested were released within 3
to 4 hours when the required bail was
put up by the ASSU student bail fund.
The Palo Alto Times ran an incorrect
story on Saturday charging that the
funds were withdrawn by LASSU
speaker Yale Braunstein without ASSU
permission.
Flexibility for Committee
At yesterday afternoon'*; "neeting the
group overwhelmingly voted to give the

tactics committer I lexibility regarding
the decision for action today. Straw
votes taken at the meeting were not
decisive (concerning where the group
wanted to demonstrate).

Those students arrested are

Palo Alto Municipal Court for

funds from the ASSU student bail fund
set up 3 or 4 months ago.
According to Yale Braunstein,

student legislature speaker, any student
may borrow against the fund at the
interest rate of V2 of 1 percent per
month for bail. A cosigner is needed,
and the action must be approved by an
ASSU representative.
The legislature has allotted $5000 for
the fund from contingency
funds—reserves built up from past
years—and not from student fees.
The bail fund has been used several
times earlier in the quarter, although
this has not been well publicized.

Affadavits Attached
The order had copies of supporting
affidavits attached, testifying to the
participation of the defendants. These
affidavits were signed by: Harvey
Hukari, Jr., Gilbert Diaz, Douglas B.
Greene, Homer Meadors, Charles
Anderson, Eckhard Schultz, Claude
Long, Jackson R. Booth, Lee H. Long
and Michael Hirsch.
The Daily was unable to obtain a
copy of the order in time for

text will be printed in tomorrow's

Three injunctions were served early
this morning by Harvey Hukari and
Gilbert Diaz, on members of the April
3rd Movement.
The Movement decided earlier to

move today against the Stanford
Research Institute, in action similar to
that of last Friday. At the A3M meeting
yesterday afternoon it was decided to
let the tactics committee determine
whether to march on the Hanover
facility or the main Menlo Park branch,
or both.
The A3M met at White Plaza this
morning at 6:30 to learn the decision of
the tactics committee and then take
action. There will be both peaceful
picketing and more militant action with
students working out of affinity groups.
The action today follows a protest
last Friday by 400 students at the
Hanover facility of SRI that ended
when 150 policemen used tear gas to
disperse the crowd. 16 people were
arrested at the demonstration.
Those arrested were released within 3
to 4 hours when the required bail was
put up by the ASSU student bail fund.
The Palo Alto Times ran an incorrect
story on Saturday charging that the
funds were withdrawn by LASSU
speaker Yale Braunstein without ASSU
permission.
Flexibility for Committee
At yesterday afternoon'*; "neeting the
group overwhelmingly voted to give the

tactics committer I lexibility regarding
the decision for action today. Straw
votes taken at the meeting were not
decisive (concerning where the group
wanted to demonstrate).

sale of SRi. Lee Herzenberg attempted
to contact Pitzer last night but he could
not be reached. The committee will
attempt to serve as a link between the
trustees and the movement.
Those students arrested are
scheduled to appear on May 26, in the
Palo Alto Municipal Court for
arraignment. They were bailed out using
funds from the ASSU student bail fund
set up 3 or 4 months ago.
According to Yale Braunstein,

student legislature speaker, any student
may borrow against the fund at the
interest rate of V2 of 1 percent per
month for bail. A cosigner is needed,
and the action must be approved by an
ASSU representative.
The legislature has allotted $5000 for
the fund from contingency
funds—reserves built up from past
years—and not from student fees.
The bail fund has been used several
times earlier in the quarter, although
this has not been well publicized.
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
obtained a temporary restraining order
from Superior Court Judge Stanley R.
Evans Sunday that enjoins 27
individuals and 12 organizations from
"repeated trespass and unlawful
interference with a lawful business."
SRI President Charles Anderson
contacted in his home late last night
explained that the TRO enjoins the
defendants from entering the grounds
of any SRI facility, preventing
employees from entering SRI and
defacing property at any SRI facility.
