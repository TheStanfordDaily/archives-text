# Westwood Winners
## Stanford Tennismen Stopped 
### FRED MANN 
In was a bleak day for the
University of Southern California
athletic department. They had
gone into this big Pacific-8
championship weekend the
kingpin in baseball, track, and
tennis, but wound up losers in all
three departments. True, they did
regain the Pac-8 golf title they had
lost the year before, but the losses
were tragic to the Trojans. All of
them came at the hands of UCLA.

One of the SC defeats occurred
at Stanford. The sport was tennis.
But Troy was not the only loser.
Stanford also went down to
defeat in their battle for third
place against California. It was the
first time in four years that USC
had not won the championship,
and also the first time in as long
that Cal and nipped Stanford for
the show spot.
The Bruins edged USC, 5-4 to
take the title, just as the Bears
from Berkeley took Coach Dick
Gould's netters for third, 5-4.
Washington took fifth place over
Oregon, 8-1, and Oregon State
whipped hapless Washington State
for next-to-last, 9-0.
The Bruin victory was their
second straight over the Trojans.
They destroyed SC in the final
dual match of the year, 7-2. The
Westwooders won both the first
and second singles matches from
USC stars Bob Lutz and Joaquin
Loyo Mayo and also took two of
three doubles matches for the
win. Roy Barth beat Lutz 3-6,
12-10, 6-4, in a long, tough
match. SC's Loyo Mayo won the
first set of his match, as Lutz did,
but fell to Jeff Borowiak, 4-6, 7-5,
6-3.
For Stanford, the loss was
again caused by the doubles
matches. The Tribe won four of
the six singles events, but dropped
all three doubles matches to Cal.
In the top singles, the Bears'
improving Bob Alloo took the toll
of Dean Schlobohm, 6-4, 6-4.
Stan Pasarell proved his back
was in good shape as he beat Cal's
Mike Mullan, 6-4, 6-1. John
Spiegel also added a win for the
hosts as he defeated Larry Parker,
6-1, 6-4. Bill Atkins nailed Mike
Gillfillan, 6-4, 6-1. Chuck Alloo
knocked off Gary Rippensteil in
straight sets, 6-2, 7-5, but Paul
Marienthal lost his singles to
Berkeley's Pete Hofmann, 6-1,
6-3.
Stanford took Cal to three sets
in all the doubles matches, but
came out on the short end each

time. Cal's Bob AIIoo teamed with
Gillfillan to beat his brother
Chuck and Pasarell, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4,
in the prime doubles match.
The finals marked the end of
college careers for seniors
Schlobohm and Alloo. But next
season should prove to be a great
one for Stanford tennis. A
fantastic freshman squad will
supplement the remaining varsity
team. The resulting combination
may well be one of the top groups
in the nation.
For the first time in years, the
Pac-8 may be more than just a
two way race.

In the top singles, the Bears'
improving Bob Alloo took the toll
of Dean Schlobohm, 6-4, 6-4.
Stan Pasarell proved his back
was in good shape as he beat Cal's
Mike Mullan, 6-4, 6-1. John
Spiegel also added a win for the
hosts as he defeated Larry Parker,
6-1, 6-4. Bill Atkins nailed Mike
Gillfillan, 6-4, 6-1. Chuck Alloo
knocked off Gary Rippensteil in
straight sets, 6-2, 7-5, but Paul
Marienthal lost his singles to
Berkeley's Pete Hofmann, 6-1,
6-3.
Stanford took Cal to three sets
in all the doubles matches, but
came out on the short end each

time. Cal's Bob AIIoo teamed with
Gillfillan to beat his brother
Chuck and Pasarell, 6-4, 2-6, 6-4,
in the prime doubles match.
The finals marked the end of
college careers for seniors
Schlobohm and Alloo. But next
season should prove to be a great
one for Stanford tennis. A
fantastic freshman squad will
supplement the remaining varsity
team. The resulting combination
may well be one of the top groups
in the nation.
For the first time in years, the
Pac-8 may be more than just a
two way race.
In was a bleak day for the
University of Southern California
athletic department. They had
gone into this big Pacific-8
championship weekend the
kingpin in baseball, track, and
tennis, but wound up losers in all
three departments. True, they did
regain the Pac-8 golf title they had
lost the year before, but the losses
were tragic to the Trojans. All of
them came at the hands of UCLA.

One of the SC defeats occurred
at Stanford. The sport was tennis.
But Troy was not the only loser.
Stanford also went down to
defeat in their battle for third
place against California. It was the
first time in four years that USC
had not won the championship,
and also the first time in as long
that Cal and nipped Stanford for
the show spot.
The Bruins edged USC, 5-4 to
take the title, just as the Bears
from Berkeley took Coach Dick
Gould's netters for third, 5-4.
Washington took fifth place over
Oregon, 8-1, and Oregon State
whipped hapless Washington State
for next-to-last, 9-0.
The Bruin victory was their
second straight over the Trojans.
They destroyed SC in the final
dual match of the year, 7-2. The
Westwooders won both the first
and second singles matches from
USC stars Bob Lutz and Joaquin
Loyo Mayo and also took two of
three doubles matches for the
win. Roy Barth beat Lutz 3-6,
12-10, 6-4, in a long, tough
match. SC's Loyo Mayo won the
first set of his match, as Lutz did,
but fell to Jeff Borowiak, 4-6, 7-5,
6-3.
For Stanford, the loss was
again caused by the doubles
matches. The Tribe won four of
the six singles events, but dropped
all three doubles matches to Cal.
