## Bizarre Brando Pseudo-Mystery 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The Night of the Following
Day is a movie that suffers from
having too little common sense of
its own, but paradoxically
benefits by being derivative of
numerous film genres. While the
lack of a unifying factor prevents
the picture from being entirely
successful (and causes it, at times,
to be overwhelmingly
aggravating), the unrelated and

conflicting sytles and motifs
which collide throughout cause
this psychological pseudo-mystery
to be one of the most bizarre,
perpelxing films in recent
memory.
Various components of the
picture are traceable to wildly
divergent origins. The plot,
dealing with a ransom kidnapping
by a gang of professional misfits,
is firmly in the tradition of the
grade-B American melodrama.
However, the settings are not the
dark alleys of Chicago or the
sewers of Los Angeles but the
bleak, lonely northern French
seacoast, reminiscent of A Man
and a Woman or, more strongly,
Becket. The photography by Willi
Kurant, who worked with Godard
on Masculin Feminin, utilizes
unusual and evocative
compositions and the color work
in characteristic of European labs.
Beyond this, the principle premise
of the film is of a psychological
and moralistic nature. The
personal tensions between the
four gangsters receive more play
than the crime itself, somewhat as
if the bay-side talk between Steve
McQueen and Jacqueline Bisset in
Bullitt were extended into an
abstract feature-length film. This
combination of idioms creates an
instriguing cinematic landscape of
divided attention.
Brando Incongruous
Despite the aesthetic oddities,
the single most incongruous factor
in the film is the presence of
Marlon Brando in the pivotal role.
Topped with shaggy, bleached
hair and considerably slimmed
down, Brando looks about 25
years old; he could still make The
Wild One today. As in most of
recent films, Brando is not

equipped here with a vehicle
which allows his performance to
be taken very seriously but his
appearance in The Night of the
Following Day is so irresistably
absurd that it both reveals that
the "old Brando" is not dead and
that the actor, like Orson Welles,
is still young enough to make
significant artistic contributions if
given half a chance.
Brando's recent misfortunes
can be attributed to bad choices
of scripts and directors and lack
of luck. After culminating his
prosperity in the '50's by
directing the financially disastrous
One-Eyed Jacks, Brando returned
to acting exclusively. He was set
to play the title role in Lawrence
of Arabia but backed down when
the temperate climate offered by
the Mutiny on the Bounty
locations seemed more enticing.
Last year he was signed to star in
The Arrangement, a forthcoming
production by Elia Kazan, who
directed Brando in his best
performances (A Streetcar Named
Desire, On the Waterfront, Viva
Zapata) but, becoming highly
involved in politics, and actor
announced that he would appear
only in films which advanced his
personal social and political
philosophies. He has since
completed Gillo (Battle of
Algiers) Pontecorvo's dissection of
a South American revolution,
Ouenuda, while Kirk Douglas
filled the vacant part in The
Arrangement.
Promising Scripts
In between these apparent
lapses in judgment, Brando chose
promising scripts with
undistinguished directors (The
Ugly American, Morituri), worked

with visually creative directors on
ill-conceived material (Arthur
Penn on The Chase Sidney Furie
on The Appaloosa and John
Huston on Reflections in a
Golden Eye) or simply mis-cast
(Bedtime Story, A Countess from
Hong Kong). The Night of the
Following Day belongs to the
second group, Producer-writer
director Hubert Cornfield has an
imaginative and sometimes
striking visual sense, notably
evident in the climatic
shoot-outbetween Brando and
heavy Richard Boone on the
beach at dawn, but he is no
screenwriter. Many of the
exchanges of dialogue are flat if
not embarrassing, but again,
Brando mumbles enough
"Oh-Jesus Christ-ma n-but-babv"

lines to make one's constenation
with Cornfield bearable. Brando is
a true star and thus, by definition,
is an actor who continues to be a
magnetic force in a film no matter
what the material. He is perhaps
the only remaining screen
personality whose connection
with a given film justifies seeing it
regardless of its title or director.
Doubtless, our dreams or seeing
his play Hamlet will go unfulfilled
(though he is still physically
suited to the part) but Brando has
at least ten "young" years left in
him; hopefully, his artistic
sensibilities will soon achieve the
acuity of his political convictions.
If the two meshed, performances
of unprecedented strength and
awareness could result.
