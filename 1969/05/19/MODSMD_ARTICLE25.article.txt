At the word hypocrisy, booing and
hissing came from the audience which
drowned out much of the speech. There
were also a few cheers and a few raised
"V" signs.
Half of Pitzer's address to the alumni
dealt with current campus disorders.
"We have new judicial machinery that is
badly burdened," he told them, "but it
is still intact and internal penalties are in
effect with community support."
"If the University must repeatedly
rely on outside forces, as we have so
unhappily had to do once this Spring,
Stanford and the idea of the University
to which all of us are dedicated will
have suffered a damaging blow," he
went on.
Pitzer said he felt the Board of
Trustees "came to a very reasonable
decision" when they announced their
decision to sever SRI from the
University. He emphasized the financial
problems involved in the assumption of
responsibility for applied research
activity.
Federal Policy
Pitzer described the decision of the
Faculty Senate to end secret research,
saying "I endorsed this action and made

it clear that it implies no conflict with
the policies of our federal government."
Those visiting the Conference were
presented with lectures on topics
ranging from "Feminism and Black
Power" to "Seafloor Spreading." A new
black play, "Electronic Nigger" was
presented, and the visitors had the
opportunity to visit an archeological dig
in East Palo Alto.
The student panel on campus issues,
at which Hayes presented his proposal
for a reconstruction of the Board of
Trustees, consisted of those students
who had written articles for the recent
Alumni Almanac.
Student Panel
They were: Dave Jones, Chairman of
the Committee for New Politics, Fred
Alvarez, of the Mexican American
Student Confederation, Doug Chandler,
President of the Inter-Fraternity
Council, Harvey Hukari, President of
the Young Americans for Freedom, Jim
Shoch of the Students for a Democratic
Society, and Leo Bazille, Vice-Chairman
of the Black Student Union.
Jones also spoke in favor of a
restructuring of the Board of Trustees.
He called their decision "an arrogant
rejection of this community's will."
