## Lease Ends In June 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The moving of the SRI-Hanover
facility to SRl's main building in Menlo
Park continued at its normal pace over
the weekend, despite the threat of
further disruption from students
objecting to research policy. The move
has been underway since December.
Homer Meaders, publicity director
for SRI, stated "We're going to be in

;t< building at least another month,
bit there will be fewer people each
weekend."
According to Meaders, before the
weekend only about 20 of
SRI-Hanover's researchers had moved.
110 people had been assigned to
Hanover when employment there was at
its peak.
The lease of the SRI-Hanover
building ends on June 15.
The move between facilities is
co-ordinated by departments. This
weekend the Systems Analysis
department, which has 40 people
attached to it, was moved. This brings
the number of researchers currently
employed at SRI-Hanover down to 50.
All of these are employed in the
Operations Analysis department.
Those employees who occupied
offices which had windows broken
during Friday's disruption have moved
to offices inside the building. These
offices have no windows to the outside.
