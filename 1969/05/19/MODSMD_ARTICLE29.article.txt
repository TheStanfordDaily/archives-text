CAC Statement
The April Third Movment has now
taken its systems of disruption and
intimidation from the Stanford campus
to the mid-peninsula community at
large.
The public has created a set of rules
to protect itself from criminal acts. The
Coalition for an Academic Community
believes if these rules are to be effective,
they must apply equally to all;
self-righteously inspired students can be
no exception.
The A3M caused serious disruptions
on Friday, May 16, in the Stanford
Industrial Park, and reports indicate it is
likely it will try to do so again on
Monday, May 19. From past
observations of this movement, the CAC
suggests to the public for Monday and
the few days following: 1. Curiosity
seekers should stay clear of the area.
2. Industrial Park employees should
consider alternate routes and forms of
transportation, (i.e., motor pools,
motorcycles, etc.)

The public should be aware that the
A3M has stated that its purposes for
these disruptions are to discourage
potential buyers for SRI and to gain
sympathy for the movement by inciting
the police to use force.
Y AF Statement
The Stanford Chapter of the Young
Americans for Freedom, along with the
Stanford Community of the Right and
some sympathizers, will be present at
the S.R.I. Hanover Facility at 7:00,
Monday morning, May 19, 1969, in
anticipation of an illegal radical
demonstration. Their activity will be
similar to that of last Friday.
The counter-demonstrators will aid
in the maintenance of order by
discouraging radical activity. They will
photograph illegal actions and obtain
eye-witness reports to document the
same (e.g., damage to private property
and civil rights violations).
