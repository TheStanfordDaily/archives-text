# Police End 2nd People's Park; Guard Maintains Uneasy Order
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Disorders continued in Berkeley over
the weekend as students and street
people confronted police and national
guardsmen in the war over "People's
Park."
Saturday several thousand protestors
massed in the business district to
"disrupt business as usual." They were
dispersed by guardsmen with bayonet
tipped rifles without gunfire, but not
before many businesses closed early and
tear gas was used to clear the streets.
Yesterday activists tried to create a
second "People's Park" but were driven
off by troops with little violence.
The new site was about 10 blocks
north of the first park where a rock

throwing and shooting melee resulted
Thursday after 300 police surrounded
the park in the pre-dawn darkness. After
police ejected the 75 people in the park
an eight-foot cyclone fence was
installed.
Park Surrounded
Sunday guardsmen surrounded 800
persons who had gathered in a vacant
lot at Grove and Hearst Streets. They
were attempting to create a second
community recreational facility. After
warning the demonstrators that their
gathering was illegal, the guard pushed
the protestors off the land and into a
residential area.
The group then marched almost
three miles through Berkeley as their

strength swelled to about 1500 persons.
Police and troops did not attempt to
block or arrest the demonstrators.
About a dozen persons were arrested
Sunday bringing the four day total to
117.
Vigil At Hospital
Earlier in the day, the crowd had
ringed Herrick Hospital where many of
those injured Thursday had been taken.
Their vigil was prompted by reports that
one person injured, James Rector of San
Jose, had died of gunshot wounds.
Hospital administrator Ed Blasdel
assured the protest leaders that Rector
was in fair condition and improving. A
large slug, either from a revolver or part
of a 00 buckshot load had perforated
his stomach and lodged in his liver. His
spleen, one kidney and part of his
intestines were removed at the hospital;
however, the bullet remains in his body.
Over 60 persons have been injured in
the disturbances, 33 by gunfire. Most of
the shooting victims were hit by small
no. 8 shot commonly called birdshot. It
is deadly only at very close range.

Madigan said that officers arriving in

buckshot ammunition was also in the
van and is routinely carried in police
units for use in case their lives are
threatened.
Each buckshot cartridge contains
eight slugs of approximately .32 caliber
each. Such ammunition is capable of
penetrating a car.
It is unclear as to who gave
permission for shotguns to be used on
the crowd, but the San Francisco
Tactical Squad admitted that they had
fired 12 rounds of birdshot Thursday.
2000 Guardsmen
Governor Ronald Reagan ordered
2000 national guard troops into
Berkeley early Friday to reinforce the
police.
The guardsmen, generally young men
with no previous police or military
background, have been fairly friendly to
the protestors.
Guardsmen have been observed
playing guitars and talking with students
and street people as they stand guard on
the street corners. Jeeps and
occasionally entire truckloads will flash
the peace sign as they pass small groups
of demonstrators.
A small newsheet has been
circulating among the guards reportedly
produced by other guardsmen,

refuse to attack or injure their "brothers
and sisters."

A rally has been called for noon
today on the UC Berkeley campus in
defiance of emergency orders which
prohibit such gatherings.
Disorders continued in Berkeley over
the weekend as students and street
people confronted police and national
guardsmen in the war over "People's
Park."
Saturday several thousand protestors
massed in the business district to
"disrupt business as usual." They were
dispersed by guardsmen with bayonet
tipped rifles without gunfire, but not
before many businesses closed early and
tear gas was used to clear the streets.
Yesterday activists tried to create a
second "People's Park" but were driven
off by troops with little violence.
The new site was about 10 blocks
north of the first park where a rock

throwing and shooting melee resulted
Thursday after 300 police surrounded
the park in the pre-dawn darkness. After
police ejected the 75 people in the park
an eight-foot cyclone fence was
installed.
Park Surrounded
Sunday guardsmen surrounded 800
persons who had gathered in a vacant
lot at Grove and Hearst Streets. They
were attempting to create a second
community recreational facility. After
warning the demonstrators that their
gathering was illegal, the guard pushed
the protestors off the land and into a
residential area.
The group then marched almost
three miles through Berkeley as their

strength swelled to about 1500 persons.
Police and troops did not attempt to
block or arrest the demonstrators.
About a dozen persons were arrested
Sunday bringing the four day total to
117.
Vigil At Hospital
Earlier in the day, the crowd had
ringed Herrick Hospital where many of
those injured Thursday had been taken.
Their vigil was prompted by reports that
one person injured, James Rector of San
Jose, had died of gunshot wounds.
Hospital administrator Ed Blasdel
assured the protest leaders that Rector
was in fair condition and improving. A
large slug, either from a revolver or part
of a 00 buckshot load had perforated
his stomach and lodged in his liver. His
spleen, one kidney and part of his
intestines were removed at the hospital;
however, the bullet remains in his body.
Over 60 persons have been injured in
the disturbances, 33 by gunfire. Most of
the shooting victims were hit by small
no. 8 shot commonly called birdshot. It
is deadly only at very close range.
Alameda County Sheriff Frank
Madigan said that officers arriving in
Berkeley were issued birdshot from a
special van. He said however that
buckshot ammunition was also in the
van and is routinely carried in police
units for use in case their lives are
threatened.
Each buckshot cartridge contains
eight slugs of approximately .32 caliber
each. Such ammunition is capable of
penetrating a car.
It is unclear as to who gave
permission for shotguns to be used on
the crowd, but the San Francisco
Tactical Squad admitted that they had
fired 12 rounds of birdshot Thursday.
2000 Guardsmen
Governor Ronald Reagan ordered
2000 national guard troops into
Berkeley early Friday to reinforce the
police.
The guardsmen, generally young men
with no previous police or military
background, have been fairly friendly to
the protestors.
Guardsmen have been observed
playing guitars and talking with students
and street people as they stand guard on
the street corners. Jeeps and
occasionally entire truckloads will flash
the peace sign as they pass small groups
of demonstrators.
A small newsheet has been
circulating among the guards reportedly
produced by other guardsmen,
explaining the issues and asking them to
refuse to attack or injure their "brothers
and sisters."
