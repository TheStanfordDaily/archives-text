# Police End 2nd People's Park; Guard Maintains Uneasy Order
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
Disorders continued in Berkeley over
the weekend as students and street
people confronted police and national
guardsmen in the war over "People's
Park."
Saturday several thousand protestors
massed in the business district to
"disrupt business as usual." They were
dispersed by guardsmen with bayonet
tipped rifles without gunfire, but not
before many businesses closed early and
tear gas was used to clear the streets.
Yesterday activists tried to create a
second "People's Park" but were driven
off by troops with little violence.
The new site was about 10 blocks
north of the first park where a rock

throwing and shooting melee resulted
Thursday after 300 police surrounded
the park in the pre-dawn darkness. After
police ejected the 75 people in the park
an eight-foot cyclone fence was
installed.
Park Surrounded
Sunday guardsmen surrounded 800
persons who had gathered in a vacant
lot at Grove and Hearst Streets. They
were attempting to create a second
community recreational facility. After
warning the demonstrators that their
gathering was illegal, the guard pushed
the protestors off the land and into a
residential area.
The group then marched almost
three miles through Berkeley as their

strength swelled to about 1500 persons.
Police and troops did not attempt to
block or arrest the demonstrators.
About a dozen persons were arrested
Sunday bringing the four day total to
117.
Vigil At Hospital
Earlier in the day, the crowd had
ringed Herrick Hospital where many of
those injured Thursday had been taken.
Their vigil was prompted by reports that
one person injured, James Rector of San
Jose, had died of gunshot wounds.
Hospital administrator Ed Blasdel
assured the protest leaders that Rector
was in fair condition and improving. A
large slug, either from a revolver or part
of a 00 buckshot load had perforated
his stomach and lodged in his liver. His
spleen, one kidney and part of his
intestines were removed at the hospital;
however, the bullet remains in his body.
Over 60 persons have been injured in
the disturbances, 33 by gunfire. Most of
the shooting victims were hit by small
no. 8 shot commonly called birdshot. It
is deadly only at very close range.
Alameda County Sheriff Frank
Madigan said that officers arriving in
Berkeley were issued birdshot from a
special van. He said however that
buckshot ammunition was also in the
