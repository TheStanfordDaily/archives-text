# Frats Try Second Rush
## 
### GREG WHITE 
Twelve Stanford fraternities, faced
with fewer pledges than hoped for after
Winter-Spring Rush, are holding a
special second Rush.
In a letter sent to all freshmen boys
last week, these fraternities announced
the holding of four open-houses. Two of
these have been held, the others are
scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday,
May 20th and 21st, from 7:15 to 9:30.
The participating fraternities are
/ !pha Delta Phi, Alpha Tau Omicron,
Beta Chi, Beta Theta Pi, Chi Psi, Delta
Chi, Delta Kappa Epsiion, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Sigma
Kappa, Theta Chi, and Theta Xi.
Poor A Itendance
So far the second rush is not going
well. Comments by the house rush
chairmen range from "pretty pathetic"
to "I don't think anybody has shown up
at our cluster." Many reasons have been
offered up to explain the poor
attendance by interested freshmen. One
is that freshmen have heard so much
about fraternities being "irrelevant" and
"socially immature" that few take the
trouble to investigate for
themselves—"the freshmen just don't
give us a chance" was a common feeling.
More likely however, is the
possibility that most freshmen are
already pretty well decided on where
they want \<> live next year, or that they
are waiting until the results of the first
draw are announced Tuesday. As one
rush chairman said, "We feel that if a
freshman has to choose between livinß

in a trailer and living in a house, he is
going to chose a fraternity." Most of
those fraternities that entered the
second rush feel a good deal of
competition from the other houses and
the co-ed dorms.
llousing Shortage
According to Jay Voss,
Interfraternitv Council Rush Chairman,
the special rush was decided upon not
only because of the vacancies in the
houses, but because of the University
housing shortage. It was hoped that the
frats could make another effort to get
members and clear spaces in the dorms
for those who wanted to live in a dorm.
It was also felt that an opportunity
should be offered to those freshmen
who hadn't seriously considered
fraternities before.
The houses were almost unanimous
in their criticism of the Winter-Spring
Rush for its timing. While most had
good turnouts ("over 100 showed up,
the biggest pledge crowd in years,")
they felt that scheduling open houses
during dead week and the first week of
Spring quarter kept a lot of interested
freshmen away. Various Rush Chairmen
mentioned the real orientation program
as the best thing about that rush.
Reactions by campus freshmen to
the second rush are varied. One
Wilburite wasn't interested because
"fraternities breed anti-intellectual ism."
Another from Stern was waiting for the
results of the draw, while one Toy on
freshman said, "all they want is my
money."

with fewer pledges than hoped for after
Winter-Spring Rush, are holding a
special second Rush.
In a letter sent to all freshmen boys
last week, these fraternities announced
the holding of four open-houses. Two of
these have been held, the others are
scheduled for Tuesday and Wednesday,
May 20th and 21st, from 7:15 to 9:30.
The participating fraternities are
/ !pha Delta Phi, Alpha Tau Omicron,
Beta Chi, Beta Theta Pi, Chi Psi, Delta
Chi, Delta Kappa Epsiion, Phi Delta
Theta, Phi Gamma Delta, Phi Sigma
Kappa, Theta Chi, and Theta Xi.
Poor A Itendance
So far the second rush is not going
well. Comments by the house rush
chairmen range from "pretty pathetic"
to "I don't think anybody has shown up
at our cluster." Many reasons have been
offered up to explain the poor
attendance by interested freshmen. One
is that freshmen have heard so much
about fraternities being "irrelevant" and
"socially immature" that few take the
trouble to investigate for
themselves—"the freshmen just don't
give us a chance" was a common feeling.
More likely however, is the
possibility that most freshmen are
already pretty well decided on where
they want \<> live next year, or that they
are waiting until the results of the first
draw are announced Tuesday. As one
rush chairman said, "We feel that if a
freshman has to choose between livinß

in a trailer and living in a house, he is
going to chose a fraternity." Most of
those fraternities that entered the
second rush feel a good deal of
competition from the other houses and
the co-ed dorms.
llousing Shortage
According to Jay Voss,
Interfraternitv Council Rush Chairman,
the special rush was decided upon not
only because of the vacancies in the
houses, but because of the University
housing shortage. It was hoped that the
frats could make another effort to get
members and clear spaces in the dorms
for those who wanted to live in a dorm.
It was also felt that an opportunity
should be offered to those freshmen
who hadn't seriously considered
fraternities before.
The houses were almost unanimous
in their criticism of the Winter-Spring
Rush for its timing. While most had
good turnouts ("over 100 showed up,
the biggest pledge crowd in years,")
they felt that scheduling open houses
during dead week and the first week of
Spring quarter kept a lot of interested
freshmen away. Various Rush Chairmen
mentioned the real orientation program
as the best thing about that rush.
Reactions by campus freshmen to
the second rush are varied. One
Wilburite wasn't interested because
"fraternities breed anti-intellectual ism."
Another from Stern was waiting for the
results of the draw, while one Toy on
freshman said, "all they want is my
money."
Twelve Stanford fraternities, faced
with fewer pledges than hoped for after
Winter-Spring Rush, are holding a
