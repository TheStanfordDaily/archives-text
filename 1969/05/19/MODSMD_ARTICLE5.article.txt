# Speaking At Alumni Conference
## Hayes: Restructure Board 
### LYNNE McCALLISTER FELICITY BARRINGER 
Former student body president Denis
Hayes took advantage of Saturday's
Campus Conference to call for the
resignation of 15 members of the
Stanford Board of Trustees.
OveÂ»- 800 alumni, parents, and Bay
Area residents received Hayes'
statement that only a reconstitution of
the Board can save the campus from a
"hurricane" of unrest with long
applause.
Earlier at a Conference luncheon, the
alumni had responded to unscheduled
speech by 10 formally attired, helmeted
members of the April Third Movement,
with a chorus of "boos." Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer addressed the
Conference members at the luncheon.
The Campus Conference was planned
as a series of lectures, tours, films, and
musical and dramatic events for those
interested in seeing the University.
Hayes, at a student panel discussion
of current campus issues, said "The
Stanford Trustees, in making their
unanimous SRI decision, threw away
their last trace of legitimacy in the eyes
of most of the members of the campus
community."
Reconstituted Board
The Board of Trustees which Hayes
proposes would consist of eight of the
present Trustees, five elected alumni
representatives, five individuals chosen
by the Stanford faculty, and five chosen
by the Stanford student body. This
board would then choose eight
"at-large" Trustees, "with an attempt
being made to gain as broad a
cross-section as possible of American
society."
"While a number of the Trustees are
excellent representatives of their
positions," said Hayes, "positions with
which I generally disagree but which I
nonetheless respect, a large number of
Trustees are pompous, silly, or rather
dull elderly people, the sort of
intellectual lightweights which must be

expected in any system of 'government
by crony."
Hayec told the conference that the
only alternative to an attempt by the
Trustees to "rule by bayonet and tear
gas" would be resignation of the
majority of the Trustees. He called for
the resignation of the following
individuals:
Robert Minge Brown, Morris Doyle,
Charles DuCommun, Thomas Jones,
Lawrence Kimpton. Roger Lewis.
Edmund Littlefield, Richard McCurdy,
Fred Merrill, Mrs. Jesse Nichols, Thomas
Pike, William Lister Rogers, Arthur
Stewart, Gardiner Symonds, and Dean
Watkins.
Remaining Trustees
The remaining members would be
Ernest Arbuckle, Mrs. Alan Charles, Ben
Duniway, W. Parmer Fuller, 111, John
Gardner, Richard Guggenhime, and
William Hewlett, and whomever is
selected to replace David Packard.
Afterwards, 60 alumni signed a
statement in support of his proposal. An
effort is now being made to circulate
this proposal to all alumni.

During lunch time ceremonies in the
courtyard of Bowman Alumni House,
about ten of the April Third
Movement from the Newton-Seale
Affinity group staged a surprise piece of
"guerilla theater."
A3M Statement
The group, in suits and dresses, lined
up in front of the podium where Pitzer
was introducing the first speaker. Janet
Weiss, after calmly lifting down the
microphone, read the following
statement:
"We are your sons and daughters,
your brothers and sisters, the cream of
America's crop.
"We are the people you warned us
about.
"We stand here today to accuse
Stanford and America of hypocrisy.
"The University teaches us world
brotherhood and democracy. What is
practiced is war research and elitism.
"We have take a stand. We have said
'no' to hypocrisy, and, and we have been
gassed and clubbed.
"Stand with us against hypocrisy."
