SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—The Apollo 10 astronauts,
launched flawlessly toward the moon
Sunday, transmitted brilliant color
television pictures of their home planet
shrinking behind them as they sped
outward in a dress rehearsal of a lunar
landing mission.
Air Force Col. Thomas P. Stafford
and Navy Cmdrs. John W. Young and
Eugene A. Cernan, jubilant at the
successful first day of their moon
voyage, shared their view of earth in
two unplanned television space shows.

Pointing the camera out a window as
their spaceship sped toward the moon at
more than 20,000 miles an hour, the
astronauts beamed to earth its first
color portrait from 23,000 miles and
then from more than 35,000 miles out
in space.
"Just for the record," Cernan said of
his view of earth, "it looks to me like a
pretty nice place to live."
In both of the unscheduled
transmissions, the earth stood out as a
blue, brown and white-streaked ball
floating on a cold, black background.
"How's the color coming through
down there," Stafford asked at one
point.
"Beau tiful"„
"Oh, beautiful," said mission
control. "The oceans arc? a beautiful
blue green. We can see the land masses
in a brown to reddish brown."
Stafford, holding the camera, then
switched to views inside the spacecraft.
He showed Young and Cernan at
their cramped spaceship work stations.
Cernan held up a flight plan and the
picture was clear enough to easily read
words on the document.
Someone else took the camera and
focused on Stafford. The Apollo 10
commander was casually chewing gum.
All three were still wearing the heavy
white space suits they donned hours
before in Florida just before their
launch.
Earlier, in the scheduled portion of
the more than 60 minutes of television
from space Sunday, the Apollo 10 crew
let the world watch while they docked
with the lunar lander.
Module Separates
As the television camera beamed its
first signal to earth, Young deftly
separated the command module, turned
it around and poked the nose of the
