# Apollo 10 Shot Has Perfect Launch

SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—The Apollo 10 astronauts,
launched flawlessly toward the moon
Sunday, transmitted brilliant color
television pictures of their home planet
shrinking behind them as they sped
outward in a dress rehearsal of a lunar
landing mission.
Air Force Col. Thomas P. Stafford
and Navy Cmdrs. John W. Young and
Eugene A. Cernan, jubilant at the
successful first day of their moon
voyage, shared their view of earth in
two unplanned television space shows.

Pointing the camera out a window as
their spaceship sped toward the moon at
more than 20,000 miles an hour, the
astronauts beamed to earth its first
color portrait from 23,000 miles and
then from more than 35,000 miles out
in space.
"Just for the record," Cernan said of
his view of earth, "it looks to me like a
pretty nice place to live."
In both of the unscheduled
transmissions, the earth stood out as a
blue, brown and white-streaked ball
floating on a cold, black background.
"How's the color coming through
down there," Stafford asked at one
point.
"Beau tiful"„
"Oh, beautiful," said mission
control. "The oceans arc? a beautiful
blue green. We can see the land masses
in a brown to reddish brown."
Stafford, holding the camera, then
switched to views inside the spacecraft.
He showed Young and Cernan at
their cramped spaceship work stations.
Cernan held up a flight plan and the
picture was clear enough to easily read
words on the document.
Someone else took the camera and
focused on Stafford. The Apollo 10
commander was casually chewing gum.
All three were still wearing the heavy
white space suits they donned hours
before in Florida just before their
launch.
Earlier, in the scheduled portion of
the more than 60 minutes of television
from space Sunday, the Apollo 10 crew

Earlier, in the scheduled portion of

let the world watch while they docked
with the lunar lander.
Module Separates
As the television camera beamed its
first signal to earth, Young deftly
separated the command module, turned
it around and poked the nose of the
cone-shaped spaceship into the docking
collar of the lunar lander.
The module was still nested atop the
third stage booster rocket, called the
S4B. A few minutes after docking, the
command module and the lunar
module, linked together, were spring
ejected from the S4B.
The Astronauts maneuvered their
spaceship into a safe position, then

focused their camera on the S4B. At a
signal from the ground, the discarded
rocket's engines came to life. The S4B
streaked out of sight into solar orbit.
Apollo 10 was launched into orbit
precisely on time, 12:49 am EDT,
from the space complex at Cape
Kennedy.
The 365-foot spacecraft stack, with
the command module just a small
pimple on top stood motionless for nine
seconds while the rocket engines burned
up to full power.
Slowly the spacecraft lifted its
3,000-ton weight, straining into the
cloudy sky, then turned southeast and
disappeared into space.
"What a ride!" said Cernan excitedly,
"what a ride!" Then later, Cernan
almost shouted: "It's beautiful out
there. Fantastic, man, really fantastic.
Man, this is the greatest."
Apollo 10 circled the earth for
almost two orbits before the crew
ignited the powerful S4B rocket engine
and roared farther into space, toward
the moon a quarter million miles away.

Apollo 10 circled the earth for
almost two orbits before the crew
ignited the powerful S4B rocket engine
and roared farther into space, toward
the moon a quarter million miles away.
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—The Apollo 10 astronauts,
launched flawlessly toward the moon
Sunday, transmitted brilliant color
television pictures of their home planet
shrinking behind them as they sped
outward in a dress rehearsal of a lunar
landing mission.
Air Force Col. Thomas P. Stafford
and Navy Cmdrs. John W. Young and
Eugene A. Cernan, jubilant at the
successful first day of their moon
voyage, shared their view of earth in
two unplanned television space shows.

Pointing the camera out a window as
their spaceship sped toward the moon at
more than 20,000 miles an hour, the
astronauts beamed to earth its first
color portrait from 23,000 miles and
then from more than 35,000 miles out
in space.
"Just for the record," Cernan said of
his view of earth, "it looks to me like a
pretty nice place to live."
In both of the unscheduled
transmissions, the earth stood out as a
blue, brown and white-streaked ball
floating on a cold, black background.
"How's the color coming through
down there," Stafford asked at one
point.
"Beau tiful"„
"Oh, beautiful," said mission
control. "The oceans arc? a beautiful
blue green. We can see the land masses
in a brown to reddish brown."
Stafford, holding the camera, then
switched to views inside the spacecraft.
He showed Young and Cernan at
their cramped spaceship work stations.
Cernan held up a flight plan and the
picture was clear enough to easily read
words on the document.
Someone else took the camera and
focused on Stafford. The Apollo 10
commander was casually chewing gum.
All three were still wearing the heavy
white space suits they donned hours
before in Florida just before their
launch.
Earlier, in the scheduled portion of
the more than 60 minutes of television
from space Sunday, the Apollo 10 crew
let the world watch while they docked
with the lunar lander.
Module Separates
As the television camera beamed its
first signal to earth, Young deftly
separated the command module, turned
it around and poked the nose of the
cone-shaped spaceship into the docking
collar of the lunar lander.
The module was still nested atop the
third stage booster rocket, called the
S4B. A few minutes after docking, the
command module and the lunar
module, linked together, were spring
ejected from the S4B.
The Astronauts maneuvered their
spaceship into a safe position, then

focused their camera on the S4B. At a
signal from the ground, the discarded
rocket's engines came to life. The S4B
streaked out of sight into solar orbit.
Apollo 10 was launched into orbit
precisely on time, 12:49 am EDT,
from the space complex at Cape
Kennedy.
The 365-foot spacecraft stack, with
the command module just a small
pimple on top stood motionless for nine
seconds while the rocket engines burned
up to full power.
Slowly the spacecraft lifted its
3,000-ton weight, straining into the
cloudy sky, then turned southeast and
disappeared into space.
"What a ride!" said Cernan excitedly,
"what a ride!" Then later, Cernan
almost shouted: "It's beautiful out
there. Fantastic, man, really fantastic.
Man, this is the greatest."
