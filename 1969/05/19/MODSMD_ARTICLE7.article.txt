# Mrs. Romney: ‘No' To Free Love
## 'U.S. Needs Traditional Morals' 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
"The new morality should be a sense
of earing in a committed way." declared
Lenore Romney in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Friday.
Taking part in a panel discussion
sponsored by two campus Republican
organizations, Mrs. Romney, wife of the
Secretary of Housing and Urhan
Development, entitled her remarks,
"Beyond the New Morality: A
discussion of the Spiritual Crisis in
America Today."
"Freedom," Mrs. Romney stated,
"isn't the liberty to be licentious."
"If there are standards which give
each person the right to do anything he
wants for himself," she continued,
"then there will be no mores upon
which to hase this society."
"Our society has integrity only as

long as the individual has integrity."
Discussing a base for American
society, Mrs. Romney stressed the
necessity of the family and insisted,
"Civilization will do downhill without
strong family units."
Sex Object
She further emphasized the
disadvantages of promiscuity.
"If you have many loves," she
explained, "you become a sex object
instead of a sex being."
"As a woman understands her
husband—her sweetheart—so she gains
complete fulfillment."
"Love runs into commitment and
loyality; there is no security in youth
and beauty," she warned. "If women
are only ting-a-ling things, then there's
always someone with more ting-a-ling
down the street."
"If you're promiscuous, you get no

satisfaction and happiness," Mrs.
Romney warned.
"In order for a woman to be
fulfilled, she has to know she's first,"
she added. "Full joy is not possible if
you are always seeking."
"Don't throw away the most
maunificent relationship on earth," she
said, "on someone who doesn't care.
That relationship is worth any amount
of self-discipline."
R ai.se Standards
An advocate of social equality for
women, Mrs. Romney told the women
in the audience, "You girls often try to
gain equality by doing all the low things
that men do—take drugs, smoke, drink,
whatever—instead of raising the
standards of men to your level and
proving to them that women have the
better way.

"Instead of gaining equality, you're
giving up the essence of womanhood."
In the course of the talk, Mrs.
Romney praised her own marriage and
the importance of "knowing that you're
first in his life."
"If the parents are committed to
each other, then the kids are all right,"
she said later on. After her talk, Mrs.
Romney's daughter joined her on stage
to help answer audience questions.
In Lead Wagon
Specifically adressing the youth of
America, Mrs. Romney warned, "You as
students are in the lead wagon in this
society. But you have to take the past
and build on it, or you will be
destroying the very thing that you
want."
"If you destroy our universities, you
will be destroying a lot of the technical
expertise of this country." Her advice
was to stay in college "to gain
knowledge as tools with which to
change the system."
The repeatedly emphasized that the
younger generation has to "learn from
the past."
"But why point to the bad things
that adults do and say 'if you can do
them, why can't we?"
"Why not say, 'We're going to build a
better world,' and make one that you
do like."

She pointed out that in America"the
government lets the people decide for
themselves what's morally right." She
nevertheless warned that "everyone
should follow guidelines from God . .
Take Moral S land
"The only way this country is going
to be cleaned up is if each individual
takes a moral stand to clean up his life
and together we can change the
country."
Ending on a hopeful note, however,
Mrs. Romney prophecized, "We're on
the frontiers of beauty and
commitment . . .The day is coming
when other nations will look to us and
say, 'America can be trusted because of
the integrity of the home and the
magnificence of her youth."

change the system."
The repeatedly emphasized that the
younger generation has to "learn from
the past."
"But why point to the bad things
that adults do and say 'if you can do
them, why can't we?"
"Why not say, 'We're going to build a
better world,' and make one that you
do like."

She pointed out that in America"the
government lets the people decide for
themselves what's morally right." She
nevertheless warned that "everyone
should follow guidelines from God . .
Take Moral S land
"The only way this country is going
to be cleaned up is if each individual
takes a moral stand to clean up his life
and together we can change the
country."
Ending on a hopeful note, however,
Mrs. Romney prophecized, "We're on
the frontiers of beauty and
commitment . . .The day is coming
when other nations will look to us and
say, 'America can be trusted because of
the integrity of the home and the
magnificence of her youth."
"The new morality should be a sense
of earing in a committed way." declared
Lenore Romney in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Friday.
Taking part in a panel discussion
sponsored by two campus Republican
organizations, Mrs. Romney, wife of the
Secretary of Housing and Urhan
Development, entitled her remarks,
"Beyond the New Morality: A
discussion of the Spiritual Crisis in
America Today."
"Freedom," Mrs. Romney stated,
"isn't the liberty to be licentious."
"If there are standards which give
each person the right to do anything he
wants for himself," she continued,
"then there will be no mores upon
which to hase this society."
"Our society has integrity only as

long as the individual has integrity."
Discussing a base for American
society, Mrs. Romney stressed the
necessity of the family and insisted,
"Civilization will do downhill without
strong family units."
Sex Object
She further emphasized the
disadvantages of promiscuity.
"If you have many loves," she
explained, "you become a sex object
instead of a sex being."
"As a woman understands her
husband—her sweetheart—so she gains
complete fulfillment."
"Love runs into commitment and
loyality; there is no security in youth
and beauty," she warned. "If women
are only ting-a-ling things, then there's
always someone with more ting-a-ling
down the street."
"If you're promiscuous, you get no

satisfaction and happiness," Mrs.
Romney warned.
"In order for a woman to be
fulfilled, she has to know she's first,"
she added. "Full joy is not possible if
you are always seeking."
"Don't throw away the most
maunificent relationship on earth," she
said, "on someone who doesn't care.
That relationship is worth any amount
of self-discipline."
R ai.se Standards
An advocate of social equality for
women, Mrs. Romney told the women
in the audience, "You girls often try to
gain equality by doing all the low things
that men do—take drugs, smoke, drink,
whatever—instead of raising the
standards of men to your level and
proving to them that women have the
better way.
"Instead of gaining equality, you're
giving up the essence of womanhood."
In the course of the talk, Mrs.
Romney praised her own marriage and
the importance of "knowing that you're
first in his life."
"If the parents are committed to
each other, then the kids are all right,"
she said later on. After her talk, Mrs.
Romney's daughter joined her on stage
to help answer audience questions.
In Lead Wagon
Specifically adressing the youth of
America, Mrs. Romney warned, "You as
students are in the lead wagon in this
society. But you have to take the past
and build on it, or you will be
destroying the very thing that you
want."
"If you destroy our universities, you
will be destroying a lot of the technical
expertise of this country." Her advice
was to stay in college "to gain
knowledge as tools with which to
change the system."
The repeatedly emphasized that the
younger generation has to "learn from
the past."
"But why point to the bad things
