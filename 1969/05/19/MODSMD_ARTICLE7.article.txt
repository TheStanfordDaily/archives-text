# Mrs. Romney: ‘No' To Free Love
## 'U.S. Needs Traditional Morals' 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
"The new morality should be a sense
of earing in a committed way." declared
Lenore Romney in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium last Friday.
Taking part in a panel discussion
sponsored by two campus Republican
organizations, Mrs. Romney, wife of the
Secretary of Housing and Urhan
Development, entitled her remarks,
"Beyond the New Morality: A
discussion of the Spiritual Crisis in
America Today."
"Freedom," Mrs. Romney stated,
"isn't the liberty to be licentious."
"If there are standards which give
each person the right to do anything he
wants for himself," she continued,
"then there will be no mores upon
which to hase this society."
"Our society has integrity only as

long as the individual has integrity."
Discussing a base for American
society, Mrs. Romney stressed the
necessity of the family and insisted,
"Civilization will do downhill without
strong family units."
Sex Object
She further emphasized the
disadvantages of promiscuity.
"If you have many loves," she
explained, "you become a sex object
instead of a sex being."
"As a woman understands her
husband—her sweetheart—so she gains
complete fulfillment."
"Love runs into commitment and
loyality; there is no security in youth
and beauty," she warned. "If women
are only ting-a-ling things, then there's
always someone with more ting-a-ling
down the street."
"If you're promiscuous, you get no

satisfaction and happiness," Mrs.
Romney warned.
"In order for a woman to be
fulfilled, she has to know she's first,"
she added. "Full joy is not possible if
you are always seeking."
"Don't throw away the most
maunificent relationship on earth," she
said, "on someone who doesn't care.
That relationship is worth any amount
of self-discipline."
R ai.se Standards
An advocate of social equality for
women, Mrs. Romney told the women
in the audience, "You girls often try to
gain equality by doing all the low things
that men do—take drugs, smoke, drink,
whatever—instead of raising the
standards of men to your level and
proving to them that women have the
better way.
