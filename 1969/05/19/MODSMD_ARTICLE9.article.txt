# Wake Up
## 
### 
The Board of Trustees has thrown away
its last trace of legitimacy.
We and much of the Stanford
community have found its response to the
issue of SRI totally unacceptable. Because
of this, 1 the Board itself, its structure and its
role, promises to be the major issue of the
coming year.
Presently the Board consists of 14
corporate businessmen, three lawyers, two
women, one judge, one doctor, and one
chairman of an Urban Coalition. All are
white, all are rich. The average age is 57.
Hardly representative of society.
Apparently the Board realized its
disproportionate representation and in an
attempt to improve the situation appointed
a committee headed by John Gardner to
propose reforms.
It seems, however, that the Board has
not learned from past mistakes: all five
members of Gardner's committee are
Trustees. Since the Board has shown itself
entirely unresponsive in the past, we have
little reason to believe that it will take into
account the wishes of the Stanford
community in restructuring itself.
We have no reason to believe that open
hearings by the present committee to
solicit opinions will be any more effective
than the SRI hearing. We feel that
committees similar to that of Gardner's,
with one composed of students and one of
faculty—even if equal in size and
influence—would defeat the idea behind
reform, the idea of working together.

Separate but equal committees would only
breed further distrust.
We therefore urge the Board of Trustees
to accord equal representation and voting
privileges to all constituencies of the
Stanford community, and that the
representatives be incorporated into the
Gardner committee. Hopefully, equal
representation will provide urgently needed
reform.
On Saturday Denis Hayes called for the
resignation of 15 present members of the
Stanford Board of Trustees, asking the
individuals to form the Stanford Cabinet,
an independent finance group. Five alumni
chosen by the alumni, five individuals
chosen by the Stanford faculty, and five
individuals chosen by the Stanford student
body would replace those resigning.
We recognize Denis Hayes' proposal as
one possible manner of reform and
commend him for focusing the attention of
many members of the community on this
issue. We urge others to work out different
plans and make them known publicly. The
Daily will print letters and columns on the
subject.
By early fall meaningful, comprehensive
reform can be implemented. If it is not, if
student and faculty views are again rejected
by the Trustees, then, as Denis Hayes
stated, the left will again be correct in
saying, 'this liberal communication gap is
bullshit . . .We told you so.' . . .And the
probability of more serious confrontations
in the future is very great.
Wake up, Trustees.
