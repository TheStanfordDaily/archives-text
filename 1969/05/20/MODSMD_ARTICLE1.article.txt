# Trailer Design Unveiled
## Draw Results Postponed 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Housing draw results will not be
released today as originally planned.
Instead, students already in the draw
will be able to amend their choices this
week to include the new trailers,
approved by the Trustees last week.
The trailer village will be erected east
of Branner Hall on a vacant lot bordered
by Campus Drive and Escondido Road.
According to Assistant Dean of
Students Sally Mahoney, 472 students
and 8 faculty members will be housed in
120 units there.
The additional trailer housing will
assure everyone now in campus housing
of a space next year. Extra spaces will

be divided between transfer students
and foreign graduate students.
Each trailer contains three furnished
bedrooms, living room, dining alcove,
kitchen, one full bathroom, and a
bathroom with shower only. One unit
will house four students. Rent is $66.33
per person per month—the same rate as
that for single students in Escondido
Village.
Information Meeting Tonight
Trailers will be placed in groups of
four around courtyards. The entire field
will be landscaped, and a central
congregating area set off for basketball
and volleyball courts and laundry and
lounge facilities.

Miss Mahoney will hold an
informational meeting this evening at
7:30 in Tresidder Union to explain the
trailer option. Students who decide to
include the trailers in their choices may
do so Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
in the registrar's office.
First round draw results will then be
released next Wednesday. Round two of
the draw involving final acceptance of
assignments will be completed during
the first week of June.
Dean Mahoney explained that
because compatibility is a major factor
in this apartment type housing groups
of three or four students must draw
together. All members of the group
must be present to amend their draw
choices unless intention is confirmed in
a written statement. Groups will be
given the best draw number of the
student involved.
Permanent Housing Later
Arrangements may also be made to
place groups of four facing the same
courtyard.
Because students may amend their
draw choices this week, foreign and
transfer students will not be
concentrated in the trailers. Groups of
three in the trailers will be joined by a
foreign or transfer student of similar
interests, such as the same major.
Dean Mahoney expects the trailers
will be retained for three to five years,
until permanent housing replaces them.
The University did not want to rush
into allowing a private contractor to
construct housing this year which might
not fit needs in a few years, she said.
The trailers now located on
Salvatierra Street will be phased out
next year, Miss Mahoney added.
Students who had listed these trailers as
a draw choice may also change their
draw cards this week.

congregating area set off for basketball
and volleyball courts and laundry and
lounge facilities.

Miss Mahoney will hold an
informational meeting this evening at
7:30 in Tresidder Union to explain the
trailer option. Students who decide to
include the trailers in their choices may
do so Wednesday, Thursday and Friday
in the registrar's office.
First round draw results will then be
released next Wednesday. Round two of
the draw involving final acceptance of
assignments will be completed during
the first week of June.
Dean Mahoney explained that
because compatibility is a major factor
in this apartment type housing groups
of three or four students must draw
together. All members of the group
must be present to amend their draw
choices unless intention is confirmed in
a written statement. Groups will be
given the best draw number of the
student involved.
Permanent Housing Later
Arrangements may also be made to
place groups of four facing the same
courtyard.
Because students may amend their
draw choices this week, foreign and
transfer students will not be
concentrated in the trailers. Groups of
three in the trailers will be joined by a
foreign or transfer student of similar
interests, such as the same major.
Dean Mahoney expects the trailers
will be retained for three to five years,
until permanent housing replaces them.
The University did not want to rush
into allowing a private contractor to
construct housing this year which might
not fit needs in a few years, she said.
The trailers now located on
Salvatierra Street will be phased out
next year, Miss Mahoney added.
Students who had listed these trailers as
a draw choice may also change their
draw cards this week.


NEW MOUSING—The University released yesterday the plans for the 120 trailer units which
will be built in the lot next to Brainier Mali.
Housing draw results will not be
released today as originally planned.
Instead, students already in the draw
will be able to amend their choices this
week to include the new trailers,
approved by the Trustees last week.
The trailer village will be erected east
of Branner Hall on a vacant lot bordered
by Campus Drive and Escondido Road.
According to Assistant Dean of
Students Sally Mahoney, 472 students
and 8 faculty members will be housed in
120 units there.
The additional trailer housing will
assure everyone now in campus housing
of a space next year. Extra spaces will

be divided between transfer students
and foreign graduate students.
Each trailer contains three furnished
bedrooms, living room, dining alcove,
kitchen, one full bathroom, and a
bathroom with shower only. One unit
will house four students. Rent is $66.33
per person per month—the same rate as
that for single students in Escondido
Village.
Information Meeting Tonight
Trailers will be placed in groups of
four around courtyards. The entire field
will be landscaped, and a central
congregating area set off for basketball
and volleyball courts and laundry and
lounge facilities.
