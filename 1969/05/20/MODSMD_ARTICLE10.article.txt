## Question of Effectiveness 
### Michael Sweeney 
Many people have probably
closed their minds to the April
3rd Movement since the
demonstrations moved into the
street. Barricades, helmets, tear
gas and broken windows are
intrinsically associated with riots.
And riots are assumed to be
unreasoned, purely destructive
acts of hatred.
However strong those
destructive associations, they
should not be allowed to
dominate the thinking.,of anyone
who still wants to understand how
our entrenched society can be
reformed.
To begin with, it should be
noted that the same people who
have been passing resolutions.

signing petitions, and writing
letters to Trustees—all respectable
forms of protest—are now out on
the street in helmets and masks
trying to block SRI research with
their bodies. All of those people
learned something in the past two
months about their own
commitment to social and
political reform. And all of them
learned that something more than
a petition is needed.
Any erstwhile April 3rd
sympathizer who is not in the
streets, in fact, should feel quite
impotent by now.
All the concern and debate
that the Stanford faculty and
students invested in SRI was
largely negated by the blunt
Trustee decision to sever SRI
without a convenant. Large
majorities of both faculty and
students had voted that the
various kinds of SRI war research
are "unacceptable." Students also
voted in favor of keeping SRI.
The faculty senate decided that
further study was needed and no
final decision should be made
until Autumn. Even the
administration was reported to
have asked for a delay.
But the Trustees spurned all
advice. It was a classic lesson in
the reality of power. They got it,
we don't. Yet.

The outraged liberals—ASSU
Presidents and a group of
faculty—who responded to the
Trustees by denouncing their
legitimacy should also feel quite
impotent. They will have small
success, alone, in persuading John
Gardner's committee of five
trustees that most of the present
board shoulds be replaced and
stripped of powers.
Notably, the April 3rd
Movement did not bother to pass
any resolutions about the
Trustees. Instead the Movement
prepared to close down SRl's
counterinsurgency offices at
Hanover street. In the liberals'
eyes, the street disruption was a
monstrous violation of the rule of
law, without which man shall sink
into barbarism. The Movement,
which seems to be a good deal
more sensitive to contemporary
barbarism than the liberals, went
ahead with the exhausting and
dangerous work of harrassing a
superior power.
The Movement has put forth
a carefully reasoned explanation
of the disruption. The key goal
has always been to stop SRl's
counterinsurgency and war-related
research. Since this is now not
likely to be done through

retention of SRI by the
University, it must be done by
creating an unpleasant atmosphere
around SRI that will scare off
government project sponsors and
any potential industrial buyers. As
the intent of their May 13
severance decision is negated, the
Trustees will themselves begin to
realize that a quiet resignation
from the Board may save them
much grief.
I believe the Movement is
succeeding. But don't take my
word for it. Charles Anderson,
SRI President, much in a
sworn declaration in support of
the recent injunction:
''If the acts of the
defendants (April 3rd Movement
and others) in disrupting
plaintiff's business as they did on
May 16, 1969 are repeated, it will
be impossible to estimate the
monetary damages caused to
plaintiff. Certainly, great and
irreparable damage will be caused
through loss of many, many
man-hours of productive time . . .

Any erstwhile April 3rd
sympathizer who is not in the
streets, in fact, should feel quite
impotent by now.
All the concern and debate
that the Stanford faculty and
students invested in SRI was
largely negated by the blunt
Trustee decision to sever SRI
without a convenant. Large
majorities of both faculty and
students had voted that the
various kinds of SRI war research
are "unacceptable." Students also
voted in favor of keeping SRI.
The faculty senate decided that
further study was needed and no
final decision should be made
until Autumn. Even the
administration was reported to
have asked for a delay.
But the Trustees spurned all
advice. It was a classic lesson in
the reality of power. They got it,
we don't. Yet.

The outraged liberals—ASSU
Presidents and a group of
faculty—who responded to the
Trustees by denouncing their
legitimacy should also feel quite
impotent. They will have small
success, alone, in persuading John
Gardner's committee of five
trustees that most of the present
board shoulds be replaced and
stripped of powers.
Notably, the April 3rd
Movement did not bother to pass
any resolutions about the
Trustees. Instead the Movement
prepared to close down SRl's
counterinsurgency offices at
Hanover street. In the liberals'
eyes, the street disruption was a
monstrous violation of the rule of
law, without which man shall sink
into barbarism. The Movement,
which seems to be a good deal
more sensitive to contemporary
barbarism than the liberals, went
ahead with the exhausting and
dangerous work of harrassing a
superior power.
The Movement has put forth
a carefully reasoned explanation
of the disruption. The key goal
has always been to stop SRl's
counterinsurgency and war-related
research. Since this is now not
likely to be done through

retention of SRI by the
University, it must be done by
creating an unpleasant atmosphere
around SRI that will scare off
government project sponsors and
any potential industrial buyers. As
the intent of their May 13
severance decision is negated, the
Trustees will themselves begin to
realize that a quiet resignation
from the Board may save them
much grief.
I believe the Movement is
succeeding. But don't take my
word for it. Charles Anderson,
SRI President, much in a
sworn declaration in support of
the recent injunction:
''If the acts of the
defendants (April 3rd Movement
and others) in disrupting
plaintiff's business as they did on
May 16, 1969 are repeated, it will
be impossible to estimate the
monetary damages caused to
plaintiff. Certainly, great and
irreparable damage will be caused
through loss of many, many
man-hours of productive time . . .

Many people have probably
closed their minds to the April
3rd Movement since the
demonstrations moved into the
street. Barricades, helmets, tear
gas and broken windows are
intrinsically associated with riots.
And riots are assumed to be
unreasoned, purely destructive
acts of hatred.
However strong those
destructive associations, they
should not be allowed to
dominate the thinking.,of anyone
who still wants to understand how
our entrenched society can be
reformed.
To begin with, it should be
noted that the same people who
have been passing resolutions.

signing petitions, and writing
letters to Trustees—all respectable
forms of protest—are now out on
the street in helmets and masks
trying to block SRI research with
their bodies. All of those people
learned something in the past two
months about their own
commitment to social and
political reform. And all of them
learned that something more than
a petition is needed.
