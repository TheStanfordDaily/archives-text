## In Defense Of Abe Fortas As Jurist 
### 
Edward Koplowitz

Tom San ford's recent article,
"What Allowed Fortas' Rise," is a
disheartening example of
editorializing based too much on
emotion and too little on fact. If
Mr. Sanford had confined himself
to commenting on the alleged
inpropriety of Justice Fortas'
accepting money on behalf of the
Woolfson Foundation, there could
have been little quarrel with his
opinion. His remarks on Fortas'
supposedly murky past, however,
reveal a profound lack of
knowledge—and candor.
The answer to Mr. Sanford's
question, "What Allowed Fortas'
Rise," is simple: outstanding
competence in his chosen field.
Contrary to Mr. Sanford's
allegations, Justice Fortas' past
was an impressive one, and one
easily discovered, had Mr. Sanford
only taken the time to look up
the facts.
In brief, Justice Fortas was
graduated from the Yale Law
School in 1933, having served as
editor in chief of the Yale Law
Journal. Fortas then taught law at
Yale from 1933 to 1937, held
various legal positions in the
government from 1937 to 1941,
and served as Director of the
Division of Power of the

Department of the Interior in
1941-1942. Fortas was appointed
Undersecretary of the Department
in 1942, serving in that capacity
until 1946, whereupon he
associated with the now-famous
law firm of (Thurman) Arnold,
Fortas and (Paul) Porter.
Respected
It was as a senior partner with
Arnold, Fortas and Porter that
Justice Fortas established his
place as one of the ablest lawyers
and most respected appellate
advocates in America. A confidant
of Lyndon Johnson, Pablo Casals
and a host of influential American
business leaders, it was Fortas
who was requested by the
Supreme Court in 1962 to
represent one Clarence Gideon in
his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The result was a landmark case
holding a requirement of
representation by counsel for
indigents in all criminal felony
cases: Gideon v. Wainwright.
(Justice Fortas' role in this case is
ably described by Anthony Lewis
in his interesting Gideon's
Trumpet.)
While nothing in Fortas'
background fully explains his
connection with the Woolfson
Foundation, it is nonetheless an

extraordinary extrapolation to
draw from his actions the
conclusion that Fortas is a "super
monster" (Mr. Watson's words).
Monumental? Really, Mr.
Sanford, only a complete naivete
concerning recent American
political and legal history could
result in conclusions you have
drawn.
If the principles of morality

expressed by Mr. Sanford are
truly universal, is then Justice
Douglas a "super monster" for
receiving $12,765 annually from
the Parvin Foundation for services
rendered? We are told that Fortas'
actions cast suspicions on the
man —former President
Johnson—who appointed him.
does this likewise hold for the
man —President Roosevelt—who

appointed -Fortas Undersecretary
of the Interior?
Your concern, Mr. Sanford, is
admirable, but I am sure you can
find many men more worthy of
scorn that Justice Fortas. Even in
Arizona.

Yale from 1933 to 1937, held
various legal positions in the
government from 1937 to 1941,
and served as Director of the
Division of Power of the

Department of the Interior in
1941-1942. Fortas was appointed
Undersecretary of the Department
in 1942, serving in that capacity
until 1946, whereupon he
associated with the now-famous
law firm of (Thurman) Arnold,
Fortas and (Paul) Porter.
Respected
It was as a senior partner with
Arnold, Fortas and Porter that
Justice Fortas established his
place as one of the ablest lawyers
and most respected appellate
advocates in America. A confidant
of Lyndon Johnson, Pablo Casals
and a host of influential American
business leaders, it was Fortas
who was requested by the
Supreme Court in 1962 to
represent one Clarence Gideon in
his appeal to the Supreme Court.
The result was a landmark case
holding a requirement of
representation by counsel for
indigents in all criminal felony
cases: Gideon v. Wainwright.
(Justice Fortas' role in this case is
ably described by Anthony Lewis
in his interesting Gideon's
Trumpet.)
While nothing in Fortas'
background fully explains his
connection with the Woolfson
Foundation, it is nonetheless an

extraordinary extrapolation to
draw from his actions the
conclusion that Fortas is a "super
monster" (Mr. Watson's words).
Monumental? Really, Mr.
Sanford, only a complete naivete
concerning recent American
political and legal history could
result in conclusions you have
drawn.
If the principles of morality

expressed by Mr. Sanford are
truly universal, is then Justice
Douglas a "super monster" for
receiving $12,765 annually from
the Parvin Foundation for services
rendered? We are told that Fortas'
actions cast suspicions on the
man —former President
Johnson—who appointed him.
does this likewise hold for the
man —President Roosevelt—who

appointed -Fortas Undersecretary
of the Interior?
Your concern, Mr. Sanford, is
admirable, but I am sure you can
find many men more worthy of
scorn that Justice Fortas. Even in
Arizona.

Tom San ford's recent article,
"What Allowed Fortas' Rise," is a
disheartening example of
editorializing based too much on
emotion and too little on fact. If
Mr. Sanford had confined himself
to commenting on the alleged
inpropriety of Justice Fortas'
accepting money on behalf of the
Woolfson Foundation, there could
have been little quarrel with his
opinion. His remarks on Fortas'
supposedly murky past, however,
reveal a profound lack of
knowledge—and candor.
The answer to Mr. Sanford's
question, "What Allowed Fortas'
Rise," is simple: outstanding
competence in his chosen field.
Contrary to Mr. Sanford's
allegations, Justice Fortas' past
was an impressive one, and one
easily discovered, had Mr. Sanford
only taken the time to look up
the facts.
In brief, Justice Fortas was
graduated from the Yale Law
School in 1933, having served as
editor in chief of the Yale Law
Journal. Fortas then taught law at
