# O'Neill Classic Heads This Week's Film List
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Great films from the United
States, Sweden and India are the
screen highlights of the coming
week.
Sidney Lumet's film version of
Long Day's Journey Into Night
skillfully condenses the action of
Eugene O'Neill's manuscript from
four to three hours and leaves the
power and agony of the original
intact. The autobiographical play
marked the apex of O'Neill's
career and, for once, one of his
dramas found artists worthy of
the task of adapting it for the
screen. Katharine Hepburn, Sir
Ralph Richardson, Jason Robards
and Dean Stockwell won an
ensemble acting award at the
Cannes Film Festival; Hepburn
here is beyong criticism but
Robards' performance, in
particular, stands out as one of
the greatest ever recorded on
celluloid. This Western Civ film
will be shown on Tuesday and
Wednesday at 4:15 and 7:30 in
Cubberley.
Just as Clive Miller arrives in
the Orient, Walk Don't Run, a
pleasant romantic comedy set
during the 1964 Tokyo summer
Olympics, will be screened at the
continuation of his film series in
Geology 320 on Tuesday at 8 and
10:15. Gary Grant and Jim Jutton
are the two rogues competing for
the attention of Samantha Eggar.
In color, with music by Quincy
Jones.
(Jandide is an up-dated version
of the Voltaire classic with the
versatile Jean-Pierre Cassel in the
title role and Dahlia Lavi as

Cunegonde. There is not so much
philosophy in this 1963 French
production as witty, modern
satire. This I-Center film will be
presented on Thursday at 8:15 in
Physics Tank.
Ingmar Bergman's The Virgin
Spring makes its second
appearance on campus screens this
year on Friday at Cubberley. This
somber but insightful parable of
man's religious and humanitarian
responsibilities won the Academy
Award for Best Foreign Film of
1960 and stars Max von Sydow.
The World of Apu is the final
film in Satyajit Ray's The Apu
Trilogy. This is perhaps the
strongest of the series, as Apu
attempts to make something of
his life in modern, middle-class
India. Music by Ravi Shankar. At
Tresidder on Friday night.
The Birds to be shown on
Saturday night at Tresidder, is
uneven Hitchcock; at times, it is
boring and technically shoddy but
at others, the atmosphere is as
chilling as the bird attacks are
frightening. Filmed on location in
San Francisco and Bodega Bay,
the picture features Rod Taylor,
Tippi Hedren, Jessica Tandy,
Suzanne Pleshette and electronic
bird sounds by Bernard
Herrmann.
Watching two guys surf for an
hour-and-a-half may not sound
like the best way to pass time but
The Endless Summer makes it
surprisingly entertaining. Shot in
16mm and blown up to 35mm,
the film is often beautiful and the
narration, while a bit naive, is
usually amusing. At the Sunday
Flicks.
