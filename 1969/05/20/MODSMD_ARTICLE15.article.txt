# Mendicants: Singing For Fun
## 
### JULIE FLEECE 
"We're not the best voices in
the world, but we're good enough
to have fun," says George Howe,
musical director of the
Mendicants. The Stanford male
vocal group is also good enough to
have a new album on sale at the
Stanford Bookstore.
Bill Garry, their assistant
director, enjoys recounting the
hours they spent doing the record.
Someone concocted a
tea-and-honey-and-lemon
juice-and whiskey brew to keep
their 13 voices going until they
finished the recording session.
Then, after they had recorded all
the songs, they stayed and sang
some moreâ€”for fun.
The main requirements for
members of the Mendicants seem
to be an ability to sing and a love
of hard work. They rehearse three
times a week, for an hour and a
half each time. They average
about six concerts a month, half
of them at Stanford and half
off-campus, although they would
like to travel more outside the Bay
Area.
The fun of singing together is
really the only reward for the
Mendicants, since they are a
non-profit organization and do
not receive financial aid from the
University. Their main source of
finances is their charge for
off-campus concerts. This goes
toward production of the records,
and sales of the records make up
the rest of their income.
The latest album is the
Mendicants' fifth in six years.
Songs on the album range from

the old standby "Harvest Moon"
to several popular numbers like
the Beatles' "Eleanor Rigby."
Most of the arrangements are
original, written especially for the
group.
Members of the Mendicants
admit to a constant problem in
deciding whether to sing for their
own enjoyment or to try artistic
styles of music. The decision
depends largely on the group
members each year. In the past
two years they have concentrated
more on popular adaptations.
Next year the Mendicants may
try more classical music, some
Gregorian chants, or some Russian
music. A church service with Dean
Napier is also a possibility for
next year.

The group's members are as
varied as the songs they sing. Only
one is a music major, and the rest
come from totally different
disciplines. Howe comments that
nowhere else could a graduate in
civil engineering or an
undergraduate in biology express
their musical abilities in such a
way.
Tryouts for anyone who would
like to join next year's Mendicants
will be held next week. Anyone
interested may go to Harmony
House from 7 to 8:30 Monday or
Wednesday night, or may contact
George Howe at 327-5530.
