# Ram's Head Presents Gay, Baudy Musical
## 
### 
"Lock Up Your Daughters" is
a gay, boisterous, bawdy musical
romp adapted by Bernard Miles
from Henry Fielding's Rape upon
Rape. This hilarious spoof of
English manners of the 18th
century will be presented in
Stanford University's Little
Theatre May 20 through May 24.
Set in the London of the 18th
century, "Lock Up Your
Daughters" is the story of a young
girl, Hilaret, whose father is far
more interested in politics than in
her well-being. She elopes, is
accidentally separated from her
lover, is rescued from a predatory
sailor only to fall foul of a
lecherous magistrate, the
notorious Justice Squuezum. She
attempts to turn the tables on him
but ultimately finds herself in jail
together with her lover and the
sailor, the latter having been
enthusiastically ravished by the
magistrate's wife.
It's a bawdy comedy of
London—a vivid picture of the
graft and greed and corruption
that so often passed for "justice"
in the 18th century.
When the Mermaid production
of "Lock Up Your Daughters"
was presented at the Shubert
Theatre in Boston in 1960, the
Theatre Manager received a letter
from the entertainment licensing
chief of the City who had
attended the first night. He
demanded extensive cuts in the
dialogue and songs and the
deletion of the entire bedroom
scene between Ramble and
Mistress Squeezum. That evening
a body of ten policemen arrived at
the theatre to ensure that Ramble

did not get into bed with Mistress
Squeezum, threatening to close
the show if she did.
Ram's Head, Stanford's
student drama organization, has
lined up an experienced and
versatile cast for "Lock Up Your
Daughters." Robin Lake, the
directed, was born in London not
far from the site of the present
Mermaid Theatre where "Lock Up
Your Daughters" premiered. He is
presently in his third year of
doctoral studies in the
Department of Speech and Drama
and on the local scene has
managed to keep busy in the
practical theater by stage
managing most of the Music
Department's Opera Workshops
over the past three years as well as
the recent Moliere and Feydeau
successes.

Jim Kason is featured as the
lecherous Mr. Squeezum, a
crooked magistrate whose biggest
source of trouble is his wife.
Kason is an MFA candidate in
drama and a graduate of San Jose
State College.
Sue bales plays the part of Mrs.
Squeezum. Currently she is a
graduate student in theater arts,
having graduated from the
University of Iowa in English. She
has performed in "Play" for
Ram's Head and "Blood
Wedding" for the Stanford
Repertory Theatre.
Kit Haight portrays the
innocent but nevertheless clever
Hilaret around whose
misadventures the plot revolves.
Kit graduated from Stanford in
1967 in music and has appeared in

more than eight Ram's Head and
Opera Workshop productions.
Bob McClaren, like Jim Kason,
worked in summer stock in New
York, performing in "South
Pacific," "Showboat," "The
Sound of Music," and "Camelot."
He has taught high school music
for five years after graduating as a
voice major at Adam State College
in Colorado.

"Lock Up Your Daughters" is
a gay, boisterous, bawdy musical
romp adapted by Bernard Miles
from Henry Fielding's Rape upon
Rape. This hilarious spoof of
English manners of the 18th
century will be presented in
Stanford University's Little
Theatre May 20 through May 24.
Set in the London of the 18th
century, "Lock Up Your
Daughters" is the story of a young
girl, Hilaret, whose father is far
more interested in politics than in
her well-being. She elopes, is
accidentally separated from her
lover, is rescued from a predatory
sailor only to fall foul of a
lecherous magistrate, the
notorious Justice Squuezum. She
attempts to turn the tables on him
but ultimately finds herself in jail
together with her lover and the
sailor, the latter having been
enthusiastically ravished by the
magistrate's wife.
It's a bawdy comedy of
London—a vivid picture of the
graft and greed and corruption
that so often passed for "justice"
in the 18th century.
When the Mermaid production
of "Lock Up Your Daughters"
was presented at the Shubert
Theatre in Boston in 1960, the
Theatre Manager received a letter
from the entertainment licensing
chief of the City who had
attended the first night. He
demanded extensive cuts in the
dialogue and songs and the
deletion of the entire bedroom
scene between Ramble and
Mistress Squeezum. That evening
a body of ten policemen arrived at
the theatre to ensure that Ramble

did not get into bed with Mistress
Squeezum, threatening to close
the show if she did.
Ram's Head, Stanford's
student drama organization, has
lined up an experienced and
versatile cast for "Lock Up Your
Daughters." Robin Lake, the
directed, was born in London not
far from the site of the present
Mermaid Theatre where "Lock Up
Your Daughters" premiered. He is
presently in his third year of
doctoral studies in the
Department of Speech and Drama
and on the local scene has
managed to keep busy in the
practical theater by stage
managing most of the Music
Department's Opera Workshops
over the past three years as well as
the recent Moliere and Feydeau
successes.

Jim Kason is featured as the
lecherous Mr. Squeezum, a
crooked magistrate whose biggest
source of trouble is his wife.
Kason is an MFA candidate in
drama and a graduate of San Jose
State College.
Sue bales plays the part of Mrs.
Squeezum. Currently she is a
graduate student in theater arts,
having graduated from the
University of Iowa in English. She
has performed in "Play" for
Ram's Head and "Blood
Wedding" for the Stanford
Repertory Theatre.
Kit Haight portrays the
innocent but nevertheless clever
Hilaret around whose
misadventures the plot revolves.
Kit graduated from Stanford in
1967 in music and has appeared in

more than eight Ram's Head and
Opera Workshop productions.
Bob McClaren, like Jim Kason,
worked in summer stock in New
York, performing in "South
Pacific," "Showboat," "The
Sound of Music," and "Camelot."
He has taught high school music
for five years after graduating as a
voice major at Adam State College
in Colorado.
