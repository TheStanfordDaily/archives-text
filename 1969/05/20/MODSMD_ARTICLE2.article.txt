•Leary Cleared
WASHINGTON (AP)- -The Supreme
Court Monday upset the conviction of
LSD High Priest Timothy K. Leary and
barred enforcement of the federal tax
on illegal marijuana transactions.
An 8-0 decision said the former

Harvard teacher was protected by the
Constitution from having to pay a tax
on the half-ounce of marijuana sweeping
found in his car when he crossed the
International Bridge from Mexico in
1966.
Had he paid the tax, Justice John M.
Harlan reasoned, he would have run the
risk of self-incrimination by exposing
himself to state prosecutions.
Harlan said the tax law is aimed "at
bringing to light transgressions of the
marijuana laws" and those who comply
run "a very substantial risk of
self-incrimination."

Monday for the city and surrounding
Alamance County.
National Guardsmen were ordered
into the city after Negroes marched on
the school administration building to
protest a cheerleader election at Walter
William High School in which no
Negroes were chosen.

Police said only a few arrests were
made Sunday and that no further
shooting incidents have been reported.
Authorities said it was not certain that
the bullet which killed the youth was
fired from a police or a sniper's gun.
•Advice On Draft
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Selective
Service System has decided to ask the
nation's youngsters what it's doing
wrong and what to do about it.

director of Selective Service, said
Monday that draft directors in
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Michigan, lowa
and in New York City, a separate
region, had set up young people's
advisory committees within the past six
months. He told all other state directors
early this month to create similar
committees.
The purpose, Hershey said, was to
give youth a voice in the draft system.
"I sort of hope and suspect these
kids will be more nearly average and
typical than some of the kids we hear
from these days," he commented.

•Leary Cleared
WASHINGTON (AP)- -The Supreme
Court Monday upset the conviction of
LSD High Priest Timothy K. Leary and
barred enforcement of the federal tax
on illegal marijuana transactions.
An 8-0 decision said the former

Harvard teacher was protected by the
Constitution from having to pay a tax
on the half-ounce of marijuana sweeping
found in his car when he crossed the
International Bridge from Mexico in
1966.
Had he paid the tax, Justice John M.
Harlan reasoned, he would have run the
risk of self-incrimination by exposing
himself to state prosecutions.
Harlan said the tax law is aimed "at
bringing to light transgressions of the
marijuana laws" and those who comply
run "a very substantial risk of
self-incrimination."

WASHINGTON (AP) —The Selective

director of Selective Service, said
Monday that draft directors in
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Michigan, lowa
and in New York City, a separate

"I sort of hope and suspect these
kids will be more nearly average and
typical than some of the kids we hear
from these days," he commented.

•Leary Cleared
WASHINGTON (AP)- -The Supreme
Court Monday upset the conviction of
LSD High Priest Timothy K. Leary and
barred enforcement of the federal tax
on illegal marijuana transactions.
An 8-0 decision said the former

Harvard teacher was protected by the
Constitution from having to pay a tax
on the half-ounce of marijuana sweeping
found in his car when he crossed the
International Bridge from Mexico in
1966.
Had he paid the tax, Justice John M.
Harlan reasoned, he would have run the
risk of self-incrimination by exposing
himself to state prosecutions.
Harlan said the tax law is aimed "at
bringing to light transgressions of the
marijuana laws" and those who comply
run "a very substantial risk of
self-incrimination."
• Campus Disturbances
Disturbances continued at campuses
throughout the nation yesterday.
At New York's City College, classes
were replaced by group discussion of
demands by Negro and Puerto Rican
students.
Four persons were arrested and
charged with fire bombing a New York
high school during disturbances of
younger students last month.
At Burlington, N.C., a
curfew —invoked over the weekend
following the fatal shooting Friday
night of a 16-year-old youth-was lifted
Monday for the city and surrounding
Alamance County.
National Guardsmen were ordered
into the city after Negroes marched on
the school administration building to
protest a cheerleader election at Walter
William High School in which no
Negroes were chosen.

Police said only a few arrests were
made Sunday and that no further
shooting incidents have been reported.
Authorities said it was not certain that
the bullet which killed the youth was
fired from a police or a sniper's gun.
•Advice On Draft
WASHINGTON (AP) —The Selective
Service System has decided to ask the
nation's youngsters what it's doing
wrong and what to do about it.
Lt. Gen. Lewis B. Hershey, national
director of Selective Service, said
Monday that draft directors in
Mississippi, Oklahoma, Michigan, lowa
and in New York City, a separate
region, had set up young people's
advisory committees within the past six
months. He told all other state directors
early this month to create similar
committees.
The purpose, Hershey said, was to
give youth a voice in the draft system.
"I sort of hope and suspect these
kids will be more nearly average and
typical than some of the kids we hear
from these days," he commented.

BERKELEY, Calif. (AP)-A
compromise solution to the "People's
Park" controversy which has generated
five days of disturbance was proposed
Monday by Mayor Wallace Johnson.
He urged the University of California
to lease to the city for $1 per year a
plot of land for a "People's Park" two
blocks west of where "street people"
took over a university-owned lot
recently without permission.

used tear gas to scatter demonstrators
who are protesting the university's
takeover of the "People's Park" last
Thursday and installingg a fence.
Meanwhile, some 500 National
Guardsmen sealed entrances to the
university campus.
Eight canisters of acrid gas were
hurled and the crowd of about 400 lied
from Sproul Plaza to Telegraph Avenue,
just off the campus.

amount of tear gas and clubbed a
half-dozen youths in scattering a crowd
of about 1,500 that tried to disrupt
business on nearby streets. Five arrests
were made.

four main doors, campus activists
Monday closed the administration
center of the University of California's
Santa Cruz campus in protest against
use of troops and guns in Berkeley. The

Cruz chancellor Dean MeHenrv and

faculty to urge a return of the People's
Park in Berkeley to the university towns
so-called street people.

deputies and police developed in
Berkeley Thursday when the
university-owned People's Park area was
fenced in for development into athletic
fields.
A Santa Cruz faculty and student
petition statement condemned "in the
strongest possible terms the use of
shotguns against students and other
demonstrators in the matter of the
so-called People's Park."
