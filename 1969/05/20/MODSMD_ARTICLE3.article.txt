# A3M Protest Halted Again; Phone-In Scheduled Today
## 
### 
By the DAILY News Staff
After two attempts at closing
clown the Hanover facility the April
Third Movement decided last night at a
general meeting in the Old Union
courtyard to "move on SRI when the
police are not there in force."
Yesterday police deterred more
than 250 demonstrators attempting to
force a traffic jam similar to the massive
congestion of last Friday at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) annex
on Hanover Street.
Today a phone-in to SRI and
perhaps various other locations in the
Industrial Park will be effected. Plans
also call for an open steering committee
meeting at noon today just outside
Tresidder.
When the decision to move on SRI
is made, it will be communicated by a
"phone tree," with everybody called
responsible for contacting additional
people and by a notice on the "dome"
in White Plaza.
Outnumber Demonstrators
Yesterday the police,

outnumbering the demonstrators, cut
short all attempts to back up traffic
near the Hanover Street facility. Six
arrests were made in the process.
April Third Movement members
later moved to the Menlo Park facility
and conducted peaceful picketing for
two hours during the early afternoon.
The Menlo Park picketing followed
a hastily called 11 a.m. rally in White
Plaza. An estimated crowd of 400
formed picket lines on the sidewalks
and distributed leaflets to nearby
homes. A force of more than 175
policemen guarded the building.
The day began, as it had Friday,
with demonstrators assemblying into
affinity groups in front of TMU and
moving in various directions toward the
Hanover annex.
Greet Protesters
Yesterday, however, a force of 229
policemen were on hand to greet them.
Police blocked the California and Page
Mill entrances to Hanover Street,
forcing demonstrators to place
barricades at large distances from the
annex. A police helicopter hovered
above and roadblocks were removed
almost as quickly as they were placed.
About 40 demonstrators
temporarily disrupted traffic at 7:45 on
Page Mill Road. Wearing gauze masks
for tear gas, they brought in barricades
and briefly stopped traffic. Nearly 40
police came in quickly by bus, and the
demonstrators fell back.
Following an order to disperse at
8:10, police moved against
demonstrators who had gathered at the
intersection of Hanover and California
Avenue forcing them east on California
toward Harvard and Oberlin.
During the retreat and in the
generally quiet period which followed
six arrests were made.
Arrested for failure to disperse
were James L. Russell, 22, a former
student, Elizabeth Sutton, a Stanford
student; Kathleen D. Silva, 23, a
housewife; Patrick N. Silva, 22; and
James S. Clapp 21, a Stanford student.
Bail Set
Bail was set for $315 each. All
were bailed out soon after.
Arrested, for resisting arrest as well
as failure to disperse, was Peter F.
Schill, 23, a student.
Schill and Russell were
apprehended in a private residence on
the corner of California and Hanover
approximately twenty minutes after the
order to disperse had been read.
The two had been standing with a
small group of people on the corner of
the intersection. When a half dozen
police charged the group, several ran
inside the yard of the corner house.
They closed the gate just prior to the
arrival of the police.
Smash Gate
One of the police smashed through
the closed gate and the others followed
him in. Observers near the scene,
including Prof. Leland Smith of the
Stanford Music Department, reported
that one policeman broke through the
glass garage door and pulled out one of
the men chased into the yard and
garage.
Two other police grabbed another
man leaning on the fence inside the
yard. One policeman restrained him
with a strangle-hold using his club, while
another placed him in handcuffs.

Nearby, a small bus converted into
an ambulance was parked on a side
street away from the actual area of
police-student confrontation so that it
could leave unimpeded for the hospital.
As the students retreated farther down
the street, three medics moved quickly
into the ambulance to switch locations.
Makeshift Ambulance
Just as they were getting into the
makeshift ambulance, a bus of
policemen drew up next to them. A
medic on the street heard one of the
officers shout, "Get those medics."
The bus swerved and blocked the
ambulance, trapping it in the parking
space. Barbara Hyland, a.medic who was
sitting in the back of the ambulance,
said she saw hands grab the driver as he
was dragged from the driver's seat.
Police came to the back of the
ambulance and pulled another medic
out.
Walks Away
Meanwhile Hyland had been taken
from the back of the ambulance. Police
frisking the medic who had been in the
back of the ambulance, apparently took
the medical supplies he had in his
pockets.
One officer asked if the medics
were to be arrested. Someone
apparently said no; the police let all
three prisoners free and hopped back on
the bus.
Last night at the general meeting
the promise was voted on and accepted.
An anonymous call was received by
KZSU soon after promising the
developed film to the Movement at 9
a.m. this morning.

Throughout the day it was
apparent that members of the Young
Americans for Freedom had been given
virtual immunity by police to cross
police lines and assist in making
identifications.
Members of YAF were scene
directly in front of the fire station
across from Hanover and later on the
roof just above the main entrance at the
Menlo Park facility.
Several members of the group were
serving injunctions which had been
issued against demonstrators the day
before. The injunction forbids trespass
and disruption of SRI activities.
During the morning several
blue-buttoned YAF people were scene
along with Professor Jean Mayers of
Aeronautical Engineering patrolling the
Hanover area.
At one point Mayers tried to break
up a human roadblock which formed at
Page Mill road. Mayers was seen rushing
one girl protestor attempting to block
traffic. He knocked her helmet off as
the San Jose Police bus moved in.
Mayers screamed, "They're afraid of the
cops, Go get'em fellas. You can run
faster than they can; they've been living
on marijuana. Get'em; geronimo."
In the afternoon, picketers
demonstrated in relative peace.
The only afternoon incident
occurred when students Jim Shock and
Larry Christiani were picked up by
police for disturbing the peace and
throwing objects at vehicles. Shock was
later released without charges.

said she saw hands grab the driver as he
was dragged from the driver's seat.
Police came to the back of the
ambulance and pulled another medic
out.
Walks Away
Meanwhile Hyland had been taken
from the back of the ambulance. Police
frisking the medic who had been in the
back of the ambulance, apparently took
the medical supplies he had in his
pockets.
One officer asked if the medics
were to be arrested. Someone
apparently said no; the police let all
three prisoners free and hopped back on
the bus.
Last night at the general meeting
the promise was voted on and accepted.
An anonymous call was received by
KZSU soon after promising the
developed film to the Movement at 9
a.m. this morning.

Throughout the day it was
apparent that members of the Young
Americans for Freedom had been given
virtual immunity by police to cross
police lines and assist in making
identifications.
Members of YAF were scene
directly in front of the fire station
across from Hanover and later on the
roof just above the main entrance at the
Menlo Park facility.
Several members of the group were
serving injunctions which had been
issued against demonstrators the day
before. The injunction forbids trespass
and disruption of SRI activities.
During the morning several
blue-buttoned YAF people were scene
along with Professor Jean Mayers of
Aeronautical Engineering patrolling the
Hanover area.
At one point Mayers tried to break
up a human roadblock which formed at
Page Mill road. Mayers was seen rushing
one girl protestor attempting to block
traffic. He knocked her helmet off as
the San Jose Police bus moved in.
Mayers screamed, "They're afraid of the
cops, Go get'em fellas. You can run
faster than they can; they've been living
on marijuana. Get'em; geronimo."
In the afternoon, picketers
demonstrated in relative peace.
The only afternoon incident
occurred when students Jim Shock and
Larry Christiani were picked up by
police for disturbing the peace and
throwing objects at vehicles. Shock was
later released without charges.

After two attempts at closing
clown the Hanover facility the April
Third Movement decided last night at a
general meeting in the Old Union
courtyard to "move on SRI when the
police are not there in force."
Yesterday police deterred more
than 250 demonstrators attempting to
force a traffic jam similar to the massive
congestion of last Friday at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) annex
on Hanover Street.
Today a phone-in to SRI and
perhaps various other locations in the
Industrial Park will be effected. Plans
also call for an open steering committee
meeting at noon today just outside
Tresidder.
When the decision to move on SRI
is made, it will be communicated by a
"phone tree," with everybody called
responsible for contacting additional
people and by a notice on the "dome"
in White Plaza.
Outnumber Demonstrators
Yesterday the police,

outnumbering the demonstrators, cut
short all attempts to back up traffic
near the Hanover Street facility. Six
arrests were made in the process.
April Third Movement members
later moved to the Menlo Park facility
and conducted peaceful picketing for
two hours during the early afternoon.
The Menlo Park picketing followed
a hastily called 11 a.m. rally in White
Plaza. An estimated crowd of 400
formed picket lines on the sidewalks
and distributed leaflets to nearby
homes. A force of more than 175
policemen guarded the building.
The day began, as it had Friday,
with demonstrators assemblying into
affinity groups in front of TMU and
moving in various directions toward the
Hanover annex.
Greet Protesters
Yesterday, however, a force of 229
policemen were on hand to greet them.
Police blocked the California and Page
Mill entrances to Hanover Street,
forcing demonstrators to place
barricades at large distances from the
annex. A police helicopter hovered
above and roadblocks were removed
almost as quickly as they were placed.
About 40 demonstrators
temporarily disrupted traffic at 7:45 on
Page Mill Road. Wearing gauze masks
for tear gas, they brought in barricades
and briefly stopped traffic. Nearly 40
police came in quickly by bus, and the
demonstrators fell back.
Following an order to disperse at
8:10, police moved against
demonstrators who had gathered at the
intersection of Hanover and California
Avenue forcing them east on California
toward Harvard and Oberlin.
During the retreat and in the
generally quiet period which followed
six arrests were made.
Arrested for failure to disperse
were James L. Russell, 22, a former
student, Elizabeth Sutton, a Stanford
student; Kathleen D. Silva, 23, a
housewife; Patrick N. Silva, 22; and
James S. Clapp 21, a Stanford student.
Bail Set
Bail was set for $315 each. All
were bailed out soon after.
Arrested, for resisting arrest as well
as failure to disperse, was Peter F.
Schill, 23, a student.
Schill and Russell were
apprehended in a private residence on
the corner of California and Hanover
approximately twenty minutes after the
order to disperse had been read.
The two had been standing with a
small group of people on the corner of
the intersection. When a half dozen
police charged the group, several ran
inside the yard of the corner house.
They closed the gate just prior to the
arrival of the police.
Smash Gate
One of the police smashed through
the closed gate and the others followed
him in. Observers near the scene,
including Prof. Leland Smith of the
Stanford Music Department, reported
that one policeman broke through the
glass garage door and pulled out one of
the men chased into the yard and
garage.
Two other police grabbed another
man leaning on the fence inside the
yard. One policeman restrained him
with a strangle-hold using his club, while
another placed him in handcuffs.

Nearby, a small bus converted into
an ambulance was parked on a side
street away from the actual area of
police-student confrontation so that it
could leave unimpeded for the hospital.
As the students retreated farther down
the street, three medics moved quickly
into the ambulance to switch locations.
Makeshift Ambulance
Just as they were getting into the
makeshift ambulance, a bus of
policemen drew up next to them. A
medic on the street heard one of the
officers shout, "Get those medics."
The bus swerved and blocked the
ambulance, trapping it in the parking
space. Barbara Hyland, a.medic who was
sitting in the back of the ambulance,
said she saw hands grab the driver as he
was dragged from the driver's seat.
Police came to the back of the
ambulance and pulled another medic
out.

police came in quickly by bus, and the
demonstrators fell back.
Following an order to disperse at
8:10, police moved against
demonstrators who had gathered at the
intersection of Hanover and California
Avenue forcing them east on California
toward Harvard and Oberlin.
During the retreat and in the
generally quiet period which followed
six arrests were made.
Arrested for failure to disperse
were James L. Russell, 22, a former
student, Elizabeth Sutton, a Stanford
student; Kathleen D. Silva, 23, a
housewife; Patrick N. Silva, 22; and
James S. Clapp 21, a Stanford student.
Bail Set
Bail was set for $315 each. All
were bailed out soon after.
Arrested, for resisting arrest as well
as failure to disperse, was Peter F.
Schill, 23, a student.
Schill and Russell were
apprehended in a private residence on
the corner of California and Hanover
approximately twenty minutes after the
order to disperse had been read.
The two had been standing with a
small group of people on the corner of
the intersection. When a half dozen
police charged the group, several ran
inside the yard of the corner house.
They closed the gate just prior to the
arrival of the police.
Smash Gate
One of the police smashed through
the closed gate and the others followed
him in. Observers near the scene,
including Prof. Leland Smith of the
Stanford Music Department, reported
that one policeman broke through the
glass garage door and pulled out one of
the men chased into the yard and
garage.
Two other police grabbed another
man leaning on the fence inside the
yard. One policeman restrained him
with a strangle-hold using his club, while
another placed him in handcuffs.

Nearby, a small bus converted into
an ambulance was parked on a side
street away from the actual area of
police-student confrontation so that it
could leave unimpeded for the hospital.
As the students retreated farther down
the street, three medics moved quickly
into the ambulance to switch locations.
Makeshift Ambulance
Just as they were getting into the
makeshift ambulance, a bus of
policemen drew up next to them. A
medic on the street heard one of the
officers shout, "Get those medics."
The bus swerved and blocked the
ambulance, trapping it in the parking
space. Barbara Hyland, a.medic who was
sitting in the back of the ambulance,
said she saw hands grab the driver as he
was dragged from the driver's seat.
Police came to the back of the
ambulance and pulled another medic
out.
Walks Away
Meanwhile Hyland had been taken
from the back of the ambulance. Police
frisking the medic who had been in the
back of the ambulance, apparently took
the medical supplies he had in his
pockets.
One officer asked if the medics
were to be arrested. Someone
apparently said no; the police let all
three prisoners free and hopped back on
the bus.
Last night at the general meeting
the promise was voted on and accepted.
An anonymous call was received by
KZSU soon after promising the
developed film to the Movement at 9
a.m. this morning.

Throughout the day it was
apparent that members of the Young
Americans for Freedom had been given
virtual immunity by police to cross
police lines and assist in making
identifications.
Members of YAF were scene
directly in front of the fire station
across from Hanover and later on the
roof just above the main entrance at the
Menlo Park facility.
Several members of the group were
serving injunctions which had been
issued against demonstrators the day
before. The injunction forbids trespass
and disruption of SRI activities.
During the morning several
blue-buttoned YAF people were scene
along with Professor Jean Mayers of
Aeronautical Engineering patrolling the
Hanover area.
At one point Mayers tried to break
up a human roadblock which formed at
Page Mill road. Mayers was seen rushing
one girl protestor attempting to block
traffic. He knocked her helmet off as
the San Jose Police bus moved in.
Mayers screamed, "They're afraid of the
cops, Go get'em fellas. You can run
faster than they can; they've been living
on marijuana. Get'em; geronimo."
In the afternoon, picketers
demonstrated in relative peace.
The only afternoon incident
occurred when students Jim Shock and
Larry Christiani were picked up by
police for disturbing the peace and
throwing objects at vehicles. Shock was
later released without charges.

After two attempts at closing
clown the Hanover facility the April
Third Movement decided last night at a
general meeting in the Old Union
courtyard to "move on SRI when the
police are not there in force."
Yesterday police deterred more
than 250 demonstrators attempting to
force a traffic jam similar to the massive
congestion of last Friday at the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI) annex
on Hanover Street.
Today a phone-in to SRI and
perhaps various other locations in the
Industrial Park will be effected. Plans
also call for an open steering committee
meeting at noon today just outside
Tresidder.
When the decision to move on SRI
is made, it will be communicated by a
"phone tree," with everybody called
responsible for contacting additional
people and by a notice on the "dome"
in White Plaza.
Outnumber Demonstrators
Yesterday the police,

outnumbering the demonstrators, cut
short all attempts to back up traffic
near the Hanover Street facility. Six
arrests were made in the process.
April Third Movement members
later moved to the Menlo Park facility
and conducted peaceful picketing for
two hours during the early afternoon.
The Menlo Park picketing followed
a hastily called 11 a.m. rally in White
Plaza. An estimated crowd of 400
formed picket lines on the sidewalks
and distributed leaflets to nearby
homes. A force of more than 175
policemen guarded the building.
The day began, as it had Friday,
with demonstrators assemblying into
affinity groups in front of TMU and
moving in various directions toward the
Hanover annex.
Greet Protesters
Yesterday, however, a force of 229
policemen were on hand to greet them.
Police blocked the California and Page
Mill entrances to Hanover Street,
forcing demonstrators to place
barricades at large distances from the
annex. A police helicopter hovered
above and roadblocks were removed
almost as quickly as they were placed.
About 40 demonstrators
temporarily disrupted traffic at 7:45 on
Page Mill Road. Wearing gauze masks
for tear gas, they brought in barricades
and briefly stopped traffic. Nearly 40
police came in quickly by bus, and the
demonstrators fell back.
