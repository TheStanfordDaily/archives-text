## 
### ROGER REED 
The United Christian Ministry
(UCM) has decided to deny the April
3rd Movement (A3M) the further use of
facilities on the third floor of the
Clubhouse in the Old Union Building.
The use of these facilities was
offered originally as an alternative to
the Applied Electronics Laboratory as a
center for the pursuit of the goals of
A3M pertaining to war-related research.
Following the Encina sit-in, a more
limited use of the facilities was allowed
in the hope that progress toward the
goals still could be achieved through
educational and organizational
activities.
R. Richard Roe, Director of the
Campus Ministry, announced that the
UCM staff is disappointed that so few of
the A3M goals had been realized and is
committedsio the continued pursuit of
their concerns.
Roe said, however, that the UCM

staff had decided to deny further use of
their facilities to the A3M because
"most of the staff are unable to support
the latest decisions of the A3M." He
added that the extensive use of facilities
by the ASM made it difficult to exercise
the total UCM ministry.
The A3M recently applied to the
Publications Board for the use of space
in the Storke Publications Building. The
Board decided that the A3M could use
space in the Storke Building for putting
out publications, but that the A3M
could not hold their meetings there.
Paul Rupert, of the UCM and the
A3M, said that the A3M would hold
their meetings in private homes and
around their dome constructed in front
of Tresidder Memorial Union.
Leonard Segal of the A3M added
that the A3M would continue to meet
in dormitories and lounges. He
remarked: "Finding places to meet is no
problem this time of year."
