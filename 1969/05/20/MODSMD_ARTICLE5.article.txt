The activity of spring quarter
continues to grind on, but the campus
events catalogue is off the press and
ready for distribution.
If the 1969 Quad is not like Stanford
yearbooks in years, it is because in
large part the campus climate is

exploits of Vicky Drake missed the
press run deadline, this year the battle
for primacy of ideals, morals, and
interests continues while the chronicle
is ready for sale and handing out.
The struggles continue, and the Quad
has endeavored with admirable success
to record the underlying causes of

discontent which is interspersed
between the general outward
appearance of tranquility.

artistic product, this year's effort gets

community and the outside community,
the conservatives and the radicals on
which this year's record should be built.
