## The 						1969 Quad: Art Si, Content No 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The activity of spring quarter
continues to grind on, but the campus
events catalogue is off the press and
ready for distribution.
If the 1969 Quad is not like Stanford
yearbooks in years, it is because in
large part the campus climate is
changing. Whereas last yeai only the
exploits of Vicky Drake missed the
press run deadline, this year the battle
for primacy of ideals, morals, and
interests continues while the chronicle
is ready for sale and handing out.
The struggles continue, and the Quad
has endeavored with admirable success
to record the underlying causes of

discontent which is interspersed
between the general outward
appearance of tranquility.
However, as a uniformly well done
artistic product, this year's effort gets
off to a slow start in reproducing the
interaction between students and the
rest of the University, the campus
community and the outside community,
the conservatives and the radicals on
which this year's record should be built.

Artistic F.ndoator
Through the glare, this year's colored
picture section demonstrates the
photographic excellence of Dave Bitts,
former Daily photo editor, and his
staff. As an artistic endeavor it is
faultless; as a nostalgia-inducing
device for the alumni years it is
perfect; but as an almost
captionless review of the year's
events it is a disappointing
experience for anyone who has
been involved in any aspect of the
student movement this year.
Much more to the point is the
following section, aptly entitled
"What Ought Stanford to Be?" As
the editors note, "It was this
question . . .that underlay the
interests and activitism of the
Stanford community,
1968-1969."
The whole section takes the
gamut of extra-curricular activity
at Stanford and reweaves them in

significant individual actions.
What it lacks in sensationalism
and excitement of day-to-day
coverage of campus events is
replaced by a clear delineation of
how the year proceeded and the
commitments that need to be
followed up.
Poor Captions
Once again, however, the
poorly captioned individual
photographs leave many's
significance masked.
This section, and ensuing black
and white photograph sections,
suffer somewhat by overly dark
reproduction. As such, it was an
over compensation by the Quad
staff and the printer for criticism
of last year's overly gray shots.
The profiles by Mary Treiber

and others of administrators and
faculty members are both
interesting and revealing. For
instance, there is the observation
by political science Prof. Robert
Horn that those teaching
assistants that make the personal
sacrifice to teach are "getting the
short end of the stick around
here."
The extensive section on
athletics combines the always
excellent Quad sports
photography with a detailed
description of the action
surrounding the pictured events.
Bill Adams and Steve Webb,
co-editors, have drawn up a
genuinely hard hitting, realistic
appraisal of what made Stanford
this year.

following section, aptly entitled
"What Ought Stanford to Be?" As
the editors note, "It was this
question . . .that underlay the
interests and activitism of the
Stanford community,
1968-1969."
The whole section takes the
gamut of extra-curricular activity
at Stanford and reweaves them in

significant individual actions.
What it lacks in sensationalism
and excitement of day-to-day
coverage of campus events is
replaced by a clear delineation of
how the year proceeded and the
commitments that need to be
followed up.
Poor Captions
Once again, however, the
poorly captioned individual
photographs leave many's
significance masked.
This section, and ensuing black
and white photograph sections,
suffer somewhat by overly dark
reproduction. As such, it was an
over compensation by the Quad
staff and the printer for criticism
of last year's overly gray shots.
The profiles by Mary Treiber

and others of administrators and
faculty members are both
interesting and revealing. For
instance, there is the observation
by political science Prof. Robert
Horn that those teaching
assistants that make the personal
sacrifice to teach are "getting the
short end of the stick around
here."
The extensive section on
athletics combines the always
excellent Quad sports
photography with a detailed
description of the action
surrounding the pictured events.
Bill Adams and Steve Webb,
co-editors, have drawn up a
genuinely hard hitting, realistic
appraisal of what made Stanford
this year.
The activity of spring quarter
continues to grind on, but the campus
events catalogue is off the press and
ready for distribution.
If the 1969 Quad is not like Stanford
yearbooks in years, it is because in
large part the campus climate is
changing. Whereas last yeai only the
exploits of Vicky Drake missed the
press run deadline, this year the battle
for primacy of ideals, morals, and
interests continues while the chronicle
is ready for sale and handing out.
The struggles continue, and the Quad
has endeavored with admirable success
to record the underlying causes of

discontent which is interspersed
between the general outward
appearance of tranquility.
However, as a uniformly well done
artistic product, this year's effort gets
off to a slow start in reproducing the
interaction between students and the
rest of the University, the campus
community and the outside community,
the conservatives and the radicals on
which this year's record should be built.
Artistic F.ndoator
Through the glare, this year's colored
picture section demonstrates the
photographic excellence of Dave Bitts,
former Daily photo editor, and his
staff. As an artistic endeavor it is
faultless; as a nostalgia-inducing
device for the alumni years it is
perfect; but as an almost
captionless review of the year's
events it is a disappointing
experience for anyone who has
been involved in any aspect of the
student movement this year.
Much more to the point is the
