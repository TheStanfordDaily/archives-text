## Is Russia Behind All Of You Idiots? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
To Stanford University
students: Is Russia behind all of
you idiots? She isn't stopping war
research—going ahead full steam.
But is smart enough to
convince leaders here to attack
our policeman, universities, now
ROTC. Negroes want $500,000
from Catholic Churches. They
have all lost their marbles. I
wouldn't be surprised if they
started dragging citizens out of
their homes. If they could, they
would. But I'm sure mad about
trying to stop our ROTC. 80% of
military officers are trained
through ROTC. Are you all nuts?
Commies want this stopped—so
they could easily move in. How
stupid are the students
throughout the country. Dopes on
pills. Their appearances are
nauseating—look filthy, long hair,
beards, clothes. Wow —I'm a
grandmother and I'm worried
about my grandchildrens' future.
Communists are crowding this
country. You're all helping.
Disgusted,
Grandmother
• Misunderstanding
Editor, I lit DAILY:
On Wednesday I found in my
mailbox a letter from Mr. Jim
Schnieder of CAC in which I find
myself and others who
re-scheduled Monday classes
accused of "subverting several
principles of freedom of
expression." On the same day, a
letter in the Daily from Mr. John
Wilson speaks of the
"irresponsible behavior" of those
who did not teach on Monday.
Both writers reveal what I will
charitably assume to be a
misunderstanding of why classes
were re-scheduled, and they
deserve, in the same spirit of
charity, a reply.
First of all, I might say that I
do not greatly care for the role of
professor as conceived by Mr.
Schnieder and Mr. Wilson.
Whereas the student has "every
right to boycott classes," it
appears that the teaching
members of the University are
expected to officiate over a
classroom which has suddenly
become a kind of voting booth for

the simple-minded. Mr. Wilson
states that "a boycott of classes is
effective only when there are
classes to boycott." His logic is
impeccable, but he surely must
have realized that far more than a
boycott of classes was at stake.
The notion that the degree of
emptiness of each classroom was
to be measured and then offered
as a result of some sort of Gallup
Poll for the mute is as puerile as it
is ludicrous. A Monday morning
tooth-ache would presumably
have been construed as a vote for
the A3M.
I hope that the Coalition for an
Academic Community, presided
over by Mr. Schnieder, has more
means of expression at its disposal
than walking into or out of a
classroom. While Mr. Schnieder
and his followers were expressing
their freedom of expression in this
manner, other people were
articulating their thoughts
elsewhere in a much more precise
and engaging fashion. Finally let
me voice the hope that I am
wrong in assuming that Mr. John
Wilson and Mr. Schnieder are
equating responsiblity with
keeping one's mouth shut in the
face of a moral crisis. This is the
sort of responsibility which led to
Ausschwitz and Hiroshima

• Immorality
Editor, THE DAILY:
First of all, may I commend
the Daily on another issue of fine
objective reporting. Having read
the Daily for the past nine
months, I look forward to
summer.
In response to Jenny
Matthew's response to Mrs.
George Romney (in Monday's
Daily):
Everyone agrees; the moral
crisis is not just sexual, but you
still fail to discuss (or logically
condemn as the tone of your
article infers) the ideas Mrs.
Romney offers on sexual
immorality. Mrs. Romney was not
defending the Vietnam War or
killing, far from it. To write off
sexual immorality because she
supports a government that
"sponsors widespread immorality
in Vietnam" is ridiculous. Face
the issues! We cannot continue to
hide our faults behind the

Vietnam War. Each issue must be
faced separately sometimes. Two
wrongs do not make a right.
To the faculty who consider
withholding grades in support of
the A3M or any other demands:
When you agree to teach you
accept the responsibility to teach
to all students, whether they share
your views or not. By withholding
grades you penalize your students,
for your beliefs. Ridiculous? Yes!
If you feel so strongly, why not
boycott your teaching. Meet your
students outside of class; the
students can still learn the
material from you. But now your
job is on the line, not the students
units. You will have done
something. You will have put
something of yours on the line.

• Fiasco
Editor, THE DAILY:
Again the Stanford
Community has been witness to a
radical led debacle. Friday's fiasco
at the Stanford Industrial Park
was yet another example of issue
expression at its worst. The
resulting polarization is certainly
tragic, but the real tragedy lies in
the fact that such vital and
complicated issues come to be
expressed through such
malfunctioning groups as SBS,
The Half-wit Liberation Front and
the April Bowel Movement.
