## We Are Destroying The A3M 
### 
Gregg Murphy

It seems a bit ridiculous to have to ask Stanford students to
rethink their politics and their ensuing actions, but I feel it is
necessary in view of recent campus disruptions. I have observed,
participated, grown, and been educated by the April 3rd
Movement. This entire community has become aware of many ills
of our society through its diligent and constructive efforts. But
now an insidious exercise in power is leading students into a
behavior that is incongruous to their philosophy.
Throughout the short life of the movement I have personally
been impotent in much of the constructive work because I have
felt lost for a direction in which to turn. But I did still feel that it
was imperative that I support the A3M at least by participation
because of its goals. I criticize the majority on this campus who
also supported the views of the A3M but stayed uninvolved on
the periphery arguing that they could not identify with the
tactics of the movement. Dammit, the movement was
representing the sentiment of this community and there was no
excuse for people who were concerned to not become involved
and make A3M identify with their feelings. I therefore partly
blame the majority of this campus for the demise of a once
constructive and beneficial coalition.
We have been educated and we have educated, but now we
have become as hypocritical as the society we are seeking to
change. We did not get our demands met completely, but we did
not meet with defeat either. The issues have been separated
though and in order to keep the A3M as a legitimized political
movement we must approach each demand as an entity in itself.
If we so decide, we can challenge the Trustees' right to power, we
can make demands for educational reform with the benefits from
the sale of SRI, and we can continue to work against war-related
research at SRI. But we can only accomplish this through
justifiable means of demonstration.

We have shown our power by educating the masses in our
community in a few short weeks and we have made numerous
gains through their support that will exert, with further
constructive actions, the necessary force on our government to
legislate to the will of the people. Yet we must realize that the
process is slow because the people are—but it is legitimate. We
cannot protest against illegitimate power and then be so arrogant
as to grant ourselves power th?t is not ours.
This is why I now feel that we are failing and thereby
destroying the A3M. We are allowing ourselves to be misled by
supposedly democratic procedures into revolutionary acts of
violence that call only for destruction. The leadership of A3M no
longer discusses the issues or seeks viable solutions to attaining
our demands. They are attempting to rationalize acts of violence
that were originally contradictory to the basic philosophy of
A3M. They are asking why we do not follow them into Encina or
throw rocks into SRI and yet they induce us to vote for a
demand of amnesty for their actions. If they are not willing to be
held responsible for their conduct then why do we take the
responsibility?
SRl's relationship to Stanford will be severed and we cannot
change that through coercive tactics. Maybe nothing will prevent
severence, but we can work around it. We must not lose focus of
legitimate and constructive efforts by falling prey to esoteric
verbiage of a few who only seek a destruction of the system. If
we are not willing to be held responsible for our actions, then we
are not justified in those actions. We must continue to think out
our politics and act accordingly. If we persist with the disruptive
tactics of late, then we have only ourselves to blame for the death
and subsequent devaluation of the April 3rd Movement . . .and
we have only ourselves to execrate for the forceful proceedings
brought against us.
