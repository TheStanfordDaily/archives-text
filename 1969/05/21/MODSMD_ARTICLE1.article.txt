# Helicopter Gases UC Crowd Mourning Shooting Death
## 
### 
BERKELEY (AP)-Crowds
memorializing a dead riot victim were
dispersed at the University of California
Tuesday by a shower of tear gas from a
National Guard helicopter and officers
with sprayers on the gound.
Demonstrators increasing from a few
hundred to 2,000 milled and marched
back and fourth much of the day.
Police, National Guardsmen,
Highway Patrolmen and sheriff's
deputies periodically herded them out
of the University's Sproul Plaza, then
off Berkeley streets and back onto
University property.
Many in the crowd wore black arm
bands. Some carried black balloons in
mourning for James Rector, 25, who
died Monday night of wounds suffered
in Thursday's rioting.

The Thursday clashes were touched
off by university repossession of a
vacant lot which non-students and
students had converted into a "people's
park."
Police used shotguns loaded with
birdshot to break up the Thursday riot
>n which 128 persons, including 60
police, were wounded or injured.
Rector was one of those shot. A
coroner's autopsy showed his body
contained "three metallic objects which
appear to be the same size as No. 00
buckshot." Buckshot is larger and more
lethal than birdshot.
Police in San Jose, where Rector
lived, said he was on 2-year probation
for conviction in December, 1967, for
burglary and possession of marijuana,
for which he served 60 days in jail.

They said he also had received a
2-year probation in April, 1967, for
possession of stolen property. They
registered him July 22, 1968, as a
narcotics user.
He was not a student. Probation
ollicers said they had been seeking him
for failure to report.
Gov. Ronald Reagan admitted
yesterday that his information
confirmed the report that Rector had
been killed by shots from police.
However, he claimed, "It is my
understanding that his particular injury
did come from birdshot . . ."
Reagan also told newsmen, "1 now
urgeâ€”more deeply than it is possible to
express that those relative few who are
seeking to destroy us by turning one
against the other must be dealt with

firmly and swiftly and with the justice
they deserve."
Nonviolent I irst
Tear gas was used yesterday first to
disperse a crowd of some 200 which had
gathered in a non-violent protest outside
the home of Chancellor Roger VV.
Heyns. The fleeing crowd threw some
rocks.
Guardsmen and officers then donned
masks and a warning was broadcast to
clear Sproul Plaza, the main campus
center, as chemicals would be dropped.
Three minutes later, a helicopter
swooped within 60 feet of the ground
and discharged gas-laden powder.
Many students did not have time to
flee through the plaza's only open exit
and were trapped in the chemicals. But,
within five minutes the plaza was
deserted.
In other campus action, the Faculty
Union met to consider the campus
crisis. The 200-250 members who
attended the meeting voted
overwhelmingly not to perform their
"usual academic jobs" until national
guard troops are withdrawn. They will
devote their energies towards
de-escalating the conflict.
Professor Mishell, a spokesman for
the Union, said, "Some of us believe
that there might be a massacre up here."
Additional Resolutions
The faculty members passed two
additional resolutions. One condemned
the chancellor, governor, and regents for
their handling of the situation. Their
statement held Heyns responsible for
Hector's death and called for his
resignation.
The other resolution supported a
proposed solution to the crisis suggested
by the Environmental Design College
several weeks ago. The plan would
convert the park into a field station for
Environmental Design Studies.
