WASHINGTON—You can lalk
about the antiballistic missile
system from now until doomsday
(I'm sorry I had to usethatword),
but you still go around in circles.
One of the strongest
proponents of the ABM system is
a friend of mine who has been
assigned by the Pentagon to
convince skeptics like myself that
we really need an ABM system.
Since they have no funds yet, I
bought him a drink.
"I don't think I could make a
stronger argument for the ABM,"
he said, "than the fact that
Secretary Laird has revealed the
Soviets will have a first-strike
nuclear capability by 1975."
"That's pretty strong," I
admitted. "But how come
Secretary Laird found out about
this first-strike Soviet capability
and Secretaries McNamara and
Clifford knew nothing about it?"
"Laird reads more."
Reasoning
"Look, a few months ago you
told me that the reason we needed
an ABM system was to protect
our cities from Soviet missiles.
Then you said it was to protect
our cities from Red Chinese
missiles. After that, you said it
was impossible to protect the
cities so we had to protect our
missile launching sites. Now you
say we need it because the Soviets
are building new first-strike
missiles. Why don't you make up
your mind?"
"Actually, it's a little of this
and a little of that,' he said,
unperturbed. "We know we need
the system, but we're still not
quite sure what we need it for. It
has many uses.
"For example, the Soviets are
building an ABM system
Moscow. Now we know it doesn't
work, but we're not certain the
Soviets know it doesn't work. So
if we build an ABM system,
they'll find out ours doesn't work,
and then they'll have to assume
their system doesn't work either."
"I get it," I said excitedly. "If
we didn't have an ABM system,
the Soviets might put too much
value on the one they have."
"Righto. Now we also have to
think in terms of disarmament.
When we have a disarmament
meeting with the Soviets, we're
going to have to give up
something. Right?"
"Of course. That is what
disarmament is all about,"

"We don't want to give up
something that could endanger
the security of the country, so, if
we have the ABM system, we can
give that up instead. Of course, if
we didn't have an ABM system for
disarmament purposes, we'd have
to invent one."
He continued:
"I know there are many
scientists and Nobel Prize winners
who are attacking the system, but
what they don't realize is that if
they say the system won't work,
the Soviets will be encouraged to
go ahead with their offensive
missiles, and the more missiles
they stockpile the more they will

be encouraged to try a first
strike."
"But why?"
"Because Secretary Laird says
so."
"What about the cost?"
"That's all anyone ever thinks
about when you mention the
ABM in this country—money,"
my friend said in disgust. "Instead
of worrying about what it's going
to cost, you should get down on
your knees and say 'Thank God I
can live in a country that can
afford an antiballistic missile
system."
"Sometimes," I said
ashamedly, "Americans don't
know how lucky they really are."

strike."
"But why?"
"Because Secretary Laird says
so."
"What about the cost?"
"That's all anyone ever thinks
about when you mention the
ABM in this country—money,"
my friend said in disgust. "Instead
of worrying about what it's going
to cost, you should get down on
your knees and say 'Thank God I
can live in a country that can
afford an antiballistic missile
system."
"Sometimes," I said
ashamedly, "Americans don't
know how lucky they really are."
WASHINGTON—You can lalk
about the antiballistic missile
system from now until doomsday
(I'm sorry I had to usethatword),
but you still go around in circles.
One of the strongest
proponents of the ABM system is
a friend of mine who has been
assigned by the Pentagon to
convince skeptics like myself that
we really need an ABM system.
Since they have no funds yet, I
bought him a drink.
"I don't think I could make a
stronger argument for the ABM,"
he said, "than the fact that
Secretary Laird has revealed the
Soviets will have a first-strike
nuclear capability by 1975."
"That's pretty strong," I
admitted. "But how come
Secretary Laird found out about
this first-strike Soviet capability
and Secretaries McNamara and
Clifford knew nothing about it?"
"Laird reads more."
Reasoning
"Look, a few months ago you
told me that the reason we needed
an ABM system was to protect
our cities from Soviet missiles.
Then you said it was to protect
our cities from Red Chinese
missiles. After that, you said it
was impossible to protect the
cities so we had to protect our
missile launching sites. Now you
say we need it because the Soviets
are building new first-strike
missiles. Why don't you make up
your mind?"
"Actually, it's a little of this
and a little of that,' he said,
unperturbed. "We know we need
the system, but we're still not
quite sure what we need it for. It
has many uses.
"For example, the Soviets are
building an ABM system
Moscow. Now we know it doesn't
work, but we're not certain the
Soviets know it doesn't work. So
if we build an ABM system,
they'll find out ours doesn't work,
and then they'll have to assume
their system doesn't work either."
"I get it," I said excitedly. "If
we didn't have an ABM system,
the Soviets might put too much
value on the one they have."
"Righto. Now we also have to
think in terms of disarmament.
When we have a disarmament
meeting with the Soviets, we're
going to have to give up
something. Right?"
"Of course. That is what
disarmament is all about,"

"We don't want to give up
something that could endanger
the security of the country, so, if
we have the ABM system, we can
give that up instead. Of course, if
we didn't have an ABM system for
disarmament purposes, we'd have
to invent one."
He continued:
"I know there are many
scientists and Nobel Prize winners
who are attacking the system, but
what they don't realize is that if
they say the system won't work,
the Soviets will be encouraged to
go ahead with their offensive
missiles, and the more missiles
they stockpile the more they will

be encouraged to try a first
strike."
"But why?"
"Because Secretary Laird says
so."
"What about the cost?"

about when you mention the
