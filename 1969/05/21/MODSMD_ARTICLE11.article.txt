## Morotpsycho Nightmare Revisited 
### Bob Zimmerman 
I was plodding through the
campus, weary from a class
When by a familiar building I just
chanced to pass
My weariness evaporated on this
site I knew so well
And happily I headed for good
old AEL
I was standing on the steps of this
dark and quiet lab
Thinking of my office couch
where 40 winks I'd grab
When out pops a student, he must
have thought I was canned
He immediately shoved a leaflet
right into my hand
I right away fell down onto my
bended knee
Saying "I dig causes, but please
don't involve me"
He opened up his Mao and began
to shout "Are you that concerned
Trustee I heard about?"
I said "No, no, no, I'm a professor
and it's true
I'm an active liberal, and been to
grad school, too"
When out steps his chick, her
name was Mello
She looked like she just ran out of
I Am Curious (Yellow)
I immediately tried to cool it with
her kook

By telling him what a nice moral
stand he took
He said, "What do faculty know
of morality, pray tell?"
I said I had come to sleep in AEL
Well, by the growth 'neath my
chin, I guess he knew I wouldn't
lie
He said "I guess you're alienated,"
he said it kind of sly
"Oh yes" I said "10,000 papers
today I wrote"
He said "I have a bed for you
under the injunction note
Just one demand and you can go
to sleep right now
That you don't touch the printing
press and in the morning picket
Dow."
I was sleeping like a liberal when I
heard something chimin'
There stood Mello looking just
like Richard Lyman
She said "Come to a rap session,
I'll show you to the door"
I said "O, no, no, I've been
through this joint before."
I knew I had to split, but I did not
know how
When she said would you like to
have some grass right now
Well, I couldn't leave unless the
students threw me out

'Cause I'd already promised to
picket Dow
I had to say something to strike
up hostile banter
So I yelled "I like Hayakawa and
his Tarn O'Shanter!"
Mello acted stoned, but got out of
the way
As he came out of their sleeping
bag, yelling "What's that I heard
you say?"
I said "I like Hayakawa, I think
you heard me right"
Then I closed my ears as he
educated me with all his might
Mello mumbled something 'bout
she had another date
As his fist was raised up in the air,
said he's escalate
to SRI, if I didn't promptly renig
You undemocratic, rotten faculty
fascist pig
He threw a Peninsula Observer at
me as I did look
I headed for a window as I seen
his grab his books
I somersaulted out the window
with an academic groan
And landed fully skewered on the
People's Microphone
Mello yelled come back, as he
started to preach,

The sun was coming up, as I went }
running off to teach
Me I haven't been back there in
quite a spell
Even though Mello graduated and
got a job with Tel & Tel
He still sits in White Plaza looking
out for me
He wants to turn me in to the
AFT
While me I gas and spray, thankful
as I spray
Without freedom of research, I'd
have to work for CIA

I had to say something to strike
up hostile banter
So I yelled "I like Hayakawa and
his Tarn O'Shanter!"
Mello acted stoned, but got out of
the way
As he came out of their sleeping
bag, yelling "What's that I heard
you say?"
I said "I like Hayakawa, I think
you heard me right"
Then I closed my ears as he
educated me with all his might
Mello mumbled something 'bout
she had another date
As his fist was raised up in the air,
said he's escalate
to SRI, if I didn't promptly renig
You undemocratic, rotten faculty
fascist pig
He threw a Peninsula Observer at
me as I did look
I headed for a window as I seen
his grab his books
I somersaulted out the window
with an academic groan
And landed fully skewered on the
People's Microphone
Mello yelled come back, as he
started to preach,

The sun was coming up, as I went }
running off to teach
Me I haven't been back there in
quite a spell
Even though Mello graduated and
got a job with Tel & Tel
He still sits in White Plaza looking
out for me
He wants to turn me in to the
AFT
While me I gas and spray, thankful
as I spray
Without freedom of research, I'd
have to work for CIA

I was plodding through the
campus, weary from a class
When by a familiar building I just
chanced to pass
My weariness evaporated on this
site I knew so well
And happily I headed for good
old AEL
I was standing on the steps of this
dark and quiet lab
Thinking of my office couch
where 40 winks I'd grab
When out pops a student, he must
have thought I was canned
He immediately shoved a leaflet
right into my hand
I right away fell down onto my
bended knee
Saying "I dig causes, but please
don't involve me"
He opened up his Mao and began
to shout "Are you that concerned
Trustee I heard about?"
I said "No, no, no, I'm a professor
and it's true
I'm an active liberal, and been to
grad school, too"
When out steps his chick, her
name was Mello
She looked like she just ran out of
I Am Curious (Yellow)
I immediately tried to cool it with
her kook

By telling him what a nice moral
stand he took
He said, "What do faculty know
of morality, pray tell?"
I said I had come to sleep in AEL
Well, by the growth 'neath my
chin, I guess he knew I wouldn't
lie
He said "I guess you're alienated,"
he said it kind of sly
"Oh yes" I said "10,000 papers
today I wrote"
He said "I have a bed for you
under the injunction note
Just one demand and you can go
to sleep right now
That you don't touch the printing
press and in the morning picket
Dow."
I was sleeping like a liberal when I
heard something chimin'
There stood Mello looking just
like Richard Lyman
She said "Come to a rap session,
I'll show you to the door"
I said "O, no, no, I've been
through this joint before."
I knew I had to split, but I did not
know how
When she said would you like to
have some grass right now
Well, I couldn't leave unless the
students threw me out

'Cause I'd already promised to
picket Dow
I had to say something to strike
up hostile banter
So I yelled "I like Hayakawa and
his Tarn O'Shanter!"
Mello acted stoned, but got out of
the way
As he came out of their sleeping
bag, yelling "What's that I heard
you say?"
I said "I like Hayakawa, I think
you heard me right"
