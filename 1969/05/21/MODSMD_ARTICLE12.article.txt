# An Open Letter To Nixon
## Vietnam: Still The Main Issue 
### Allan Smith 
Dear President Nixon:
It would be an understatement
to say that many Americans are
becoming alienated from the
policies of the federal
government. It is no coincidence
that many of these people are to
be found at the nation's colleges
and universities, where the spirit
of inquiry and critical evaluation
is emphasized. For what is in
question in the minds of these
people is the credibility of the
federal government's
pronouncements and policies.
Speaking as a member of this
alienated group, I must say I am
deeply distressed by the recent
proposal you have made for peace
in Vietnam. Its fundamental
assumptions fly in the face of
everything I have been able to
learn about the history of the
Vietnamese war.
I have used the word
''alienated" because my
disagreement with public policy is
at the level of basic assumptions.
My sense of frustration over
Vietnam stems not from the wish
for a more practical response to
the official analysis of the conflict
there, but from an altogether
different understanding of what is
going on in that conflict.
Let me try to explain. Your
proposal for a bilateral withdrawal
of troops by North Vietnam and
the United States betrays your
acceptance of President Johnson's
view of the war as a simple case of
"aggression from the North." I do
not see how this view can be
reconciled with the fact that both
the National Liberation Front and
the war itself started in the South.
I have heard it argued that the
insurgency in the South was
masterminded by Hanoi. But
considering the nature of the
Saigon government in the South, I
do not find this line of argument
very persuasive.

It is common knowledge that
Diem's regime flagrantly violated
the Geneva agreements, refused to
institute much needed land
reforms, and conducted a vicious
campaign of political persecution
and repression. In light of this, the
theory that Hanoi was responsible
for southern insurgency does not
even make sense.
Failure
I am very much upset by the
failure of American policy-makers
to publicly acknowledge the
nature and origin of the Saigon
government. I have heard our
officials berate Diem, years after
his death, for his mismanagement
of the Saigon regime; but I have
yet to hear anyone admit that
that regime was a continuation of
the old colonial government
sponsored by the French, which
suffered defeat by the Viet Minh
in 1954.
Nor is it admitted that the
United States was implicated with
Diem in his refusal to permit
national elections in 1956, though
it has since become apparent that
the Eisenhower Administration
supported Diem in this move. In
light of this, how is it possible for
the United States to continue to
support the Saigon regime? How
is it possible for us to invoke the
Geneva Accords of 1954, when
we have been in continual
violation of those accords?
Your proposal represents a
clear-cut acceptance of South
Vietnam as a separate nation from
North Vietnam, and of the Saigon
government as the legitimate
government of South Vietnam.
Both these principles are in direct
conflict with the Geneva
agreements. Further, your
proposal indicates that the United
States will not back down from its
commitment to South Vietnam.
To whom, please, was this

commitment made? Was it not to
the Saigon government, which the
United States has supported and
kept in power ever since 1954??
Tyrannical
Aside from its illegitimacy with
respect to the Geneva agreements,
I have not seen one shred of
evidence that this is a
representative government
established by the people of
Vietnam. On the contrary, it has
every appearance of being a
tyrannical regime imposed on
South Vietnam from above, that
is, by the Old Vietnamese
aristocracy in collaboration with
the United States. How does this
square with the principle of
self-determinism we are supposed
to be defending?
It seems clear to me that the
American aim of establishing a
pro-West regime on the ruins of
the old colonial government in
Vietnam is fundamentally
ill-conceived and immoral. I
cannot accept the idea that
everything the United States has
done in Vietnam is justified by
the fact that our enemies happen
to be Communists. First, I think
there is ample evidence that the
government of South Vietnam has
been far less popular and less
successful than the Communist
government of North Vietnam.

Second, 1 object to the idea that
America is justified in using the
same undemocratic and deceitful
procedures it claims to be
campaigning against.
Mr. President, I call for you to
publicly explain why you think
the goals the United States has set
for itself in Vietnam are
legitimate. I would like to know
what right the United States has
to inhibit the carrying out of the
Geneva Accords by continuing to
offer massive military aid to the
Saigon Government.
How can you expect American
men to go to Vietnam and fight
for a cause which is repugnant to
our own anti-colonialist heritage?
Unless answers to these issues are
forthcoming, we who have raised
them will have no choice but to
resort to more and more desperate
means of expressing our dissent
from the American policy in
Vietnam.
