# Guest Column
## Is There No Room For A Middle Course? 
### Jerry Snow 
The politics of frustration have
rounded a corner of sorts.
Anti-SRI demonstrations have
temporarily moved off campus
and directly to the object of
frustration. The demonstrators
blocked traffic, broke windows,
and engaged police in a running
battle. This was considered a
major victory. A victory! But for
whom?
The other day I received a card
from a Stanford alumnus ('27) in
response to an earlier column I
wrote for the Daily concerning
the Encina fiasco. This alum took
the occasion to express his
feelings against the "SDS, BSU,
Black Panthers, A3M et al,"
stating that a "massive reaction in
profound depth is taking place
against" these organizations,
"from the White House on down.
Alumni financial contributions are
being cut off from campuses
involved in riots. Lists of students
(and non-student) radicals are

being compiled by governmental
and private agencies. Campus
recruiters scrutinize lists of
radicals to prevent future
employment. 'Amnesty' is not in
the dictionary as George Orwell's
'1984' gallops back to 1974." He
may glory and gloat in these
vindictive, Orwelliam visions, but
they frighten me. Keeping the
police occupied: a victory? Only
the fascists of the right and the
fascists of the left stand to gain
from the increasing turmoil and
confusion—and not even they,
ultimately. And in the meantime,
the rest of us are being herded
towards the cliff.
There must be an incredible
streak of blindness in the radical
movement—either that, or
incredible arrogance. (I'm not
suggesting, of course, that the
radical movement has a monopoly
on blindness or arrogance, any
more than they do on morality.)
There may be genuine cause for

outrage on the part of the
Berkeley street people, or on the
part of the anti-war demonstrators
at Stanford, but their provocation
of police action frightens me even
more than the thing they are
protesting against. I fear fascism
and unreason running through my
streets at home far more than a
misdirected foreign policy abroad.
In the quiet of our minds, we
all need to ask ourselves one
question: do we really believe that
every other way has been tried,
that everything humanly possible
has been done, short of violence,
to affect university policy, to
influence the Trustees, or just to
present the case for peace and a
just society to the community?
Can we deny or overlook the
positive changes that are and have
been forthcoming, even if they
come too slowly to suit us? I
submit that significant change is
forthcoming, that there are a
thousand peaceful ways yet

untried to improve society and its
institutions.
Repression
Anarchy is such an emphatic
evil and totalitarian repression is
right next to it. Yet those who
resort to violence and disrespect
of law are one of the most
immediate causes of the spectre of
political repression that has begun
to haunt this country, a repression
that will sweep all of us
indiscriminately before it. Witness
the undifferentiated police attacks
on A3M members, whether girls,
or on the medical committee, or
even just innocent bystanders who
got a little too close; but witness
also the senseless baiting of
authority that brought it on, the
rock throwing, the defiance. Civil
dissidents cannot dissociate
themselves from the consequences
of their actions. One must be
blind not to see this, or extremely
arrogant to ignore it."I think
these kids probably have a point
to make," said one motorist at
SRI Hanover, "but they're killing
the cause in making it." And a lot
else besides.
What I want is a way to express
the sympathy and oneness that I
feel with my aggrieved generation
of youth without cutting myself
off from the rest of society. After
all, I too believe in a better world,
my ideals are as high, my dreams
as ambitious as anyone's in the
A3M. And I know what it is to
have to work for these ideals, I
know how frustrating and slow it
can be to try to persuade people

of the rightness of something with
only ideals and personal
conviction, through love and not
coercion. I spent several years in
Germany as a Mormon missionary
working at just this kind of thing.
And politics, in this respect, is not
that different from religion. I
learned that the only way to
influence a person to change his
mind about something is not to
burn his house down, but to build
a better one next door and invite
him to move in.
In practical politics, this means
a way of moderation, a
middle-of-the-roadism that runs
the risk of offending both sides.
At a time when both the campus
and the nation arejackknifing up
the middle and people are being
thrown right and left over the
volatile issues being decided, at a
time when everyone is choosing
up sides and no one wants to walk
the dangerous in between, may
the voice of moderation, perhaps
the least wanted, not meekly bow
out—not now, when it is most
needed. There is where the real
challenge of both morality and
politics is found: in the painful,
time consuming search for viable
third alternatives, in the effort to
serve the best and highest interests
of the greatest number of people,
in the honest confrontation of
reality for the sake of
accomplishing the possible.
Moderation, in short, is least of all
what it is sometimes called: a
cop-out.

For example, was there no way
to be against war research, yet not
have to participate in the class
boycott that symbolized support
for the ASM as well? Is there no
way to disagree with the Trustees,
yet continue to respect them as
human beings, without being
considered ''catatonic,"
"mindless," or a traitor? Is there
no way to stand up in courageous
opposition to ideas without
dehumanizing one's opponents, as
was done on White Plaza last week
(all cops are pigs; Trustees as men
are no more than the sum of their
business associations)? Is there no
way to work for a better future
without having to destroy the
present in the process? I mean,
yes there is another way, but so
very often the choice is structured
as though there weren't.
The world has got to change,
granted, the Trustees ought to be
more genuinely responsive and
progressive, universities have a
long road of reform ahead, society
is sick and getting sicker, and I'm
not going to just sit down and
watch it happen. No, I want some
of the things that the A3M and
the SDS want too, but I'm
determined to seek them another
way. Reason, moderation,
patience, dedication, even at the
cost of frustration, long suffering,
and much lost time—this is the
only way to get where we're all
trying to go and still have
something left when we get there.

off from the rest of society. After
all, I too believe in a better world,
my ideals are as high, my dreams
as ambitious as anyone's in the
A3M. And I know what it is to
have to work for these ideals, I
know how frustrating and slow it
can be to try to persuade people

of the rightness of something with
only ideals and personal
conviction, through love and not
coercion. I spent several years in
Germany as a Mormon missionary
working at just this kind of thing.
And politics, in this respect, is not
that different from religion. I
learned that the only way to
influence a person to change his
mind about something is not to
burn his house down, but to build
a better one next door and invite
him to move in.
In practical politics, this means
a way of moderation, a
middle-of-the-roadism that runs
the risk of offending both sides.
At a time when both the campus
and the nation arejackknifing up
the middle and people are being
thrown right and left over the
volatile issues being decided, at a
time when everyone is choosing
up sides and no one wants to walk
the dangerous in between, may
the voice of moderation, perhaps
the least wanted, not meekly bow
out—not now, when it is most
needed. There is where the real
challenge of both morality and
politics is found: in the painful,
time consuming search for viable
third alternatives, in the effort to
serve the best and highest interests
of the greatest number of people,
in the honest confrontation of
reality for the sake of
accomplishing the possible.
Moderation, in short, is least of all
what it is sometimes called: a
cop-out.

For example, was there no way
to be against war research, yet not
have to participate in the class
boycott that symbolized support
for the ASM as well? Is there no
way to disagree with the Trustees,
yet continue to respect them as
human beings, without being
considered ''catatonic,"
"mindless," or a traitor? Is there
no way to stand up in courageous
opposition to ideas without
dehumanizing one's opponents, as
was done on White Plaza last week
(all cops are pigs; Trustees as men
are no more than the sum of their
business associations)? Is there no
way to work for a better future
without having to destroy the
present in the process? I mean,
yes there is another way, but so
very often the choice is structured
as though there weren't.
The world has got to change,
granted, the Trustees ought to be
more genuinely responsive and
progressive, universities have a
long road of reform ahead, society
is sick and getting sicker, and I'm
not going to just sit down and
watch it happen. No, I want some
of the things that the A3M and
the SDS want too, but I'm
determined to seek them another
way. Reason, moderation,
patience, dedication, even at the
cost of frustration, long suffering,
and much lost time—this is the
only way to get where we're all
trying to go and still have
something left when we get there.

The politics of frustration have
rounded a corner of sorts.
Anti-SRI demonstrations have
temporarily moved off campus
and directly to the object of
frustration. The demonstrators
blocked traffic, broke windows,
and engaged police in a running
battle. This was considered a
major victory. A victory! But for
whom?
The other day I received a card
from a Stanford alumnus ('27) in
response to an earlier column I
wrote for the Daily concerning
the Encina fiasco. This alum took
the occasion to express his
feelings against the "SDS, BSU,
Black Panthers, A3M et al,"
stating that a "massive reaction in
profound depth is taking place
against" these organizations,
"from the White House on down.
Alumni financial contributions are
being cut off from campuses
involved in riots. Lists of students
(and non-student) radicals are

being compiled by governmental
and private agencies. Campus
recruiters scrutinize lists of
radicals to prevent future
employment. 'Amnesty' is not in
the dictionary as George Orwell's
'1984' gallops back to 1974." He
may glory and gloat in these
vindictive, Orwelliam visions, but
they frighten me. Keeping the
police occupied: a victory? Only
the fascists of the right and the
fascists of the left stand to gain
from the increasing turmoil and
confusion—and not even they,
ultimately. And in the meantime,
the rest of us are being herded
towards the cliff.
There must be an incredible
streak of blindness in the radical
movement—either that, or
incredible arrogance. (I'm not
suggesting, of course, that the
radical movement has a monopoly
on blindness or arrogance, any
more than they do on morality.)
There may be genuine cause for

outrage on the part of the
Berkeley street people, or on the
part of the anti-war demonstrators
at Stanford, but their provocation
of police action frightens me even
more than the thing they are
protesting against. I fear fascism
and unreason running through my
streets at home far more than a
misdirected foreign policy abroad.
In the quiet of our minds, we
all need to ask ourselves one
question: do we really believe that
every other way has been tried,
that everything humanly possible
has been done, short of violence,
to affect university policy, to
influence the Trustees, or just to
present the case for peace and a
just society to the community?
Can we deny or overlook the
positive changes that are and have
been forthcoming, even if they
come too slowly to suit us? I
submit that significant change is
forthcoming, that there are a
thousand peaceful ways yet

untried to improve society and its
institutions.
Repression
Anarchy is such an emphatic
evil and totalitarian repression is
right next to it. Yet those who
resort to violence and disrespect
of law are one of the most
immediate causes of the spectre of
political repression that has begun
to haunt this country, a repression
that will sweep all of us
indiscriminately before it. Witness
the undifferentiated police attacks
on A3M members, whether girls,
or on the medical committee, or
even just innocent bystanders who
got a little too close; but witness
also the senseless baiting of
authority that brought it on, the
rock throwing, the defiance. Civil
dissidents cannot dissociate
themselves from the consequences
of their actions. One must be
blind not to see this, or extremely
arrogant to ignore it."I think
these kids probably have a point
to make," said one motorist at
SRI Hanover, "but they're killing
the cause in making it." And a lot
else besides.
What I want is a way to express
the sympathy and oneness that I
feel with my aggrieved generation
of youth without cutting myself
off from the rest of society. After

stating that a "massive reaction in

Alumni financial contributions are
being cut off from campuses

confusion—and not even they,

There must be an incredible
streak of blindness in the radical
movement—either that, or
incredible arrogance. (I'm not
suggesting, of course, that the
radical movement has a monopoly
on blindness or arrogance, any
more than they do on morality.)
There may be genuine cause for

outrage on the part of the
Berkeley street people, or on the
part of the anti-war demonstrators
at Stanford, but their provocation
of police action frightens me even
more than the thing they are
protesting against. I fear fascism
and unreason running through my
streets at home far more than a
misdirected foreign policy abroad.
In the quiet of our minds, we
all need to ask ourselves one
question: do we really believe that
every other way has been tried,
that everything humanly possible
has been done, short of violence,
to affect university policy, to
influence the Trustees, or just to
present the case for peace and a
just society to the community?
Can we deny or overlook the
positive changes that are and have
been forthcoming, even if they
come too slowly to suit us? I
submit that significant change is
forthcoming, that there are a
thousand peaceful ways yet

untried to improve society and its
institutions.
Repression
Anarchy is such an emphatic
evil and totalitarian repression is
right next to it. Yet those who
resort to violence and disrespect
of law are one of the most
immediate causes of the spectre of
political repression that has begun
to haunt this country, a repression
that will sweep all of us
indiscriminately before it. Witness
the undifferentiated police attacks
on A3M members, whether girls,
or on the medical committee, or
even just innocent bystanders who
got a little too close; but witness
also the senseless baiting of
authority that brought it on, the
rock throwing, the defiance. Civil
dissidents cannot dissociate
themselves from the consequences
of their actions. One must be
blind not to see this, or extremely
arrogant to ignore it."I think
these kids probably have a point
to make," said one motorist at
SRI Hanover, "but they're killing
the cause in making it." And a lot
else besides.
What I want is a way to express
the sympathy and oneness that I
feel with my aggrieved generation
of youth without cutting myself
off from the rest of society. After
all, I too believe in a better world,
my ideals are as high, my dreams
as ambitious as anyone's in the
A3M. And I know what it is to
have to work for these ideals, I
know how frustrating and slow it
can be to try to persuade people

of the rightness of something with
only ideals and personal
conviction, through love and not
coercion. I spent several years in
Germany as a Mormon missionary
working at just this kind of thing.
And politics, in this respect, is not
that different from religion. I
learned that the only way to
influence a person to change his
mind about something is not to
burn his house down, but to build
a better one next door and invite
him to move in.
In practical politics, this means
a way of moderation, a
middle-of-the-roadism that runs
the risk of offending both sides.
At a time when both the campus
and the nation arejackknifing up
the middle and people are being
thrown right and left over the
volatile issues being decided, at a
time when everyone is choosing
up sides and no one wants to walk
the dangerous in between, may
the voice of moderation, perhaps
the least wanted, not meekly bow
out—not now, when it is most
needed. There is where the real
challenge of both morality and
politics is found: in the painful,
time consuming search for viable
third alternatives, in the effort to
serve the best and highest interests
of the greatest number of people,
in the honest confrontation of
reality for the sake of
accomplishing the possible.
Moderation, in short, is least of all
what it is sometimes called: a
cop-out.

For example, was there no way
to be against war research, yet not
have to participate in the class
boycott that symbolized support
for the ASM as well? Is there no
way to disagree with the Trustees,
yet continue to respect them as
human beings, without being
considered ''catatonic,"
"mindless," or a traitor? Is there
no way to stand up in courageous
opposition to ideas without
dehumanizing one's opponents, as
was done on White Plaza last week
(all cops are pigs; Trustees as men
are no more than the sum of their
business associations)? Is there no
way to work for a better future
without having to destroy the
present in the process? I mean,
yes there is another way, but so
very often the choice is structured
as though there weren't.
The world has got to change,
granted, the Trustees ought to be
more genuinely responsive and
progressive, universities have a
long road of reform ahead, society
is sick and getting sicker, and I'm
not going to just sit down and
watch it happen. No, I want some
of the things that the A3M and
the SDS want too, but I'm
determined to seek them another
way. Reason, moderation,
patience, dedication, even at the
cost of frustration, long suffering,
and much lost time—this is the
only way to get where we're all
trying to go and still have
something left when we get there.
(Jerry Snow is a senior Knglisli
major-Ed.)
The politics of frustration have
rounded a corner of sorts.
Anti-SRI demonstrations have
temporarily moved off campus
and directly to the object of
frustration. The demonstrators
blocked traffic, broke windows,
and engaged police in a running
battle. This was considered a
major victory. A victory! But for
whom?
The other day I received a card
from a Stanford alumnus ('27) in
response to an earlier column I
wrote for the Daily concerning
the Encina fiasco. This alum took
the occasion to express his
feelings against the "SDS, BSU,
Black Panthers, A3M et al,"
stating that a "massive reaction in
profound depth is taking place

learned that the only way to
influence a person to change his
mind about something is not to
burn his house down, but to build
a better one next door and invite
him to move in.
In practical politics, this means
a way of moderation, a
middle-of-the-roadism that runs
the risk of offending both sides.
At a time when both the campus
and the nation arejackknifing up
the middle and people are being
thrown right and left over the
volatile issues being decided, at a
time when everyone is choosing
up sides and no one wants to walk
the dangerous in between, may
the voice of moderation, perhaps
the least wanted, not meekly bow
out—not now, when it is most
needed. There is where the real
challenge of both morality and
politics is found: in the painful,
time consuming search for viable
third alternatives, in the effort to
serve the best and highest interests
of the greatest number of people,
in the honest confrontation of
reality for the sake of
accomplishing the possible.
Moderation, in short, is least of all
what it is sometimes called: a
cop-out.

For example, was there no way
to be against war research, yet not
have to participate in the class
boycott that symbolized support
for the ASM as well? Is there no
way to disagree with the Trustees,
yet continue to respect them as
human beings, without being
considered ''catatonic,"
"mindless," or a traitor? Is there
no way to stand up in courageous
opposition to ideas without
dehumanizing one's opponents, as
was done on White Plaza last week
(all cops are pigs; Trustees as men
are no more than the sum of their
business associations)? Is there no
way to work for a better future
without having to destroy the
present in the process? I mean,
yes there is another way, but so
very often the choice is structured
as though there weren't.
The world has got to change,
granted, the Trustees ought to be
more genuinely responsive and
progressive, universities have a
long road of reform ahead, society
is sick and getting sicker, and I'm
not going to just sit down and
watch it happen. No, I want some
of the things that the A3M and
the SDS want too, but I'm
determined to seek them another
way. Reason, moderation,
patience, dedication, even at the
cost of frustration, long suffering,
and much lost time—this is the
only way to get where we're all
trying to go and still have
something left when we get there.
