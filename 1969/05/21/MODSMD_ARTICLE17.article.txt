## "Morals Committee" Needed 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I have never been so shocked in
all my life! As I was walking on
White Plaza I noticed a
"Committee for an Academic
Community" poster. Someone
had added an extra "A" on to the
initials of CAC. As anyone knows,
Caca is Italian for shit.
This kind of indecency must
stop. Even if we have to bring
police onto the campus, our
public facilities must be
protected. If the University
cannot prevent such intolerable
occurances I think outside forces
of justice and order should be
utilized.
I mean, you can imagine my
embarrassment. What if my
mother had been with me? What
would I have said? I really don't
know what this world is coming
to.
To solve this problem, I
propose that we form the
"Committee for the Dictation of
Morals." This committee would
consist of five elected alumni
representatives, five individuals
chosen by the Stanford faculty,
and five chosen by the Student
Body. This board would hear and
judge accusations, individuals
accused of being basically
immoral and a detriment to the
community. Anyone may bring
another before this board; not
only students would be subject to
the board, but faculty,
administration, and Trustees alike.
By this method, Stanford can
hopefully return to the good old
days of peace and tranquility, and
at the same time rid this campus
of that type of moral degenerate
who would defecate the campus
with foul language.

•Don't Abolish
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a March 26 memo to the
Stanford Today Editorial Advisory
Board, a faculty-student
committee which advises general
policies for the magazine Stanford
Today, President Pitzer
announced that the Summer 1969
issue of Stanford Today would be
the last, and that the publication
would be discontinued because of
"the stringent budget situation."
Since that time the committee has
appealed the decision, pointing
out the unique position and
excellent reputation of Stanford
Today in the community. In a
letter of May 9 to Professor
McKim, committee chairman,
Pitzer stated that this cut "seemed
an advisable reduction in contrast
to others linked directly to the
academic life of the University."
For alumni and others not
directly connected to Stanford
who receive'this publication, it is
the only link with the academic
life of the University. The
Stanford Observer presents the
political news, the honors and
appointments, and other news
items indirectly aimed at
stimulating alums to reach for
their checkbooks. To find out
about research accomplishments
and discoveries, alumni have to

depend on the popular press and
occasional short mentions in the
Observer. Stanford Today is the
only scholarly publication sent to
alumni. How else would they
learn of work on the Artifical
Intelligence Project, or of the
radio-telescope and other work
which would assure them that the
University is progressing and not
disintegrating, as they might feel
if they heard only of disruptions
and sit-ins?
Because of the valuable
public-relations functions served
by Stanford Today, and because
of its editorial excellence, I ask
the community to support me in
my request that Stanford Today
not be abolished.

• Clarification
Editor, THE PEOPLE'S DAILY:
The CAC is always grateful for
whatever concessions are granted
it by the professional staff of our
campus paper, and, indeed, the
CAC appreciates the appearance
of its latest statement on the
activities in the industrial park.
But it come as somewhat of a
surprise to find this statement
under the heading "RIGHT'S
RESPONSE," along with a
statmeent from YAF.
It should seem apparent by its
past program that the CAC is not
a member of "The Community of
the Right." This is pointed out
not as a slight to the YAF and
YR's, but rather to distinguish the
CAC from that which it is not.
It has been suggested that
those in sympathy with the A3M
would try to label all opposition
as being "right wing;" thus
capitalizing on some shreds of
bigotry which yet exist on this
campus. But given the objective
nature of the Daily, the caption
must certainly have been an
oversight.
The CAC is made up of
Democrats, YAF'ers,
McCarthyites, and Republicans.
Its policies have been moderate
and its programs have been, and
will be, progressive. Its
membership has pledged to work
for positive change through

rational discussion, persuasion and
presentation of facts, and to work
against the use of violence and
intimidation in the settling of
University affairs. Surely this
statement in compatible with a
wide range of political
persuasions.

•The Real Issue
Editor, THE DAILY:
The people at SRI
(a) are doing immoral research
(b) are inhuman
(c) are not human beings
(d) should be killed.
Last Wednesday at the
Memorial Church meeting of the
A3M a speaker said the workers at
SRI "are not human beings." j
Another speaker later attempted
to comment on the statement, but '
he was stopped and told to speak
only on the issue at hand.

•An Answer
Editor, THE DAILY:
To help our students
understand and solve some of
their difficulties, I am offering
them two topics for their
consideration.
1) The Ideal and the Real. We
have been frustrated for at least
2500 years by the gap between
what we know to be right and
what we are willing and able to
do. This applies not only to the
Establishment but also to its
enemies. Read Plato and St.
Augustine.
2) Word and Deed. Our
civilization is based on the belief
in the efficacy of the human
word, of human reason. To
advocate violence is to deny this
efficacy. Let us not do it, even if
we do not get things our way.
