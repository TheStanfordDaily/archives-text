A major break-through in
Soviet-American relations—the
first student-initiated and totally
student-run cultural exchange
program between the two
countries -is soon to appear on
the Stanford campus.
Initiated and headed by Mike
Gilfix, the program is open to all
students interested in
participating in the exchange of
photoexhibitions, art shows, and
creative efforts in literature and
music. The first meeting will be
held tonight at 7 :30 p.m. in Rm.
270 of TMU.
Student-to-Student
The idea for purely
student-to-student (as opposed to
government-to-student) exchanges
of letters, art or photos was at

first rejected by the Soviet
Embassy in Washington, which
stated that all such programs are
handled by the State Department
only.
Cautious encouragement from
other sources eventually resulted
in referral to the World Youth
Organization in Moscow, which
Gilfix contacted last September.
A positive reply from the
Student Council of the USSR was
received after a six-month delay.
Specifically, they accepted two
of the proposals-an exchange of
photo exhibitions in which
student life is to be depicted, and
a letter exchange program
(glorified pen pals). They also
expressed a desire to expand to
several other ideas.
Photos Soon
The photos are expected to
arrive soon. Meanwhile, Gilfix's
group are working to develop an
accurate and representative
photographic illustration of
student life at Stanford.
Students willing to work on
this project are needed, as well as
someone skilled in the art of
distilling vodka—or, for the more
conventional, anyone who would
like to write in English or in
Russian to a Soviet student.
"It is especially important that
we find interested students who
will be at Stanford over the
summer to keep up
communication with the Soviet
Union," urges Gilfix.
"We are also doing a great deal
of organizing for next year, so
students who will be here next

year are particularly encouraged
to attend."
The group hopes to expand the
program to a Stanford-Moscow
University exchange, involving
only students of these
institutions, while the ultimate
goal is the establishment of an
undergraduate student exchange.
The few exchange students
now here are almost exclusively at
the graduate level.
Gilfix' idea was born when he
was in the Soviet Union in the
summer of 1967 with a University
of Michigan study tour and
became good friends with a
number of Soviet students.
"After returning to the US, I
began thinking about ways to
work for greater understanding
and communication between
students with common concerns
and interests who just happen to
be studying in different
countries," states Gilfix.
Other projects in the
developing stages include a book
exchange in which student
concerns and protrayals will be
emphasized,
A library to collect items
ranging from pins from the Soviet
Union to catalogues of Soviet
literature and publications is also
planned.
Anyone who is interested but
unable to attend tonight's meeting
is asked to call Mike Gilfix at
328-2838, Mike Heathman at

327-2920 ext. 422. Names may
also be left in their mailbox in the
ASSU office.
