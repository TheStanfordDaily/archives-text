The picture of Davie Napier which
appeared on the photo page of
Monday's Daily was eontextually
misplaced. Surrounding photos all
showed activities of the April 3rd
Movement on Friday morning when
members blockaded roads leading to the
SRI offices on Hanover Street in the
Industrial Park. The picture of Napier
was not taken on Friday. It was shot in
February during a noon rally in White
Plaza.
The Daily regrets the erroneous
impression presented of Napier's
association with Friday's activities at
SRI-Hanover.
