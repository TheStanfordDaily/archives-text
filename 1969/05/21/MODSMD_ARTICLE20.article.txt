# 19-Ajax-69

### 
The Water Ensemble, the
drama group which last May
performed the controversial play
"Tom Paine" at Stanford, returns
this week with "19-Ajax-69," a
new free verse adaptation by
Richard G. Geldard of Sophocles'
tragedy.
The Department of Speech and
Drama production, under the
direction of Robert P. Walter, will
be performed at 8 p.m. May 21-24
in Frost Amphitheater at
Stanford. Since there will be no
regular seating, the audience is
advised to bring their own
blankets.
"19-Ajax-69" is the story of
one man's struggle to make
independently the decisions which
control his own destiny. Until he
alone can define his life without
the interference of a bureaucratic
society, he is not a total man.
Walter is a first-year master of
fine arts student. A playwright as
well as a director, he has had
several of his plays produced
around the country including off
off-Broadway. Geldard is a Ph.D.
candidate in drama. He directed
Euripides' "Cyclops" last quarter.
"I can't tolerate an historical
resurrection for its own sake,"
said Walter. "Today, the theatrical
experience must unlock every
possible avenue of expression. We
have moved beyond the logical
and scientific barrier of the word
and use the media of today.
Theater must reach out and touch
all our senses."
"19-Ajax-69" is programmed
for "sound, sight, and humanity."
Atonal music composed by
freshmen Hugh John McCarten
and John Carney employs jazz
rhythms, the 12-tone scale, and
four and eight part harmony.
Choreography is by Barbara
Epmeier and Becky Daniels.
Walter has also designed
costumes which leave "little
between the actors and the
audience." In using some nudity
in the production, Walter hopes
the audience will realize that
"underneath, we all are naked, all
the same.
"Nudity in itself should not
matter one way or another. In our
society, flesh has been used to
titillate, to obscure our humanity.
In 'Ajax' I want the audience to
say, 'So what. They're naked."
Actors in the Water Ensemble
playing major characters are Barry
Capron, Randi Douglas, Richard
Kaufman, Sally Kemp, Ricard
King, Richard M. Kite, Will
Rogers, and Chip Zempel.
