# Committee For Art Paints Tower House
## 
### 
"The Committee for Art at
Stanford cordially invites you to a
Painting Party on Saturday, May
24, from ten to five," reads the
invitation.
However, no water colors, oils,
pastels or acrylics will be used and
artistic talent is not a necessary
qualification.
The painting to be done will be
done in latex and the object is the
interior of Tower House, an
historic building on the Stanford
campus at 860 Escondido Road.
Stanford University has offered
Tower House to the Committee
for Art for use as a receiving
station and office for next year's
art sale, TREASURE MARKET
70.
The exhibi&jQ itself will be
held, as last year, in the old
Stanford Basketball Pavilion
during Stanford's spring break.

Commencing on May 27 the
office will be staffed every
Tuesday morning between 9:30
and 11:30 for those who wish to
bring in their tax-deductible
donations. Telephone 328-7149
Tuesday mornings to have a
donation picked up or call Mrs.
David Mason, 948-2903.
"All who worked on Treasure
Market 68 agree that last year's
benefit to raise money for
acquisitions to the permanent
collection of the Stanford
Museum was one of the most |
exciting, challenging and highly
successful projects ever '
undertaken on the Peninsula,"
states Jinny Reinhardt, member
of the Committee for Art.
She emphasizes that hundreds
of workers are needed and the
Treasure Market Committee
welcomes new volunteers.
