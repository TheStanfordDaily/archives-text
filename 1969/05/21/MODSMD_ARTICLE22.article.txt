At a meeting Thursday night of
the American Federation of
Teachers union local, discussion
centered on a possible TA strike, a
grievance procedure, and
University recognition of the
union.
The possibility of a strike by
Teaching Assistants was dismissed
for the time being, since only 30
union members attended
Thursday's session. Members
recognized the need for union
organizing before a strike could
seriously be considered.
After meetings this week with
the Santa Clara County Labor
Council to discuss strike
sanctions, AFT President Ed
Nelson reported that the Council
encouraged the union to go to
court in attempt to get
injunctions lifted from those TA's
cited for the Encina sit-in.
Nelson noted that strike
sanction is a secondary matter,
since "strike sanctions only back
up a successful strike. The
question is what our own strength
is, and not whether or not we
have strike sanction."
Those present expressed
indignation over the University's
refusal to recognize TA's as
employees.
