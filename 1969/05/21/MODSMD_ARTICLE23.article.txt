# History Votes Dept. Changes
## 
### 
The Department of History has
made some changes in its
requirements for the
undergraduate major. These
changes will be reflected in the
pre-registration materials available
at the History office on May 21.
Instead of requiring a basic
seminar of all majors, the
Department will require at least
one small group course, e.g. a
seminar or colloquium. Instead of
completing ten courses, majors
will be required to take twelve
History courses—no more than
two civilization courses (e.g.,
African Civilizations, East Asian
Civilizations, and Western
Civilization) may be counted
among the twelve courses.
The Department will continue
the current distribution of courses
among the three major field
groupings with at least two
courses to be taken in each field.
The Department will also
continue its current requirement
of proficiency a foreign language.
History 2 00—C om parative
studies in history—will no longer
be required of majors; but will be
made an option in the honors
program in History.
