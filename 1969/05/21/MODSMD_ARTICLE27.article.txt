# Death's Relevance Explored By Prof

Is death relevant on campus?
Or is concern about it lost in
the scramble of activities termed
"education" which fill student's
life: dates, demonstrations,
parties, studies?
Taking a statistic—suicide is
rated the second (sometimes
third) greatest cause of fatality
among the college
population—and an initial
curiosity as to whether students
actually are interested. Dr. John
Black proposed a seminar on
death six years ago.
Though some colleagues first
dubbed the idea crazy ("can you
run a course like that without
making people neurotic?"),
response was immediate. The
15-student senior colloquium,
"The Meaning of Death in
Western Culture," was filled in the
first couple hours of registration
and has since been in demand
every quarter.
"Death is the absent presence,"
explains Black, director of the
Stanford Counseling and Testing
Service and associate consulting
professor of psychology.
"It's not a topic you normally
talk about, because people are
afraid of doing so, but they are all
at some level interested and
concerned. This course offers an
opportunity to clarify your own
thinking and an excuse to discuss
it."
He has found students to be
more thoughtful than they used
to be on whether they want to go
in life, what it's all about.
"This course is one of the few
that begin to approach the basics
of a person's life," comments
student Bob Cowing. "Not
centered on arbitrary feeling or
standards, it is close to what
education should be."
The great value lies in the
low-key, student-dominated
discussion held in the relaxed
atmosphere of Black's home,
according to Susan Sward.
Students in her class ranged
from a race car driver to men
headed for Viet Nam to a
mortician.
Meeting the problem daily as a
licensed funeral director, he felt
his biggest gain was "an increasing
psychological ability to cope with
death, not only personally but
with killing."
"Our culture tends to repress
death and consequently to pay
less attention to the quality of our
lives," states Black.
More interest in death has
developed in the last six years,
which he attributes to the

continued stress of nuclear
extermination, domestic violence,
and the high incidence of
assassinations.
After an article on his class was
published in newspapers of the
San Francisco area, Black received
12 letters from inquirers,
including a nurse concerned about
handling the presence of death
and a faculty member of another
university considering whether to
offer a similar course.
Black if concerned about the
awkwardness people feel in the
presence of a dying person.
Instead of admitting it, they talk
about "silly little things" and are
robbed of the opportunity for a
meaningful interaction of feeling.
Students taking this course
are more apt to deal with death in
a more constructive fashion,"
states Black.
While discussions and reading
center on American and European
concepts of death, some Eastern
cultures and primitive rituals are
also considered.
''Our society is so
future-oriented that in order to
maintain a role in it, you have to
think as little about death as
possible," Black comments. "In
the college population, this
orientation gets still more
reinforcement—you are preparing
for the future.
One student who knew he was
living—not preparing—was a boy
who discovered just after arriving
as a freshman that he had
leukemia.
"The thing he most wanted to
do was to continue learning,
attending Stanford, which he did
until his death recently," Black
said.
This is the awareness which
leads to a higher quality of human
life which Black encourages.
Students crystallize their
opinions on public aspects such as
capital punishment, abortions,
and warfare, but are never
pressured to change them.
Thus opinions vary greatly.
"You need death," maintains
Rich Slavich. "Without it, life
would really be a drag—there
would be no force pushing you
forward."
Individual creative projects are
undertaken to express the
meaning of death. One student
composed a short cello piece of
emotional responses to death;
another took photographs of a
graveyard.
Poetry and sculpture are also
created, even by students who
have never before attempted such
work.

Individual creative projects are

Though some colleagues first
dubbed the idea crazy ("can you
run a course like that without

"This course is one of the few
that begin to approach the basics

student Bob Cowing. "Not

discussion held in the relaxed
