# Outlook Bright For Football
## 
### FRED MANN 
Last season was a big one for
the Stanford varsity football
program. They went to the pass
and came up with a potent
offense capable of scoring from
everywhere on the field. Next
year may prove to be even bigger,
and, filled with more passes. Let
all opponents be warned—the
Indians will be a definite threat
for the Rose Bowl.
Gene Washington will be gone.
Malcolm Snider and Greg Buehler
will also be gone. But so will O.J.
Simpson, Bill Enyart, Ed White,
and Steve Sogge. The Pacific-8
race for the roses will be decided
by what is remaining, and here is
where Stanford hold the upper
hand.
Coach John Ralston may get
his first free trip to Pasadena
literally "by air." The best
quarterback on the coast has
proven that his sophomore year
was no fluke. Jim Plunkett
uncorked the ball like a pro in the
three weeks of spring practice just
completed, and although
Washington won't be around to
haul them in, seven other prime
receivers will be.
Bunce Shines
It is always conforting for a
coach to be able to rely on more
than one man to carry his offense.
Ralston may be so comforted
next season he won't know what
to do. Not only is the varsity
knee-deep in fine pass catchers,
but they also own more than one
outstanding pass thrower.
Sophomore Don Bunce spent last
season as back-up man, but
proved this spring that he wants

no part of that. Bunce was named
"Outstanding Offensive Player" in
the final Red-White scrimmage
last Saturday completing 12 of 24
passes for 208 yards and two
touchdowns, and ran one for
himself.
Plunkett was no slouch either,
as he guided his White squad to a
25-21 win with 14 completions in
26 attempts for 215 yards. Both
quarterbacks were down
considerably from their first
practice totals two weeks ago. At
that time, both offensive teams
went absolutely berserk with
Plunkett's group again winning,
48-47.
Ends Split
The unbelievable scoring
displays during the spring were
especially amazing because of the
lack of receivers present. Starting
split end Jack Lasater is overseas
as is tight end Ron Kadziel. Bob
Moore and Craig Luisiani were
both busy with baseball while
speedy flanker Rick Tipton is still
jumping hurdles with the track
team.
Jim Cross has been a top target
for both Stanford guns this spring.
The 1967 starter was red-shirted
last year. Also showing well have
been Demea Washington and JC
transfer Randy Vataha.
Although the passing game has
been excellent, the Tribe's
running performances cannot be
overlooked. Howie Williams has
shifted from halfback this spring
to take over the fullback chores to
be left vacant by the graduation
of Greg Broughton. Howie
finished out the '68 season in fine
form and should be able to fill the

gap. Bubba Brown is slated to run
from the halfback slot next iall,
but has gotten quite a challenge
for his job from freshman running
back Jackie Brown. Bunce himself
is a fine runner, and pre-season
All-America Plunkett is totally
unpredictable with the ball,
mixing up his passing and running
plays. The effectiveness of the
ground game may well determine
the overall strength of the offense.
Question Mark
Stanford's offensive line will
suffer little from graduation. This
unit is, along with the running
backs and defensive line, the most
important key to a successful
season. If they are able to provide
adequate protection for the Card
passers and open the holes for
Williams and the Browns, the
scoring machine will roll in high
gear.
All-America center John Sande
anchors the group, with veterans
Bob Reinhard and Dan Lightfoot
at the guards. Pete Seymour
returns at one tackle, with the
other outside spot open for the
time being.
Best Or Worst?
During the recent workouts, it
was obvious tha the offense was
clicking, but the defense was a
different story. After the 95
points and 1,000 yards gained in
the first scrimmage. Coach
Ralston remarked that he didn't
know whether he had the greatest
offense or worst defense in the
world. But during the final week
of practice, some of the problems
were solved, and the defense
seemed to jell. Ralston feels his
linebackers are the best in the

league, starting with All-America
Don Parish. Parish was everywhere
during the spring, and showed
why he was the team's leading
tackier last year. Other backers
are Pat Preston (number two
tackier in '68) and probably Dick
Oliver, a deep back last season.
Mainstays of the secondary,
Jim Kauffman and Rich Keller
were both absent from spring ball,
but the Tribe coaches anticipate
no troubles here. The worst time
they will have all year will be in
practice against Plunkett and
Bunce.
The defensive line may cause
headaches for the Indians. The
reason is inexperience. Freshman
Pete Lazetich has been the top
man in this depleted department
this spring. Last year's starters will
be gone.
Individual Stressed
"Spring practice is really trying
to put the square pegs in the
square holes," said Coach Ralston.
"It is a time to inspect our
material and plan for the fall."
Ralston stressed the
importance of spring practice to
the coaches saying that it is a
period when each player is judged
by himself, "In the fall, the
emphasis is on team play," he
continued. "But in the spring we
try to upgrade the individual."
This particular spring ranks
favorably when compared with
others the Tribe has had in the
Ralston-era. "More players have
been missing than ever before,
because of other sports, or the
overseas campuses," he remarked,
"but overall we have made very
good progress with very few
injuries. I am extremely pleased."
Tough Year
The season shcedule shapes up
as a rugged one for the Tribe.
After opening on September 20
hosting San Jose State, Pac-8 play
begins. The very next weekend

the Oregon Ducks come to the
Farm.
"San Jose will not be a
pushover," said Ralston. "They
have a new coach and an entirely
new program down there. The
Oregon contest is one of the most
important of the year," he added.
"Oregon will be the most
improved team in the league, and
has a good shot at knocking off
anybody."
The next Saturday, October 4,
the Indians go on a two week road
trip against the two biggest,
Purdue and USC. After these
back-to-back away games,
Stanford returns home to meet
Washington State and UCLA on
successive weekends before
leaving again for Corvallis and
Seattle to face OSU and
Washington.
The final two encounters are at
home. November 15, the Air
Force comes to town with the
best team they have had in eleven
years. November 22 ends the
regular season with, of course,
California.
Again The Trojans
In the Pac-8, USC again looks
like the team to beat. Their
defense is still the best around,
and John McKay is currently
training two replacements for
running back. The tradition of
Mike Garrett and O.J. is sure to be
upheld.
The conference as a whole will
be more balanced. UCLA, if they
can solve their quarterbacking
problems, will return to
prominence, and Washington will
lose only 13 seniors this spring.
Cal may still be inconsistent, but
they have the talent to take it all.
August 27, the varsity football
squad will return for fall practice,
and the cloudy issues will be
clarified. But, for the time being,
Stanford looks like a team to
reckon with. Amazing, but true.

Cal may still be inconsistent, but
they have the talent to take it all.
August 27, the varsity football
squad will return for fall practice,
and the cloudy issues will be
clarified. But, for the time being,
Stanford looks like a team to
reckon with. Amazing, but true.


THE MAI) SCRAMBLE IS ON AGAIN
Last season was a big one for
the Stanford varsity football
program. They went to the pass
and came up with a potent
offense capable of scoring from
everywhere on the field. Next
year may prove to be even bigger,
and, filled with more passes. Let
all opponents be warned—the
Indians will be a definite threat
for the Rose Bowl.
Gene Washington will be gone.
Malcolm Snider and Greg Buehler
will also be gone. But so will O.J.
Simpson, Bill Enyart, Ed White,
and Steve Sogge. The Pacific-8
race for the roses will be decided
by what is remaining, and here is
where Stanford hold the upper
hand.
Coach John Ralston may get
his first free trip to Pasadena
literally "by air." The best
quarterback on the coast has
proven that his sophomore year
was no fluke. Jim Plunkett
uncorked the ball like a pro in the
three weeks of spring practice just
completed, and although
Washington won't be around to
haul them in, seven other prime
receivers will be.
Bunce Shines
It is always conforting for a
coach to be able to rely on more
than one man to carry his offense.
Ralston may be so comforted
next season he won't know what
to do. Not only is the varsity
knee-deep in fine pass catchers,
but they also own more than one
outstanding pass thrower.
Sophomore Don Bunce spent last
season as back-up man, but
proved this spring that he wants

no part of that. Bunce was named
"Outstanding Offensive Player" in
the final Red-White scrimmage
last Saturday completing 12 of 24
passes for 208 yards and two
touchdowns, and ran one for
himself.
Plunkett was no slouch either,
as he guided his White squad to a
25-21 win with 14 completions in
26 attempts for 215 yards. Both
quarterbacks were down
considerably from their first
practice totals two weeks ago. At
that time, both offensive teams
went absolutely berserk with
Plunkett's group again winning,
48-47.
Ends Split
The unbelievable scoring
displays during the spring were
especially amazing because of the
lack of receivers present. Starting
split end Jack Lasater is overseas
as is tight end Ron Kadziel. Bob
Moore and Craig Luisiani were
both busy with baseball while
speedy flanker Rick Tipton is still
jumping hurdles with the track
team.
Jim Cross has been a top target
for both Stanford guns this spring.
The 1967 starter was red-shirted
last year. Also showing well have
been Demea Washington and JC
transfer Randy Vataha.
Although the passing game has
been excellent, the Tribe's
running performances cannot be
overlooked. Howie Williams has
shifted from halfback this spring
to take over the fullback chores to
be left vacant by the graduation
of Greg Broughton. Howie
finished out the '68 season in fine
form and should be able to fill the

gap. Bubba Brown is slated to run
from the halfback slot next iall,
but has gotten quite a challenge
for his job from freshman running
back Jackie Brown. Bunce himself
is a fine runner, and pre-season
All-America Plunkett is totally
unpredictable with the ball,
mixing up his passing and running
plays. The effectiveness of the
ground game may well determine
the overall strength of the offense.
Question Mark
Stanford's offensive line will
suffer little from graduation. This
unit is, along with the running
backs and defensive line, the most
important key to a successful
season. If they are able to provide
adequate protection for the Card
passers and open the holes for
Williams and the Browns, the
scoring machine will roll in high
gear.
All-America center John Sande
anchors the group, with veterans
Bob Reinhard and Dan Lightfoot
at the guards. Pete Seymour
returns at one tackle, with the
other outside spot open for the
time being.
Best Or Worst?
During the recent workouts, it
was obvious tha the offense was
clicking, but the defense was a
different story. After the 95
points and 1,000 yards gained in
the first scrimmage. Coach
Ralston remarked that he didn't
know whether he had the greatest
offense or worst defense in the
world. But during the final week
of practice, some of the problems
were solved, and the defense
seemed to jell. Ralston feels his
linebackers are the best in the

league, starting with All-America
Don Parish. Parish was everywhere
during the spring, and showed
why he was the team's leading
tackier last year. Other backers
are Pat Preston (number two
tackier in '68) and probably Dick
Oliver, a deep back last season.
Mainstays of the secondary,
Jim Kauffman and Rich Keller
were both absent from spring ball,
but the Tribe coaches anticipate
no troubles here. The worst time
they will have all year will be in
practice against Plunkett and
Bunce.
The defensive line may cause
headaches for the Indians. The
reason is inexperience. Freshman
Pete Lazetich has been the top
man in this depleted department
this spring. Last year's starters will
be gone.
Individual Stressed
"Spring practice is really trying
to put the square pegs in the
square holes," said Coach Ralston.
"It is a time to inspect our
material and plan for the fall."
Ralston stressed the
importance of spring practice to
the coaches saying that it is a
period when each player is judged
by himself, "In the fall, the
emphasis is on team play," he
continued. "But in the spring we
try to upgrade the individual."
This particular spring ranks
favorably when compared with
others the Tribe has had in the
Ralston-era. "More players have
been missing than ever before,
because of other sports, or the
overseas campuses," he remarked,
"but overall we have made very
good progress with very few
injuries. I am extremely pleased."
Tough Year
The season shcedule shapes up
as a rugged one for the Tribe.
After opening on September 20
hosting San Jose State, Pac-8 play
begins. The very next weekend

the Oregon Ducks come to the
Farm.
"San Jose will not be a
pushover," said Ralston. "They
have a new coach and an entirely
new program down there. The
Oregon contest is one of the most
important of the year," he added.
"Oregon will be the most
improved team in the league, and
has a good shot at knocking off
anybody."
The next Saturday, October 4,
the Indians go on a two week road
trip against the two biggest,
Purdue and USC. After these
back-to-back away games,
Stanford returns home to meet
Washington State and UCLA on
successive weekends before
leaving again for Corvallis and
Seattle to face OSU and
Washington.
The final two encounters are at
home. November 15, the Air
Force comes to town with the
best team they have had in eleven
years. November 22 ends the
regular season with, of course,
California.
Again The Trojans
In the Pac-8, USC again looks
like the team to beat. Their
defense is still the best around,
and John McKay is currently
training two replacements for
running back. The tradition of
Mike Garrett and O.J. is sure to be
upheld.
The conference as a whole will
be more balanced. UCLA, if they
can solve their quarterbacking
problems, will return to
prominence, and Washington will
lose only 13 seniors this spring.
Cal may still be inconsistent, but
they have the talent to take it all.

running back. The tradition of
Mike Garrett and O.J. is sure to be

The conference as a whole will
be more balanced. UCLA, if they
can solve their quarterbacking
problems, will return to
prominence, and Washington will
lose only 13 seniors this spring.
Cal may still be inconsistent, but
they have the talent to take it all.
August 27, the varsity football
squad will return for fall practice,
and the cloudy issues will be
clarified. But, for the time being,
Stanford looks like a team to
reckon with. Amazing, but true.


THE MAI) SCRAMBLE IS ON AGAIN
Last season was a big one for
the Stanford varsity football
program. They went to the pass
and came up with a potent
offense capable of scoring from
everywhere on the field. Next
year may prove to be even bigger,
and, filled with more passes. Let
all opponents be warned—the
Indians will be a definite threat
for the Rose Bowl.
Gene Washington will be gone.
Malcolm Snider and Greg Buehler
will also be gone. But so will O.J.
Simpson, Bill Enyart, Ed White,
and Steve Sogge. The Pacific-8
race for the roses will be decided
by what is remaining, and here is
where Stanford hold the upper
hand.
Coach John Ralston may get
his first free trip to Pasadena
literally "by air." The best
quarterback on the coast has
proven that his sophomore year
was no fluke. Jim Plunkett
uncorked the ball like a pro in the
three weeks of spring practice just
completed, and although
Washington won't be around to
haul them in, seven other prime
receivers will be.
Bunce Shines
It is always conforting for a
coach to be able to rely on more
than one man to carry his offense.
Ralston may be so comforted
next season he won't know what
to do. Not only is the varsity
knee-deep in fine pass catchers,
but they also own more than one
outstanding pass thrower.
Sophomore Don Bunce spent last
season as back-up man, but
proved this spring that he wants

no part of that. Bunce was named
"Outstanding Offensive Player" in
the final Red-White scrimmage
last Saturday completing 12 of 24
passes for 208 yards and two
touchdowns, and ran one for
himself.
Plunkett was no slouch either,
as he guided his White squad to a
25-21 win with 14 completions in
26 attempts for 215 yards. Both
quarterbacks were down
considerably from their first
practice totals two weeks ago. At
that time, both offensive teams
went absolutely berserk with
Plunkett's group again winning,
48-47.
Ends Split
The unbelievable scoring
displays during the spring were
especially amazing because of the
lack of receivers present. Starting
split end Jack Lasater is overseas
as is tight end Ron Kadziel. Bob
Moore and Craig Luisiani were
both busy with baseball while
speedy flanker Rick Tipton is still
jumping hurdles with the track
team.
Jim Cross has been a top target
for both Stanford guns this spring.
The 1967 starter was red-shirted
last year. Also showing well have
been Demea Washington and JC
transfer Randy Vataha.
Although the passing game has
been excellent, the Tribe's
running performances cannot be
overlooked. Howie Williams has
shifted from halfback this spring
to take over the fullback chores to
be left vacant by the graduation
of Greg Broughton. Howie
finished out the '68 season in fine
form and should be able to fill the

gap. Bubba Brown is slated to run
from the halfback slot next iall,
but has gotten quite a challenge
for his job from freshman running
back Jackie Brown. Bunce himself
is a fine runner, and pre-season
All-America Plunkett is totally
unpredictable with the ball,
mixing up his passing and running
plays. The effectiveness of the
ground game may well determine
the overall strength of the offense.
Question Mark
Stanford's offensive line will
suffer little from graduation. This
unit is, along with the running
backs and defensive line, the most
important key to a successful
season. If they are able to provide
adequate protection for the Card
passers and open the holes for
Williams and the Browns, the
scoring machine will roll in high
gear.
All-America center John Sande
anchors the group, with veterans
Bob Reinhard and Dan Lightfoot
at the guards. Pete Seymour
returns at one tackle, with the
other outside spot open for the
time being.
Best Or Worst?
During the recent workouts, it
was obvious tha the offense was
clicking, but the defense was a
different story. After the 95
points and 1,000 yards gained in
the first scrimmage. Coach
Ralston remarked that he didn't
know whether he had the greatest
offense or worst defense in the
world. But during the final week
of practice, some of the problems
were solved, and the defense
seemed to jell. Ralston feels his
linebackers are the best in the

league, starting with All-America
Don Parish. Parish was everywhere
during the spring, and showed
why he was the team's leading
tackier last year. Other backers
are Pat Preston (number two
tackier in '68) and probably Dick
Oliver, a deep back last season.
Mainstays of the secondary,
Jim Kauffman and Rich Keller
were both absent from spring ball,
but the Tribe coaches anticipate
no troubles here. The worst time
they will have all year will be in
practice against Plunkett and
Bunce.
The defensive line may cause
headaches for the Indians. The
reason is inexperience. Freshman
Pete Lazetich has been the top
man in this depleted department
this spring. Last year's starters will
be gone.
Individual Stressed
"Spring practice is really trying
to put the square pegs in the
square holes," said Coach Ralston.
"It is a time to inspect our
material and plan for the fall."
Ralston stressed the
importance of spring practice to
the coaches saying that it is a
period when each player is judged
by himself, "In the fall, the
emphasis is on team play," he
continued. "But in the spring we
try to upgrade the individual."
This particular spring ranks
favorably when compared with
others the Tribe has had in the
Ralston-era. "More players have
been missing than ever before,
because of other sports, or the
overseas campuses," he remarked,
"but overall we have made very
good progress with very few
injuries. I am extremely pleased."
Tough Year
The season shcedule shapes up
as a rugged one for the Tribe.
After opening on September 20
hosting San Jose State, Pac-8 play
begins. The very next weekend

the Oregon Ducks come to the
Farm.
"San Jose will not be a
pushover," said Ralston. "They
have a new coach and an entirely
new program down there. The
Oregon contest is one of the most
important of the year," he added.
"Oregon will be the most
improved team in the league, and
has a good shot at knocking off
anybody."
The next Saturday, October 4,
the Indians go on a two week road
trip against the two biggest,
Purdue and USC. After these
back-to-back away games,
Stanford returns home to meet
Washington State and UCLA on
successive weekends before
leaving again for Corvallis and
Seattle to face OSU and
Washington.
The final two encounters are at
home. November 15, the Air
Force comes to town with the
best team they have had in eleven
years. November 22 ends the
regular season with, of course,
California.
Again The Trojans
In the Pac-8, USC again looks
like the team to beat. Their
defense is still the best around,
and John McKay is currently
training two replacements for
running back. The tradition of
Mike Garrett and O.J. is sure to be
upheld.

Force comes to town with the
best team they have had in eleven
years. November 22 ends the
regular season with, of course,
California.
Again The Trojans
In the Pac-8, USC again looks
like the team to beat. Their
defense is still the best around,
and John McKay is currently
training two replacements for
running back. The tradition of
Mike Garrett and O.J. is sure to be
upheld.
The conference as a whole will
be more balanced. UCLA, if they
can solve their quarterbacking
problems, will return to
prominence, and Washington will
lose only 13 seniors this spring.
Cal may still be inconsistent, but
they have the talent to take it all.
August 27, the varsity football
squad will return for fall practice,
and the cloudy issues will be
clarified. But, for the time being,
Stanford looks like a team to
reckon with. Amazing, but true.


THE MAI) SCRAMBLE IS ON AGAIN
Last season was a big one for
the Stanford varsity football
program. They went to the pass
and came up with a potent
offense capable of scoring from
everywhere on the field. Next
year may prove to be even bigger,
and, filled with more passes. Let
all opponents be warned—the
Indians will be a definite threat
for the Rose Bowl.
Gene Washington will be gone.
Malcolm Snider and Greg Buehler
will also be gone. But so will O.J.
Simpson, Bill Enyart, Ed White,
and Steve Sogge. The Pacific-8
race for the roses will be decided
by what is remaining, and here is
where Stanford hold the upper
hand.
Coach John Ralston may get
his first free trip to Pasadena
literally "by air." The best
quarterback on the coast has
proven that his sophomore year
was no fluke. Jim Plunkett
uncorked the ball like a pro in the
three weeks of spring practice just
completed, and although
Washington won't be around to
haul them in, seven other prime
receivers will be.
Bunce Shines
It is always conforting for a
coach to be able to rely on more
than one man to carry his offense.
Ralston may be so comforted
next season he won't know what
to do. Not only is the varsity
knee-deep in fine pass catchers,
but they also own more than one
outstanding pass thrower.
Sophomore Don Bunce spent last
season as back-up man, but
proved this spring that he wants

no part of that. Bunce was named
"Outstanding Offensive Player" in
the final Red-White scrimmage
last Saturday completing 12 of 24
passes for 208 yards and two
touchdowns, and ran one for
himself.
Plunkett was no slouch either,
as he guided his White squad to a
25-21 win with 14 completions in
26 attempts for 215 yards. Both
quarterbacks were down
considerably from their first
practice totals two weeks ago. At
that time, both offensive teams
went absolutely berserk with
Plunkett's group again winning,
48-47.
Ends Split
The unbelievable scoring
displays during the spring were
especially amazing because of the
lack of receivers present. Starting
split end Jack Lasater is overseas
as is tight end Ron Kadziel. Bob
Moore and Craig Luisiani were
both busy with baseball while
speedy flanker Rick Tipton is still
jumping hurdles with the track
team.
Jim Cross has been a top target
for both Stanford guns this spring.
The 1967 starter was red-shirted
last year. Also showing well have
been Demea Washington and JC
transfer Randy Vataha.
Although the passing game has
been excellent, the Tribe's
running performances cannot be
overlooked. Howie Williams has
shifted from halfback this spring
to take over the fullback chores to
be left vacant by the graduation
of Greg Broughton. Howie
finished out the '68 season in fine
form and should be able to fill the

gap. Bubba Brown is slated to run
from the halfback slot next iall,
but has gotten quite a challenge
for his job from freshman running
back Jackie Brown. Bunce himself
is a fine runner, and pre-season
All-America Plunkett is totally
unpredictable with the ball,
mixing up his passing and running
plays. The effectiveness of the
ground game may well determine
the overall strength of the offense.
Question Mark
Stanford's offensive line will
suffer little from graduation. This
unit is, along with the running
backs and defensive line, the most
important key to a successful
season. If they are able to provide
adequate protection for the Card
passers and open the holes for
Williams and the Browns, the
scoring machine will roll in high
gear.
All-America center John Sande
anchors the group, with veterans
Bob Reinhard and Dan Lightfoot
at the guards. Pete Seymour
returns at one tackle, with the
other outside spot open for the
time being.
Best Or Worst?
During the recent workouts, it
was obvious tha the offense was
clicking, but the defense was a
different story. After the 95
points and 1,000 yards gained in
the first scrimmage. Coach
Ralston remarked that he didn't
know whether he had the greatest
offense or worst defense in the
world. But during the final week
of practice, some of the problems
were solved, and the defense
seemed to jell. Ralston feels his
linebackers are the best in the

league, starting with All-America
Don Parish. Parish was everywhere
during the spring, and showed
why he was the team's leading
tackier last year. Other backers
are Pat Preston (number two
tackier in '68) and probably Dick
Oliver, a deep back last season.
Mainstays of the secondary,
Jim Kauffman and Rich Keller
were both absent from spring ball,
but the Tribe coaches anticipate
no troubles here. The worst time
they will have all year will be in
practice against Plunkett and
Bunce.
The defensive line may cause
headaches for the Indians. The
reason is inexperience. Freshman
Pete Lazetich has been the top
man in this depleted department
this spring. Last year's starters will
be gone.
Individual Stressed
"Spring practice is really trying
to put the square pegs in the
square holes," said Coach Ralston.
"It is a time to inspect our
material and plan for the fall."
Ralston stressed the
importance of spring practice to
the coaches saying that it is a
period when each player is judged
by himself, "In the fall, the
emphasis is on team play," he
continued. "But in the spring we
try to upgrade the individual."
This particular spring ranks
favorably when compared with
others the Tribe has had in the
Ralston-era. "More players have
been missing than ever before,
because of other sports, or the
overseas campuses," he remarked,
"but overall we have made very
good progress with very few
injuries. I am extremely pleased."
Tough Year
The season shcedule shapes up
as a rugged one for the Tribe.
After opening on September 20
hosting San Jose State, Pac-8 play
begins. The very next weekend

the Oregon Ducks come to the
Farm.
"San Jose will not be a
pushover," said Ralston. "They
have a new coach and an entirely
new program down there. The
Oregon contest is one of the most
important of the year," he added.
"Oregon will be the most
improved team in the league, and
has a good shot at knocking off
anybody."
The next Saturday, October 4,
the Indians go on a two week road
trip against the two biggest,
Purdue and USC. After these
back-to-back away games,
Stanford returns home to meet
Washington State and UCLA on
successive weekends before
leaving again for Corvallis and
Seattle to face OSU and
Washington.
The final two encounters are at
home. November 15, the Air
Force comes to town with the
best team they have had in eleven
years. November 22 ends the
regular season with, of course,
California.
