# Pitzer: More Charges On Individuals
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER EILEEN HALEY 
During a question-and-answer period
which followed iiis address to the
Stanford Mother's Club, Stanford
University President Kenneth Pitzer
stated yesterday "1 would be glad to see
police and other civil officials bring
charges against more individuals than
have actually been arrested."
"Further steps in this direction can
be taken by civil officials. Most of the
key people are under suspension
already."
The statement was made in response
to a question of punishment for
students involved in off-campus
disruption.
Pitzer also reiterated his
apprehensions about the country's
national priorities. He termed these
"seriously misguided."
He added that he hoped "national
pressures on students will be
terminated, especially through the
phasing out of the Vietnam War, and
making the draft more rational, if it has
to be kept at all."
Doing Its job
Yesterday's speech to the Club
followed closely along the lines of his
address to the alumni Saturday. While
avoiding controversial topics throughout
the prepared remarks, he reassured the
mothers that "Stanford is proceeding to
do its basic job in spite of distractions."
Many questions on campus
disruptions and the issues behind these,
were fielded by Pitzer after his remarks.
In response to a question on the
number of students who were "leaning
to the right," Pitzer stated that the
Young Americans for Freedom (YAF)
and the Young Republicans have a
"limited following" on campus.
Praise For CAC
Pitzer added that the newly-formed
Coalition for an Academic Community
(CAC) "with its emphasis on procedure,
has been effective in countering
propaganda attempting to legalize
disruption.
"Our greatest hope is with a group
like the CAC . . .which will focus on the
legitimate ways of expressing opinion."
A member of the audience asked
about the case of instructors who "fail
to comply with University regulations
and let suspended students attend
classes."
"The question of barring suspended
students from class is hazy," Pitzer
answered.
He labeled "outrageous" the action
of a group of Western Civ instructors,
who have threatened to withhold their
grade sheets if a student is found in
contempt of ccourt on the basis of his
presence in a Western Civ class.
"That was a relatively junior group
of faculty," Pitzer told his audience.
Quit A3IM
In another impromptu remark, Pitzer
said that "Many faculty are facing the

question of whether moderate students
should be encouraged to stay with the
April Third Movement as its tactics
escalate.
"I would encourage moderate
students to drop out."
One questioner expressed grave
concern about the use of the Stanford
Chapel by various groups. "Those who
have been in close contact with
Stanford University for a long time were
stunned at the happenings in the Chapel
recently . . .Thee were reports of
smoking, beer cans left around,
obscentities used . . ."
"Exaggerated stories do get out,"
Pitzer answered. "Dean of the Chapel
has heard many similar expressions of
concern."
Trustees "Flexible"
Referring to the Board of Trustees,
as he did in his weekend remarks to the
alumni, Pitzer described the "flexibility
they have shown in the face of changing
times."
He went into some detail on the
Trustees' efforts to adjust to the
temperament on and off campus.
''They're meeting more on
campus . . .they have joined student
groups, they are part of the University
Advisory Committee which has achieved
much hman understanding."
He admitted, however, that these
facts don't convince students "that the
Trustees are listening to their
viewpoint."
The subject ol national priorities was
touched on by a member of the
audience who affirmed support for
students "who have raised this question
with such insistence." Pitzer, in
reference to this, expressed a limited
degree of optimism.
He stated that this optimism was due
to "the great interest students are taking
in national and international problems,
and their willingness to devote energy to
solving them."
