# 'Senseless' Assault
## Kennedy Hits War Tactics 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP )-P resident
Nixon's announcement h_ will meet
with South Vietnam's president June 8
coincided Tuesday with a bristling
Senate debate over the scale of U.S.
military activity in that country.
Breaking silence, Sen. Edward M.
Kennedy, D-Mass., condemned what he
called the "senseless and irresponsible"
assault in which U.S. and South
Vietnamese forces recaptured
Hamburger Hill, a North Vietnamese
mountain top fortress.
Kennedy, often pictured as Nixon's
likely opponent in 1972, said there
could be no justification for sending
American fighting men to capture
ground that has no meaning as far as
peace negotiations are concerned.
"I am compelled to speak on this
question today for I believe the level of
our military activity in Vietnam runs
opposite to our stated intentions and
goals in Paris," Kennedy said.
"But more importantly, I feel it is
both senseless and irresponsible to
continue to send our young men to
their deaths to capture hills and
positions that have no relation to ending
this conflict . . .
"The assault on Hamburger Hill is
only symptomatic of a mentality and a
policy that requires immediate
attention. American boys are too
valuable to be sacrificed for a false sense
of military pride."
Sen. Hugh Scott of Pennsylvania, the
assistant Senate Republican leader,

replied with the tart suggestion that
Kennedy was trying to second guess the
commander in chief.
"I am not going to second guess the
President on the conduct of the war,"
Scott said. He added that unless support
is given to such military decisions "we
are not serving the cause of peace."
• 4 Outside Sources'
WASHINGTON (AP)-Atty. Gen.
John N. Mitchell said Tuesday the
government has evidence indicating that
revolutionary student groups financed
by outside sources are causing much of
the current campus disorder.
Mitchell told a House education
subcommittee his investigators have also
learned that high schools, labor unions,
churches and other institutions are on
the target list of the student groups.
He said on the basis of the Justice
Department investigation so far he
expected some of the student leaders
will be prosecuted on federal charges.
The attorney general said Students For
a Democratic Society is the most
prominent of the militant groups
involved on the campuses but he did not
link it directly to the investigation or
possible prosecutions.
Despite his warning that the militant
student movement constitutes a serious
national problem, Mitchell urged
Congress not to pass any more laws
trying to solve it.
He said college authorities, working
with state and local police, have primary'
responsibility for keeping order on the
campus.
The attorney general said the
principal role of the federal government
in dealing with campus disorders is to
investigate them, pass along to local
authorities any information turned up
and prosecute any violation of federal
law.
• Labor With SDS?
WASHINGTON (AP)-AFL-CIO
President George Meany warned
Tuesday that plans of radical student
leaders to shift antiwar activities from
campus to factory could cause conflicts
this summer.
Commenting on" a hitherto secret
instruction sheet issued by the Students
for a Democratic Society, Meany said,
"If they try to interfere with the
livelihood of workers in the plant,
something is likely to happen."

The instruction, a copy of which was
obtained by The Associated Press, says,
"Closing down our schools is not
enough. Workers produce and move the
goods that are used in the war and it is
they who are primarily forced to fight
the war. They can stop it."
A Meany aide said, "The workers
aren't going to be pushed around like
those SDS leaders push around the
majority of other college students, and I
expect employers won't be as chicken as
some college presidents."
The instructions advise SDS
followers to "bring to workers the idea
that the only just demand for peace is
the immediate withdrawal of the U.S.
from Vietnam.
•Whitehorn Guilty
SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Robert
Whitehorn, 22, of Palo Alto was found
guilty Tuesday of failing to register for
the draft after stating, like his younger
brother before him, that military service
"violated my conscience."
U.S. District Judge Alfonso Zirpoli
set June 13 for a probation report and
said to the jury:
"It is a particularly difficult case
because the defendant followed what he
thought was the dictate of his
conscience."
Robert's 18-year-old brother, Drik,
was found guilty of the same charge last
month. He is scheduled to be sentenced
May 28.
