# SJC Decides
## Was Encina Sit-in A 'Disruption?' 
### MICH AIL SWEENEY 
Alter two long days of deliberations,
the Stanford Judicial Council has
reportedly decided that the Encina Hall
sit-in May 1 was indeed a disruption
under the terms of the campus judicial
policy.
A well-informed source predicted
that the SJC will announce today that it
has asked President Pitzer to continue
the temporary suspensions of more than
70 students until they seek hearings.
Counsel for the April 3rd Movement
defendants contended in proceedings
Monday that the Encina sit-in was not a
disruption because no work activities in
Encina were planned for 1 a.m. to 7
a.m., the duration of the sit-in. The
campus demonstrations policy defines a
disruption as action which interferes
with regular university activities or the
free movement of people on legitimate
business.
If the SJC had agreed that the sit-in
did not qualify as a disruption, all the
temporary suspensions would have been
revoked, according to SJC chairman
Jack Friedenthal, professor of law. The
suspensions were imposed without prior
hearing under emergency powers
assumed by Pitzer after the AEL sit-in.
On Monday, four employees of the
News & Publications office, located in
Encina, testified along with a faculty
member and a member of the dean of
students staff. These witnesses described
three incidents that were suggested as
disruptions of normal activities.
First, several employees of the News
service were listening to KZSU radio
when the vote was taken at the April
3rd Movement meeting to sit-in at
Encina. Anticipating the seizure, News
director Bob Beyers decided they
should leave their offices.
Second, Harry Press of the News
Service testified that he returned to his
office during the sit-in but left when he
saw several demonstrators occupying it.
Under further questionning, Press said
he had not attempted to work there nor

had he asked the demonstrators to
leave.
Third, a News Service photographer
was said to have been warned not to
take photographs inside Encina.
The SJC was also considering
whether searching files or breaking
windows contributed to the disruption
of normal activities.
Defense counsel Doron Weinberg,
Alan Rader and Sandy Miller argued
that none of the testimony showed that

a disruption had occurred under the
demonstrations policy. If acts such as
threatening a photographer or breaking
windows did happen, the defense
argued, then the individual students
who did those things should be
prosecuted. But no other persons should
be assumed to be guilty and suspended,
the defense claimed. The defense asked
that the blanket suspensions be revoked.
The defense called four witnesses at
the hearing. One of them, Paul

Bernstein, testified that he offered to
help Harry Press gain access to materials
in his office.
The SJC met for six hours Tuesday
in closed sessions to reach a decision.
An informed source said that the
Council was in agreement that
disruptive acts occurred, but was
divided over whether the automatic,
temporary suspensions should continue
or whether only those students involved
in the specific disruptive acts should be
prosecuted. A majority will recommend
to Pitzer that the suspensions remain in
effect.
The SJC was forced to formally
decide whether Encina was a disruption
because six suspended students asked
for a hearing but would not admit guilt.
Last week, four other suspended
students had pleaded guilty and received
fines and probation.
Friedenthal says that about 15 of the
75 suspended students have requested
hearings. Suspensions remain in effect
until a student requests such a hearing.
A group of the defendants have
pressed the SJC to agree to a joint
hearing, instead of individual hearings.
The SJC was reported to have decided
to allow a joint hearing if the
defendants admit in advance that they
willingly remained in Encina after the
warning to leave, and admit several
other points.
The SJC has also been discussing its
own organization. As presently
constituted, the eight-member council
both calls witnesses, solicits evidence,
and passes sentence. Steve Heiser, a
Movement defense counsel, had
condemned this structure as
"inquisitorial." Some mebers of the SJC
are reportedly in agreement that the
SJC needs a separate prosecutor.
The SJC includes Friedenthal as
chairman who votes only in case of tie,
Professor Herbert Lederman, Eugene
Franklin, James Rosse, and Robert
Sprouse, and students Dick Lee, Mike
Russel and Paul Holdorf.

office during the sit-in but left when he
saw several demonstrators occupying it.
Under further questionning, Press said
he had not attempted to work there nor

had he asked the demonstrators to
leave.
Third, a News Service photographer
was said to have been warned not to
take photographs inside Encina.
The SJC was also considering
whether searching files or breaking
windows contributed to the disruption
of normal activities.
Defense counsel Doron Weinberg,
Alan Rader and Sandy Miller argued
that none of the testimony showed that

a disruption had occurred under the
demonstrations policy. If acts such as
threatening a photographer or breaking
windows did happen, the defense
argued, then the individual students
who did those things should be
prosecuted. But no other persons should
be assumed to be guilty and suspended,
the defense claimed. The defense asked
that the blanket suspensions be revoked.
The defense called four witnesses at
the hearing. One of them, Paul

Bernstein, testified that he offered to
help Harry Press gain access to materials
in his office.
The SJC met for six hours Tuesday
in closed sessions to reach a decision.
An informed source said that the
Council was in agreement that
disruptive acts occurred, but was
divided over whether the automatic,
temporary suspensions should continue
or whether only those students involved
in the specific disruptive acts should be
prosecuted. A majority will recommend
to Pitzer that the suspensions remain in
effect.
The SJC was forced to formally
decide whether Encina was a disruption
because six suspended students asked
for a hearing but would not admit guilt.
Last week, four other suspended
students had pleaded guilty and received
fines and probation.
Friedenthal says that about 15 of the
75 suspended students have requested
hearings. Suspensions remain in effect
until a student requests such a hearing.
A group of the defendants have
pressed the SJC to agree to a joint
hearing, instead of individual hearings.
The SJC was reported to have decided
to allow a joint hearing if the
defendants admit in advance that they
willingly remained in Encina after the
warning to leave, and admit several
other points.
The SJC has also been discussing its
own organization. As presently
constituted, the eight-member council
both calls witnesses, solicits evidence,
and passes sentence. Steve Heiser, a
Movement defense counsel, had
condemned this structure as
"inquisitorial." Some mebers of the SJC
are reportedly in agreement that the
SJC needs a separate prosecutor.
The SJC includes Friedenthal as
chairman who votes only in case of tie,
Professor Herbert Lederman, Eugene
Franklin, James Rosse, and Robert
Sprouse, and students Dick Lee, Mike
Russel and Paul Holdorf.

Alter two long days of deliberations,
the Stanford Judicial Council has
reportedly decided that the Encina Hall
sit-in May 1 was indeed a disruption
under the terms of the campus judicial
policy.
A well-informed source predicted
that the SJC will announce today that it
has asked President Pitzer to continue
the temporary suspensions of more than
70 students until they seek hearings.
Counsel for the April 3rd Movement
defendants contended in proceedings
Monday that the Encina sit-in was not a
disruption because no work activities in
Encina were planned for 1 a.m. to 7
a.m., the duration of the sit-in. The
campus demonstrations policy defines a
disruption as action which interferes
with regular university activities or the
free movement of people on legitimate
business.
If the SJC had agreed that the sit-in
did not qualify as a disruption, all the
temporary suspensions would have been
revoked, according to SJC chairman
Jack Friedenthal, professor of law. The
suspensions were imposed without prior
hearing under emergency powers
assumed by Pitzer after the AEL sit-in.
On Monday, four employees of the
News & Publications office, located in
Encina, testified along with a faculty
member and a member of the dean of
students staff. These witnesses described
three incidents that were suggested as
disruptions of normal activities.
First, several employees of the News
service were listening to KZSU radio
when the vote was taken at the April
3rd Movement meeting to sit-in at
Encina. Anticipating the seizure, News
director Bob Beyers decided they
should leave their offices.
Second, Harry Press of the News
Service testified that he returned to his
office during the sit-in but left when he
saw several demonstrators occupying it.
