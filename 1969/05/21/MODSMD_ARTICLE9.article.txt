# New Students
## 
### 
This week, the members of the
Pre-Registration Commission are asking all
interested faculty and students to join with
them in giving next fall's new students a
challenging and provocative introduction to
Stanford. They are calling this introductory
program a "Colloquy."
Faculty members and staff have received
invitations to lead and host
dinner-discussions on Friday, September
26. If faculty support is gained, the
dinner-discussions will be the high point of
an all-day program of seminars designed to
engage the newly arrived student in active,
personal contact with the process of
education.
The members of the Pre-Reg
Commission have tried to focus the
day-long Colloquy on informal dinners to
facilitate* interpersonal exchange and to
provide a deinstitutionalized atmosphere.
Each Colloquy seminar will be composed
of small groups from the same residence or
fall-quarter classes. For example, it is
hoped that freshman seminar professors
will meet their seminar as a Colloquy
group. It is intended that the members of
each Colloquy seminar view the group as
continuing beyond Pre-Reg week.

Keynoting the Colloquy in the morning
will be Wolfgang Panofsky, director of
SLAC, and Philip Zimbardo, professor of
psychology. After their talks the freshmen
and transfers will divide into the Colloquy
seminars for student-led discussions.
The student-led seminars are crucial to
the overall goal of introducing new
students to personal education, since fellow
students, particularly older ones, are vital
to the learning process. Pre-Reg seeks to
bring together new and returning students
to begin the experience of learning at
Stanford as soon as possible.
Though distant across the summer
months and further blurred by the onrush
of spring crises, Pre-Reg week is growing in
the minds and eyes of a few persons
looking toward September and another
year. For a successful Pre-Reg week, the
minds of many more professors and
students must come to the same vision.
Students interested in leading a seminar
should contact Bob Thompson at 327-0740
ext. 301. The Pre-Reg Commission asks
that the individual student seminar leader
secure his own co-leader so that the two
will work well together.
