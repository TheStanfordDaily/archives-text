# Movement Plans Picketing At SRI
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ and,TOM ARIMA 
The April Third Movement decided
last night to continue peaceful protests
for the next few days, but the
possibility of militant action at any time
still remains.
In a three-hour meeting in Tresidder
large lounge, the group approved plans
for a rally in White Plaza at 11:45 a.m.
today, followed by a peaceful picket at
the Hanover facility of the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI), and a picket at
SRl's main offices in Menlo Park
tomorrow.
But numerous proposals for
immediate militant action—including
occupying Encina Hall and Hoover
Tower —were all passed by without any
such suggestion coming up for a vote.
A capacity crowd slowly dwindled as
it became apparent that no major action
would be approved because of a lack of
a consensus. Proposals were made and
debated—some receiving significant
support—but none were approved.
Previous Plan Reaffirmed
The previous plan, to move on SRI
Hanover when police are no longer there
in force and to inform Movement
members of the action through a phone
tree, was reaffirmed, however.
Also approved by the meeting was a
state and perhaps nationwide call for
two Days of Solidarity with the
students and street people at Berkeley.
This motion was also passed by the
members of the Stanford SDS chapter
at the meeting which voted separately
on the measure.
Monday and Tuesday had been
selected for the Days of Solidarity.
Speakers will go to other campuses to
explain the situation at Berkeley, and
discussions of problems at each
particular campus will also be held.
Lost in the shuffle of proposals for
militant action and the picketing at SRI

was a motion passed early in the
meeting. The proposal calls for a
phone-in to the University unless phone
service was restored to the Movement's
new headquarters in the Storke Student
Publications Building.
Use of Office Approved
The Movement's use of the
second-floor office for printing and
writing leaflets was approved Monday
by the Publications Board, which
controls the use of the Storke Building.
It also houses the Daily, the Quad,
Chaparral, and Sequoia.
At the same time, the Board voted to
reconnect the phone in the office the
A3M is using, after receiving assurance
from the Movement that they would
pay for use of the telephone.
It had been disconnected Saturday,
after being in partial service—outgoing
calls and calls from University
extensions went through, but calls to
the number from outside did not—for
some time.
When service had not been restored
by yesterday afternoon, Student
Financial Manager David Swift
contacted O.J. Killingsworth, in charge
of communications for the Physical
Plant.
Conflicting Reports
Killingsworth assured Swift that the
phone would be reconnected by this
morning, Movement members reported.
But when an A3M member contacted
Killingswo/th later yesterday, he was
told that service might not be restored
for as long as ten days.
If the service is not restored by noon,
a red flag will be raised on top of the
A3M Dome in White Plaza, signifying
that the phone-in is on.
It is not clear what the fate of the
phone-in will be, since the White Plaza
rally—for the same time—was approved
later in the meeting.
