## Join The Policeman Club 
### Louis Bogart 
I'm a policeman's club, and
let's leave Freud out of this.
Us clubs make close contact
with people, and we get to know
them pretty well. They're mostly
fairly decent Joes; not .as bad as
they're cracked up to be.
Like the cops who swing us,
for instance. They're not pigs. Oh
sure, you'll find some bad apples
in any barrel, but most cops aren't
bullies or sadists. They honestly
want to keep the world a decent
place to live in. 1 mean there are
such things as robbery, rape, and
murder, and if nobody did
anything about it you couldn't
have civilization, could you? I
mean you've got to have law and
order. And every once in a while,
a head gets cracked.
Funny thing about that; when
I split a skull it really splits for
me. I mean I get to know what

the guy inside it is really like, and
that's the guy who splits when I
hit him. I can see two of him. One
is the guy he's going to be, and
the other is the guy he would have
been if 1 hadn't hit him—if you
know what I mean.
Like Benny Moroney. Benny
wasn't much of a criminal, he had
his bad points, but he had is good
ones too. Like if you were poor
and came from a busted family,
and didn't have too much
education, there would be some
gaps in your character too.
Ambitious
Not that he actually went
hungry very often, but food isn't
everything. There were enough
kisses, bicycles, trips to the zoo,
clothes, picnics, cars, and girls
missing from his life, to keep him
from being altruistic. On the other
hand, he was no cheater. When he

worked, he worked hard; when he
fought, he fought hard; and he
stood by his friends. He was
ambitious, too, but hard work
didn't seem to swell his bank
account very fast, so he began to
bolster his income with a little hot
wiring on the side. That's when I
met him.
Now, you club that kind of a
man, and send him up for a
stretch, he turns bitter. It happens
every time. Benny figures he'd
been cheated by society, and he
was the sort of guy who can hold
a grudge. Fortunately for society,
the only men in the pen who
could tell him how to get his slice
of the pie were hardened
criminals. That kind of an enemy,
society can handle. I ought to
know.
But what about that other
Benny, who didn't get clobbered?
Well, he did all right. He made
enough money from his side line
to go into construction
contracting, and from then on he
had brains enough to stay legit.
He had brains enough to make a
success of his business, too. He
discovered that a little influence
at City Hall didn't hurt his
business a bit, and by the time he
had his second million, he had
enough influence to get himself
elected mayor.
Self-Made
He was no better or worse than
most mayors. Being a self-made
man, he had a decent respect for
free enterprise. He kept his police
department up to snuff, and
allowed no more truck with the
underworld than was absolutely
necessary to keep them informed.
Once, he was panned for turning
his cops loose on an anti-draft
demonstration, but he felt that
was a bum rap. Those college kids
had a hell of a lot more
advantages that he's ever had, and
if they still didn't hase more sense
in their heads than to defy law
and order like that, maybe it
ought to be knocked in with a
club.
A student's head splits just like
anyone elses.
Take Jim Matson, for instance.
Jim was a pleasant, outgoing type.
He was a sincere liberal, like you
find lots of in college, even in
business administration majors.
He really worried about poverty,
civil rights, and the military
industrial complex. He was a
bright boy, and could keep up a
four point average without

straining himself, so he had time
to look around. Naturally, he
looked around for a girl, and he
found one named Gloria, who was
thinking of joining the Peace
Corps. Jim and Gloria agreed
about lots of things, especially the
war in Vietnam. They even went
on a peace march once, but that
didn't turn out so good. Jim got
involved in an argument about a
marching permit, and that's when
I made his acquaintance.
Well, when a character like that
gets slugged and jugged, he sees
red. Jim decided society was in
worse shape than he'd realized. It
was too far gone for a patch-up
job; the whole thing would have
to be torn down and rebuilt. He
boned up on Marx, Lenin, and
Mao Tse Tung, and got himself set
to lead a revolutionary army, but
society lucked out on that one
too. There was no army for him
to lead. I mean the average Joe
may gripe a lot, but he's not going
to turn over the apple
Oh yes; the other Jim. Well, he
did about as you'd expect. He
graduated Magna cum Laud, or
Summa cum Laud, I forget which
is Laudest. He was snapped up by
a big electronics firm at twenty
thousand to start, and he and
Gloria got married. With his
ability, he went up fast and made
money fast, and after a while he
got bored with the whole thing.
He was still worried about civil
rights, poverty, and the military
industrial complex, so he decided
to go into politics to see if he
could do something about it. He
got a reputation as a fighting
liberal, and then he got to be
Governor of the State.
He actually made a start at
wiping out slums, and providing
better jobs, housing, and
education, but he couldn't go fast
enough. You know how people
are. Give them an inch, they want
the whole ball of string right now.
There were some big riots, and
some of the cities got scorched.
There was a lot of looting too,
and Jim had to call the National
Guard. The jails were so crammed,
they were talking of making
temporary camps to hold
theprisoners. You never saw so
many busted heads. Jim felt
pretty bad about it, but what
could he do? I mean you've got to
preserve law and order, don't
you?

to be torn down and rebuilt. He
boned up on Marx, Lenin, and
Mao Tse Tung, and got himself set
to lead a revolutionary army, but
society lucked out on that one
too. There was no army for him
to lead. I mean the average Joe
may gripe a lot, but he's not going
to turn over the apple
Oh yes; the other Jim. Well, he
did about as you'd expect. He
graduated Magna cum Laud, or
Summa cum Laud, I forget which
is Laudest. He was snapped up by
a big electronics firm at twenty
thousand to start, and he and
Gloria got married. With his
ability, he went up fast and made
money fast, and after a while he
got bored with the whole thing.
He was still worried about civil
rights, poverty, and the military
industrial complex, so he decided
to go into politics to see if he
could do something about it. He
got a reputation as a fighting
liberal, and then he got to be
Governor of the State.
He actually made a start at
wiping out slums, and providing
better jobs, housing, and
education, but he couldn't go fast
enough. You know how people
are. Give them an inch, they want
the whole ball of string right now.
There were some big riots, and
some of the cities got scorched.
There was a lot of looting too,
and Jim had to call the National
Guard. The jails were so crammed,
they were talking of making
temporary camps to hold
theprisoners. You never saw so
many busted heads. Jim felt
pretty bad about it, but what
could he do? I mean you've got to
preserve law and order, don't
you?

I'm a policeman's club, and
let's leave Freud out of this.
Us clubs make close contact
with people, and we get to know
them pretty well. They're mostly
fairly decent Joes; not .as bad as
they're cracked up to be.
Like the cops who swing us,
for instance. They're not pigs. Oh
sure, you'll find some bad apples
in any barrel, but most cops aren't
bullies or sadists. They honestly
want to keep the world a decent
place to live in. 1 mean there are
such things as robbery, rape, and
murder, and if nobody did
anything about it you couldn't
have civilization, could you? I
mean you've got to have law and
order. And every once in a while,
a head gets cracked.
Funny thing about that; when
I split a skull it really splits for
me. I mean I get to know what

the guy inside it is really like, and
that's the guy who splits when I
hit him. I can see two of him. One
is the guy he's going to be, and
the other is the guy he would have
been if 1 hadn't hit him—if you
know what I mean.
Like Benny Moroney. Benny
wasn't much of a criminal, he had
his bad points, but he had is good
ones too. Like if you were poor
and came from a busted family,
and didn't have too much
education, there would be some
gaps in your character too.
Ambitious
Not that he actually went
hungry very often, but food isn't
everything. There were enough
kisses, bicycles, trips to the zoo,
clothes, picnics, cars, and girls
missing from his life, to keep him
from being altruistic. On the other
hand, he was no cheater. When he

worked, he worked hard; when he
fought, he fought hard; and he
stood by his friends. He was
ambitious, too, but hard work
didn't seem to swell his bank
account very fast, so he began to
bolster his income with a little hot
wiring on the side. That's when I
met him.
Now, you club that kind of a
man, and send him up for a
stretch, he turns bitter. It happens
every time. Benny figures he'd
been cheated by society, and he
was the sort of guy who can hold
a grudge. Fortunately for society,
the only men in the pen who
could tell him how to get his slice
of the pie were hardened
criminals. That kind of an enemy,
society can handle. I ought to
know.
But what about that other
Benny, who didn't get clobbered?
Well, he did all right. He made
enough money from his side line
to go into construction
contracting, and from then on he
had brains enough to stay legit.
He had brains enough to make a
success of his business, too. He
discovered that a little influence
at City Hall didn't hurt his
business a bit, and by the time he
had his second million, he had
enough influence to get himself
elected mayor.
Self-Made
He was no better or worse than
most mayors. Being a self-made
man, he had a decent respect for
free enterprise. He kept his police
department up to snuff, and
allowed no more truck with the
underworld than was absolutely
necessary to keep them informed.
Once, he was panned for turning
his cops loose on an anti-draft
demonstration, but he felt that
was a bum rap. Those college kids
had a hell of a lot more
advantages that he's ever had, and
if they still didn't hase more sense
in their heads than to defy law
and order like that, maybe it
ought to be knocked in with a
club.
A student's head splits just like
anyone elses.
Take Jim Matson, for instance.
Jim was a pleasant, outgoing type.
He was a sincere liberal, like you
find lots of in college, even in
business administration majors.
He really worried about poverty,
civil rights, and the military
industrial complex. He was a
bright boy, and could keep up a
four point average without

straining himself, so he had time
to look around. Naturally, he
looked around for a girl, and he
found one named Gloria, who was
thinking of joining the Peace
Corps. Jim and Gloria agreed
about lots of things, especially the
war in Vietnam. They even went
on a peace march once, but that
didn't turn out so good. Jim got
involved in an argument about a
marching permit, and that's when
I made his acquaintance.
Well, when a character like that
gets slugged and jugged, he sees
red. Jim decided society was in
worse shape than he'd realized. It
was too far gone for a patch-up
job; the whole thing would have
to be torn down and rebuilt. He
boned up on Marx, Lenin, and
Mao Tse Tung, and got himself set
to lead a revolutionary army, but
society lucked out on that one
too. There was no army for him
to lead. I mean the average Joe

enough influence to get himself
elected mayor.
Self-Made
He was no better or worse than
most mayors. Being a self-made
man, he had a decent respect for
free enterprise. He kept his police
department up to snuff, and
allowed no more truck with the
underworld than was absolutely
necessary to keep them informed.
Once, he was panned for turning
his cops loose on an anti-draft
demonstration, but he felt that
was a bum rap. Those college kids
had a hell of a lot more
advantages that he's ever had, and
if they still didn't hase more sense
in their heads than to defy law
and order like that, maybe it
ought to be knocked in with a
club.
A student's head splits just like
anyone elses.
Take Jim Matson, for instance.
Jim was a pleasant, outgoing type.
He was a sincere liberal, like you
find lots of in college, even in
business administration majors.
He really worried about poverty,
civil rights, and the military
industrial complex. He was a
bright boy, and could keep up a
four point average without

straining himself, so he had time
to look around. Naturally, he
looked around for a girl, and he
found one named Gloria, who was
thinking of joining the Peace
Corps. Jim and Gloria agreed
about lots of things, especially the
war in Vietnam. They even went
on a peace march once, but that
didn't turn out so good. Jim got
involved in an argument about a
marching permit, and that's when
I made his acquaintance.
Well, when a character like that
gets slugged and jugged, he sees
red. Jim decided society was in
worse shape than he'd realized. It
was too far gone for a patch-up
job; the whole thing would have
to be torn down and rebuilt. He
boned up on Marx, Lenin, and
Mao Tse Tung, and got himself set
to lead a revolutionary army, but
society lucked out on that one
too. There was no army for him
to lead. I mean the average Joe
may gripe a lot, but he's not going
to turn over the apple
Oh yes; the other Jim. Well, he
did about as you'd expect. He
graduated Magna cum Laud, or
Summa cum Laud, I forget which
is Laudest. He was snapped up by
a big electronics firm at twenty
thousand to start, and he and
Gloria got married. With his
ability, he went up fast and made
money fast, and after a while he
got bored with the whole thing.
He was still worried about civil
rights, poverty, and the military
industrial complex, so he decided
to go into politics to see if he
could do something about it. He
got a reputation as a fighting
liberal, and then he got to be
Governor of the State.
He actually made a start at
wiping out slums, and providing
better jobs, housing, and
education, but he couldn't go fast
enough. You know how people
are. Give them an inch, they want
the whole ball of string right now.
There were some big riots, and
some of the cities got scorched.
There was a lot of looting too,
and Jim had to call the National
Guard. The jails were so crammed,
they were talking of making
temporary camps to hold
theprisoners. You never saw so
many busted heads. Jim felt
pretty bad about it, but what
could he do? I mean you've got to
preserve law and order, don't
you?

I'm a policeman's club, and
let's leave Freud out of this.
Us clubs make close contact
with people, and we get to know
them pretty well. They're mostly
fairly decent Joes; not .as bad as
they're cracked up to be.
Like the cops who swing us,
for instance. They're not pigs. Oh
sure, you'll find some bad apples
in any barrel, but most cops aren't
bullies or sadists. They honestly
want to keep the world a decent
place to live in. 1 mean there are
such things as robbery, rape, and
murder, and if nobody did
anything about it you couldn't
have civilization, could you? I
mean you've got to have law and
order. And every once in a while,
a head gets cracked.
Funny thing about that; when
I split a skull it really splits for
me. I mean I get to know what

the guy inside it is really like, and
that's the guy who splits when I
hit him. I can see two of him. One
is the guy he's going to be, and
the other is the guy he would have
been if 1 hadn't hit him—if you
know what I mean.
Like Benny Moroney. Benny
wasn't much of a criminal, he had
his bad points, but he had is good
ones too. Like if you were poor
and came from a busted family,
and didn't have too much
education, there would be some
gaps in your character too.
Ambitious
Not that he actually went
hungry very often, but food isn't
everything. There were enough
kisses, bicycles, trips to the zoo,
clothes, picnics, cars, and girls
missing from his life, to keep him
from being altruistic. On the other
hand, he was no cheater. When he

worked, he worked hard; when he
fought, he fought hard; and he
stood by his friends. He was
ambitious, too, but hard work
didn't seem to swell his bank
account very fast, so he began to
bolster his income with a little hot
wiring on the side. That's when I
met him.
Now, you club that kind of a
man, and send him up for a
stretch, he turns bitter. It happens
every time. Benny figures he'd
been cheated by society, and he
was the sort of guy who can hold
a grudge. Fortunately for society,
the only men in the pen who
could tell him how to get his slice
of the pie were hardened
criminals. That kind of an enemy,
society can handle. I ought to
know.
But what about that other
Benny, who didn't get clobbered?
Well, he did all right. He made
enough money from his side line
to go into construction
contracting, and from then on he
had brains enough to stay legit.
He had brains enough to make a
success of his business, too. He
discovered that a little influence
at City Hall didn't hurt his
business a bit, and by the time he
had his second million, he had
enough influence to get himself
elected mayor.
Self-Made
He was no better or worse than
most mayors. Being a self-made
