# Response To The President
## An Appeal To Re-examine Issues 
### 
Dear President Pitzer:
As I read the Daily Wednesday
morning, I became enraged to an
extent that I find difficult to
express: enraged at the unfeeling
and uncomprehending men who
run our government and this
university; engraged at those who
can justify murder as a means to
break up a peaceful, if unlawful,
assembly; enraged at those who
twist law and subvert justice, at
this who value property above
human life; enranged at those who
plead for "rationality" and
"legitimate channels of change"
when these terms have become a
mask for inaction and unconcern.
Friday night the mayor of
Berkeley stated that the police
had shown great restraint in
dealing with the demonstrators at
the People's Park; now, one young
man is dead of wounds received
from a police shotgun. Governor
Reagan told reporters: "I now
urge that those relative few who
are seeking to destroy us by
turning one against the other must
be dealt with firmly and swiftly
and with the justice they
deserve." How many times have
un r e s p on sive—not to say
repressive—governments appealed
to their "dear citizens" not to
heed the "inflamatory" words of
agitators bent on "sowing
discord"? What people has ever
heeded exhortations for change
and confrontation that has not
been discontented and frustrated
to begin with?
The University of California
had let the plot of land lie
undeveloped for two years. But
somehow, when the people of
Berkeley started to build a park
there, the university found it
imperative to fence off that land
and construct another athletic
field immediately. The University
has huge power in Berkeley; the
people who built the park have
little. Chancellor Heyns acted
arbitrarily, and he had the power
to back him up. Now a man who
committed a misdemeanor is
dead.
Distortion
Monday morning the Stanford
-Judicial Council, now composed
with a faculty majority of 5-3,
ruled that there was a disruption
of normal campus functions at
Encina Hall. But what activities
were stopped? Bob Beyers left
voluntarily before the students
had even arrived at the building;
Harry Press saw students in his
office, but did not ask them to
leave and made no attempt to
work there. If windows were
broken, if people were assaulted,
if trespass was committed, let

those individuals involved be
brought to trial.
Prof. Friedenthal has acted
high-handedly, distorting the
campus policy on disruptions to
penalize with academic sanctions
seventy demonstrators who
clearly did not violate that policy.
The punishment meted out by the
SJC, acting in loco parentis, is
worse for the individuals involved
than that which the civil law
provides for the same offense:
students were suspended without
trial before it had been
determined whether the policy on
disruptions had been violated.
And you, President Pitzer, who
say that our national priorities
must be changed, how do you
propose that this happen? The
people in positions of power do
not act; we have tried petitions,
referendums, and demonstrations,
and still the Board of Trustees
brushes us aside. They even
ignored the plea of the Academic
Senate to wait until next fall to
make their decision of SRI. And
you have the nerve to say to
Stanford alumni that the Board
has shown "flexibility in the face
of changing times." What person,
having seen the open meeting in
March or the televised hearing in
May, could believe you?
You say that if more students
joined groups like the CAC,
effective and legitimate
movements for change could be
established. But what proposals
for change has the CAC advanced?
None. All their literature decries
the April Third Movement, but
suggests no alternative. In reality,
they stand for no change at all.
You say that the basic activities of
Stanford are proceeding in spite
of student activism. But as the
A3M has pointed out, not all of
Stanford's activities are
constructive or desirable.
Do not forget that our
Stanford education has aided us in
reaching the analysis of society
and the university which
motivates us now. I ask you to
re-examine the issues and your
own conscience. Liberals who
laud Gandi cannot decry the SRI
demonstration: there was no
property damage until the police
moved in with riot sticks and
tear-gas. One shouldn't sacrifice
justice for a twisted legality;
demonstrations arise from
concern and frustration, not from
perm iciousness or desire for
wanton destruction. If your
response doesn't change, we will
continue to be on opposite sides
of the police lines.

•Lift Suspensions
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I urge you to immediately lift
the "temporary" suspensions
which you imposed on
approximately 65 students some
three weeks ago. I am a member
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
and have so far unsuccessfully
attempted to persuade the other
members of that body to
recommend that you lift the
suspensiosn. The latest decision of
the SJC is in my opinion
irresponsible, as you will be able
to read in my dissent. I am
prompted to write you now to
express the depth and substance
of my concern, and to appeal to
you as a sort of last desperate
resort.
You have said, "... at this
point in time, we face a clear test
of the university's capacity to
govern its own affairs. It is a real
test, in the final balance, as to
whether we can continue as a
community that claims dedication
to the examined life." And
further, "Universities will have to
work out a set of rules which are
acceptable to their respective
communities, enforceable by the
university, and understandable to
the general public. These rules
must reject coercion as a means to
an end; they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
I agree with you. The question
is how your and the SJC's actions
relate to these goals. Are we to
assume that the university must
govern itself by any means
necessary, regardless of the
consequences? What has the
university gained by proving that,
even if it can't seem to coerce
some members of the community
to do what it thinks is right, or to
stop what it thinks is wrong, at
least it can impose penalties on
some members of the community
without trial? The suspensions
and the civil injunction speak
louder than your words to the
alumni. The suspensions say: at
Stanford, we may not be able to
ensure due process, but we sure as
hell can screw people. And the
injunction shouts: we need
outside force to help us govern
ourselves. No amount of rhetoric
or even rational dialogue
concerning the "examined life"
can drown out those facts.
Injustice
The "temporary" suspensions
constitute a clear violation of the
spirit of due process which is a
fundamental tradition of
American judicial process. The

right of due process is one of
those aspects of American judicial
process which supposedly
differentiate it from the hated and
feared totalitarian and dictatorial
systems in effect elsewhere in the
world. To short-circuit it here, in
a university, is to do the
community a grave injustice.
The suspensions you have
imposed are certainly coercive.
They are coercive means to an
end. And they are achieving
neither their specific intended
ends nor helping the SJC to
function. They were designed by
the SJC to coerce students to
leave an occupied building: they
have failed, as the events of May 1
show. They were also designed by
the SJC lo coorce students into
cooperating with the SJC: again,
they have failed. All that they
have clearly done is to prevent
registered students from going to
class and taking tests. Again I
quote you: "These rules must
reject coercion as a means to an
end: they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
When you brought police onto
campus to clear Encina Hall, you
obviated the need for the
summary suspensions. The
students were already out of the
building before any of them were
suspended. At that point you
should have sent the names of
those accused to the SJC and let
us try to adjudicate the case. To
impose the suspensions after the
occupation of Encina was over
was unnecessary and
counterproductive.
M isleading
The ''temporary''
suspensions—perhaps here I
should note that a suspension is a
suspension. To use the word
"temporary" is to imply that
there must be such a thing as a
"permanent" suspension. I submit
that a permanent suspension is an
expulsion, and that to use the
term "temporary suspension" is
misleading—the suspensions are
counterproductive not only in the
sense that they prove that due
process is a secondary concern in
Stanford's judicial process, but
also because they have increased
resistance to the SJC by those on
whom they are imposed and
because, rather than calling in
students for hearings scheduled by
the SJC and sanctioning those
who refuse to cooperate, as would
be normal procedure, the SJC has
waited for people to come in and
request hearings. Many have not.
Now we are in the untenable
position of having students

suspended in the current quarter
for nothing more than
non-cooperation with the SJC.
The Charter is specific on the
punishment for non-coopeation:
holding of graduation or
registration until the accused
cooeprates. And worse, we have
assumed non-cooperation, rather
than found it.
You may object that I should
address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their
suggestions. I have brought my
objections before the Council, and
without success. And I do not
mean here to dissociate myself
from all of the blunders the SJC
may have made. Indeed, though I
dissented on the original SJC
decision (of April 17) which
illegally suggested you summarily
suspend students, I was a party to
; the blunders since then. I am most
at fault for not speaking out
sooner. For your part, you have
not followed the SJC suggestions
i to the letter: the injunction you
sought and received was not
considered by the SJC, and more
importantly, the SJC considered
one of the main reasons for the
summary suspensions was to clear
a building: calling police to do
that was what the SJC wanted to
avoid by granting you emergency
, powers.
The present judicial crisis -and
though it may not be clear to all
I at Stanford yet, there is one —is
only in part due to the actions of
you and the SJC. But the point
here is that, just as you have the
power to help precipitate a crisis,
so you have in this case the power
to help mitigate one. Your failure
to lift the suspensions will almost
certainly hamper future attempts
of the university to govern itself.
Stanford gains nothing by
"governing itself" if the normal
judicial process includes civil
injunctions and summary action
by you, and if the SJC,
overburdened as it is, is unable to
adequately and fairly adjudicate
alleged violations of university
policy. Have we really made
progress toward a "reasoned
approach" or should we concede
that our "reasoned approach" to
the judicial process is to preserve
the judicial structure at the
expense of its reason for existing?
If the "temporary" suspensions
are not lifted, 1 am forced to the
latter concession.

The ''temporary''
suspensions—perhaps here I
should note that a suspension is a
suspension. To use the word
"temporary" is to imply that
there must be such a thing as a
"permanent" suspension. I submit
that a permanent suspension is an
expulsion, and that to use the
term "temporary suspension" is
misleading—the suspensions are
counterproductive not only in the
sense that they prove that due
process is a secondary concern in
Stanford's judicial process, but
also because they have increased
resistance to the SJC by those on
whom they are imposed and
because, rather than calling in
students for hearings scheduled by
the SJC and sanctioning those
who refuse to cooperate, as would
be normal procedure, the SJC has
waited for people to come in and
request hearings. Many have not.
Now we are in the untenable
position of having students

suspended in the current quarter
for nothing more than
non-cooperation with the SJC.
The Charter is specific on the
punishment for non-coopeation:
holding of graduation or
registration until the accused
cooeprates. And worse, we have
assumed non-cooperation, rather
than found it.
You may object that I should
address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their
suggestions. I have brought my
objections before the Council, and
without success. And I do not
mean here to dissociate myself
from all of the blunders the SJC
may have made. Indeed, though I
dissented on the original SJC
decision (of April 17) which
illegally suggested you summarily
suspend students, I was a party to
; the blunders since then. I am most
at fault for not speaking out
sooner. For your part, you have
not followed the SJC suggestions
i to the letter: the injunction you
sought and received was not
considered by the SJC, and more
importantly, the SJC considered
one of the main reasons for the
summary suspensions was to clear
a building: calling police to do
that was what the SJC wanted to
avoid by granting you emergency
, powers.
The present judicial crisis -and
though it may not be clear to all
I at Stanford yet, there is one —is
only in part due to the actions of
you and the SJC. But the point
here is that, just as you have the
power to help precipitate a crisis,
so you have in this case the power
to help mitigate one. Your failure
to lift the suspensions will almost
certainly hamper future attempts
of the university to govern itself.
Stanford gains nothing by
"governing itself" if the normal
judicial process includes civil
injunctions and summary action
by you, and if the SJC,
overburdened as it is, is unable to
adequately and fairly adjudicate
alleged violations of university
policy. Have we really made
progress toward a "reasoned
approach" or should we concede
that our "reasoned approach" to
the judicial process is to preserve
the judicial structure at the

Dear President Pitzer:
As I read the Daily Wednesday
morning, I became enraged to an
extent that I find difficult to
express: enraged at the unfeeling
and uncomprehending men who
run our government and this
university; engraged at those who
can justify murder as a means to
break up a peaceful, if unlawful,
assembly; enraged at those who
twist law and subvert justice, at
this who value property above
human life; enranged at those who
plead for "rationality" and
"legitimate channels of change"
when these terms have become a
mask for inaction and unconcern.
Friday night the mayor of
Berkeley stated that the police
had shown great restraint in
dealing with the demonstrators at
the People's Park; now, one young

Reagan told reporters: "I now
urge that those relative few who
are seeking to destroy us by
turning one against the other must
be dealt with firmly and swiftly
and with the justice they
deserve." How many times have
un r e s p on sive—not to say
repressive—governments appealed
to their "dear citizens" not to
heed the "inflamatory" words of
agitators bent on "sowing
discord"? What people has ever
heeded exhortations for change
and confrontation that has not
been discontented and frustrated
to begin with?
The University of California
had let the plot of land lie
undeveloped for two years. But
somehow, when the people of
Berkeley started to build a park
there, the university found it
imperative to fence off that land
and construct another athletic
field immediately. The University
has huge power in Berkeley; the
people who built the park have
little. Chancellor Heyns acted
arbitrarily, and he had the power
to back him up. Now a man who
committed a misdemeanor is
dead.
Distortion
Monday morning the Stanford
-Judicial Council, now composed
with a faculty majority of 5-3,
ruled that there was a disruption
of normal campus functions at
Encina Hall. But what activities
were stopped? Bob Beyers left
voluntarily before the students
had even arrived at the building;
Harry Press saw students in his
office, but did not ask them to
leave and made no attempt to
work there. If windows were
broken, if people were assaulted,
if trespass was committed, let

those individuals involved be
brought to trial.
Prof. Friedenthal has acted
high-handedly, distorting the
campus policy on disruptions to
penalize with academic sanctions
seventy demonstrators who
clearly did not violate that policy.
The punishment meted out by the
SJC, acting in loco parentis, is
worse for the individuals involved
than that which the civil law
provides for the same offense:
students were suspended without
trial before it had been
determined whether the policy on
disruptions had been violated.
And you, President Pitzer, who
say that our national priorities
must be changed, how do you
propose that this happen? The
people in positions of power do
not act; we have tried petitions,
referendums, and demonstrations,
and still the Board of Trustees
brushes us aside. They even
ignored the plea of the Academic
Senate to wait until next fall to
make their decision of SRI. And
you have the nerve to say to
Stanford alumni that the Board
has shown "flexibility in the face
of changing times." What person,
having seen the open meeting in
March or the televised hearing in
May, could believe you?
You say that if more students
joined groups like the CAC,
effective and legitimate
movements for change could be
established. But what proposals
for change has the CAC advanced?
None. All their literature decries
the April Third Movement, but
suggests no alternative. In reality,
they stand for no change at all.
You say that the basic activities of
Stanford are proceeding in spite
of student activism. But as the
A3M has pointed out, not all of
Stanford's activities are
constructive or desirable.
Do not forget that our
Stanford education has aided us in
reaching the analysis of society
and the university which
motivates us now. I ask you to
re-examine the issues and your
own conscience. Liberals who
laud Gandi cannot decry the SRI
demonstration: there was no
property damage until the police
moved in with riot sticks and
tear-gas. One shouldn't sacrifice
justice for a twisted legality;
demonstrations arise from
concern and frustration, not from
perm iciousness or desire for
wanton destruction. If your
response doesn't change, we will
continue to be on opposite sides
of the police lines.

•Lift Suspensions
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I urge you to immediately lift
the "temporary" suspensions
which you imposed on
approximately 65 students some
three weeks ago. I am a member
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
and have so far unsuccessfully
attempted to persuade the other
members of that body to
recommend that you lift the
suspensiosn. The latest decision of
the SJC is in my opinion
irresponsible, as you will be able
to read in my dissent. I am
prompted to write you now to
express the depth and substance
of my concern, and to appeal to
you as a sort of last desperate
resort.
You have said, "... at this
point in time, we face a clear test
of the university's capacity to
govern its own affairs. It is a real
test, in the final balance, as to
whether we can continue as a
community that claims dedication
to the examined life." And
further, "Universities will have to
work out a set of rules which are
acceptable to their respective
communities, enforceable by the
university, and understandable to
the general public. These rules
must reject coercion as a means to
an end; they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
I agree with you. The question
is how your and the SJC's actions
relate to these goals. Are we to
assume that the university must
govern itself by any means
necessary, regardless of the
consequences? What has the
university gained by proving that,
even if it can't seem to coerce
some members of the community
to do what it thinks is right, or to
stop what it thinks is wrong, at
least it can impose penalties on
some members of the community
without trial? The suspensions
and the civil injunction speak
louder than your words to the
alumni. The suspensions say: at
Stanford, we may not be able to
ensure due process, but we sure as
hell can screw people. And the
injunction shouts: we need
outside force to help us govern
ourselves. No amount of rhetoric
or even rational dialogue
concerning the "examined life"
can drown out those facts.
Injustice
The "temporary" suspensions
constitute a clear violation of the
spirit of due process which is a
fundamental tradition of
American judicial process. The

right of due process is one of
those aspects of American judicial
process which supposedly
differentiate it from the hated and
feared totalitarian and dictatorial
systems in effect elsewhere in the
world. To short-circuit it here, in
a university, is to do the
community a grave injustice.
The suspensions you have
imposed are certainly coercive.
They are coercive means to an
end. And they are achieving
neither their specific intended
ends nor helping the SJC to
function. They were designed by
the SJC to coerce students to
leave an occupied building: they
have failed, as the events of May 1
show. They were also designed by
the SJC lo coorce students into
cooperating with the SJC: again,
they have failed. All that they
have clearly done is to prevent
registered students from going to
class and taking tests. Again I
quote you: "These rules must
reject coercion as a means to an
end: they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
When you brought police onto
campus to clear Encina Hall, you
obviated the need for the
summary suspensions. The
students were already out of the
building before any of them were
suspended. At that point you
should have sent the names of
those accused to the SJC and let
us try to adjudicate the case. To
impose the suspensions after the
occupation of Encina was over
was unnecessary and
counterproductive.

approximately 65 students some
three weeks ago. I am a member
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
and have so far unsuccessfully
attempted to persuade the other
members of that body to
recommend that you lift the
suspensiosn. The latest decision of
the SJC is in my opinion
irresponsible, as you will be able
to read in my dissent. I am
prompted to write you now to
express the depth and substance
of my concern, and to appeal to
you as a sort of last desperate
resort.
You have said, "... at this
point in time, we face a clear test
of the university's capacity to
govern its own affairs. It is a real
test, in the final balance, as to
whether we can continue as a
community that claims dedication
to the examined life." And
further, "Universities will have to
work out a set of rules which are
acceptable to their respective
communities, enforceable by the
university, and understandable to
the general public. These rules
must reject coercion as a means to
an end; they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
I agree with you. The question
is how your and the SJC's actions
relate to these goals. Are we to
assume that the university must
govern itself by any means
necessary, regardless of the
consequences? What has the
university gained by proving that,
even if it can't seem to coerce
some members of the community
to do what it thinks is right, or to
stop what it thinks is wrong, at
least it can impose penalties on
some members of the community
without trial? The suspensions
and the civil injunction speak
louder than your words to the
alumni. The suspensions say: at
Stanford, we may not be able to
ensure due process, but we sure as
hell can screw people. And the
injunction shouts: we need
outside force to help us govern
ourselves. No amount of rhetoric
or even rational dialogue
concerning the "examined life"
can drown out those facts.
Injustice
The "temporary" suspensions
constitute a clear violation of the
spirit of due process which is a
fundamental tradition of
American judicial process. The

right of due process is one of
those aspects of American judicial
process which supposedly
differentiate it from the hated and
feared totalitarian and dictatorial
systems in effect elsewhere in the
world. To short-circuit it here, in
a university, is to do the
community a grave injustice.
The suspensions you have
imposed are certainly coercive.
They are coercive means to an
end. And they are achieving
neither their specific intended
ends nor helping the SJC to
function. They were designed by
the SJC to coerce students to
leave an occupied building: they
have failed, as the events of May 1
show. They were also designed by
the SJC lo coorce students into
cooperating with the SJC: again,
they have failed. All that they
have clearly done is to prevent
registered students from going to
class and taking tests. Again I
quote you: "These rules must
reject coercion as a means to an
end: they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
When you brought police onto
campus to clear Encina Hall, you
obviated the need for the
summary suspensions. The
students were already out of the
building before any of them were
suspended. At that point you
should have sent the names of
those accused to the SJC and let
us try to adjudicate the case. To
impose the suspensions after the
occupation of Encina was over
was unnecessary and
counterproductive.
M isleading
The ''temporary''
suspensions—perhaps here I
should note that a suspension is a
suspension. To use the word
"temporary" is to imply that
there must be such a thing as a
"permanent" suspension. I submit
that a permanent suspension is an
expulsion, and that to use the
term "temporary suspension" is
misleading—the suspensions are
counterproductive not only in the
sense that they prove that due
process is a secondary concern in
Stanford's judicial process, but
also because they have increased
resistance to the SJC by those on
whom they are imposed and
because, rather than calling in
students for hearings scheduled by
the SJC and sanctioning those
who refuse to cooperate, as would
be normal procedure, the SJC has
waited for people to come in and
request hearings. Many have not.
Now we are in the untenable
position of having students

suspended in the current quarter
for nothing more than
non-cooperation with the SJC.
The Charter is specific on the
punishment for non-coopeation:
holding of graduation or
registration until the accused
cooeprates. And worse, we have
assumed non-cooperation, rather
than found it.
You may object that I should
address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their
suggestions. I have brought my
objections before the Council, and
without success. And I do not
mean here to dissociate myself
from all of the blunders the SJC
may have made. Indeed, though I
dissented on the original SJC
decision (of April 17) which
illegally suggested you summarily
suspend students, I was a party to
; the blunders since then. I am most
at fault for not speaking out
sooner. For your part, you have
not followed the SJC suggestions
i to the letter: the injunction you
sought and received was not
considered by the SJC, and more
importantly, the SJC considered
one of the main reasons for the
summary suspensions was to clear
a building: calling police to do
that was what the SJC wanted to
avoid by granting you emergency
, powers.
The present judicial crisis -and
though it may not be clear to all
I at Stanford yet, there is one —is
only in part due to the actions of
you and the SJC. But the point
here is that, just as you have the
power to help precipitate a crisis,
so you have in this case the power
to help mitigate one. Your failure
to lift the suspensions will almost
certainly hamper future attempts
of the university to govern itself.
Stanford gains nothing by
"governing itself" if the normal
judicial process includes civil
injunctions and summary action
by you, and if the SJC,
overburdened as it is, is unable to
adequately and fairly adjudicate
alleged violations of university
policy. Have we really made
progress toward a "reasoned
approach" or should we concede
that our "reasoned approach" to
the judicial process is to preserve
the judicial structure at the
expense of its reason for existing?

Dear President Pitzer:
As I read the Daily Wednesday
morning, I became enraged to an
extent that I find difficult to
express: enraged at the unfeeling
and uncomprehending men who
run our government and this
university; engraged at those who
can justify murder as a means to
break up a peaceful, if unlawful,
assembly; enraged at those who
twist law and subvert justice, at
this who value property above
human life; enranged at those who
plead for "rationality" and
"legitimate channels of change"
when these terms have become a
mask for inaction and unconcern.
Friday night the mayor of
Berkeley stated that the police
had shown great restraint in
dealing with the demonstrators at
the People's Park; now, one young
man is dead of wounds received
from a police shotgun. Governor
Reagan told reporters: "I now
urge that those relative few who
are seeking to destroy us by
turning one against the other must
be dealt with firmly and swiftly
and with the justice they
deserve." How many times have
un r e s p on sive—not to say
repressive—governments appealed
to their "dear citizens" not to
heed the "inflamatory" words of
agitators bent on "sowing
discord"? What people has ever
heeded exhortations for change
and confrontation that has not
been discontented and frustrated
to begin with?
The University of California
had let the plot of land lie
undeveloped for two years. But
somehow, when the people of
Berkeley started to build a park
there, the university found it
imperative to fence off that land
and construct another athletic
field immediately. The University
has huge power in Berkeley; the
people who built the park have
little. Chancellor Heyns acted
arbitrarily, and he had the power
to back him up. Now a man who
committed a misdemeanor is
dead.
Distortion
Monday morning the Stanford
-Judicial Council, now composed
with a faculty majority of 5-3,
ruled that there was a disruption
of normal campus functions at
Encina Hall. But what activities
were stopped? Bob Beyers left
voluntarily before the students
had even arrived at the building;
Harry Press saw students in his
office, but did not ask them to
leave and made no attempt to
work there. If windows were
broken, if people were assaulted,
if trespass was committed, let

those individuals involved be
brought to trial.
Prof. Friedenthal has acted
high-handedly, distorting the
campus policy on disruptions to
penalize with academic sanctions
seventy demonstrators who
clearly did not violate that policy.
The punishment meted out by the
SJC, acting in loco parentis, is
worse for the individuals involved
than that which the civil law
provides for the same offense:
students were suspended without
trial before it had been
determined whether the policy on
disruptions had been violated.
And you, President Pitzer, who
say that our national priorities
must be changed, how do you
propose that this happen? The
people in positions of power do
not act; we have tried petitions,
referendums, and demonstrations,
and still the Board of Trustees
brushes us aside. They even
ignored the plea of the Academic
Senate to wait until next fall to
make their decision of SRI. And
you have the nerve to say to
Stanford alumni that the Board
has shown "flexibility in the face
of changing times." What person,
having seen the open meeting in
March or the televised hearing in
May, could believe you?
You say that if more students
joined groups like the CAC,
effective and legitimate
movements for change could be
established. But what proposals
for change has the CAC advanced?
None. All their literature decries
the April Third Movement, but
suggests no alternative. In reality,
they stand for no change at all.
You say that the basic activities of
Stanford are proceeding in spite
of student activism. But as the
A3M has pointed out, not all of
Stanford's activities are
constructive or desirable.
Do not forget that our
Stanford education has aided us in
reaching the analysis of society
and the university which
motivates us now. I ask you to
re-examine the issues and your
own conscience. Liberals who
laud Gandi cannot decry the SRI
demonstration: there was no
property damage until the police
moved in with riot sticks and
tear-gas. One shouldn't sacrifice
justice for a twisted legality;
demonstrations arise from
concern and frustration, not from
perm iciousness or desire for
wanton destruction. If your
response doesn't change, we will
continue to be on opposite sides
of the police lines.

The University of California
had let the plot of land lie
undeveloped for two years. But
somehow, when the people of
Berkeley started to build a park
there, the university found it
imperative to fence off that land

has huge power in Berkeley; the

little. Chancellor Heyns acted

Distortion
Monday morning the Stanford
-Judicial Council, now composed
with a faculty majority of 5-3,
ruled that there was a disruption
of normal campus functions at
Encina Hall. But what activities
were stopped? Bob Beyers left
voluntarily before the students
had even arrived at the building;
Harry Press saw students in his
office, but did not ask them to
leave and made no attempt to
work there. If windows were
broken, if people were assaulted,
if trespass was committed, let

those individuals involved be
brought to trial.
Prof. Friedenthal has acted
high-handedly, distorting the
campus policy on disruptions to
penalize with academic sanctions
seventy demonstrators who
clearly did not violate that policy.
The punishment meted out by the
SJC, acting in loco parentis, is
worse for the individuals involved
than that which the civil law
provides for the same offense:
students were suspended without
trial before it had been
determined whether the policy on
disruptions had been violated.
And you, President Pitzer, who
say that our national priorities
must be changed, how do you
propose that this happen? The
people in positions of power do
not act; we have tried petitions,
referendums, and demonstrations,
and still the Board of Trustees
brushes us aside. They even
ignored the plea of the Academic
Senate to wait until next fall to
make their decision of SRI. And
you have the nerve to say to
Stanford alumni that the Board
has shown "flexibility in the face
of changing times." What person,
having seen the open meeting in
March or the televised hearing in
May, could believe you?
You say that if more students
joined groups like the CAC,
effective and legitimate
movements for change could be
established. But what proposals
for change has the CAC advanced?
None. All their literature decries
the April Third Movement, but
suggests no alternative. In reality,
they stand for no change at all.
You say that the basic activities of
Stanford are proceeding in spite
of student activism. But as the
A3M has pointed out, not all of
Stanford's activities are
constructive or desirable.
Do not forget that our
Stanford education has aided us in
reaching the analysis of society
and the university which
motivates us now. I ask you to
re-examine the issues and your
own conscience. Liberals who
laud Gandi cannot decry the SRI
demonstration: there was no
property damage until the police
moved in with riot sticks and
tear-gas. One shouldn't sacrifice
justice for a twisted legality;
demonstrations arise from
concern and frustration, not from
perm iciousness or desire for
wanton destruction. If your
response doesn't change, we will
continue to be on opposite sides
of the police lines.

•Lift Suspensions
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I urge you to immediately lift
the "temporary" suspensions
which you imposed on
approximately 65 students some
three weeks ago. I am a member
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
and have so far unsuccessfully
attempted to persuade the other
members of that body to
recommend that you lift the
suspensiosn. The latest decision of
the SJC is in my opinion
irresponsible, as you will be able
to read in my dissent. I am
prompted to write you now to
express the depth and substance
of my concern, and to appeal to
you as a sort of last desperate
resort.
You have said, "... at this
point in time, we face a clear test
of the university's capacity to
govern its own affairs. It is a real
test, in the final balance, as to
whether we can continue as a
community that claims dedication
to the examined life." And
further, "Universities will have to
work out a set of rules which are
acceptable to their respective
communities, enforceable by the
university, and understandable to
the general public. These rules
must reject coercion as a means to
an end; they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
I agree with you. The question
is how your and the SJC's actions
relate to these goals. Are we to
assume that the university must
govern itself by any means
necessary, regardless of the
consequences? What has the
university gained by proving that,
even if it can't seem to coerce
some members of the community
to do what it thinks is right, or to
stop what it thinks is wrong, at
least it can impose penalties on
some members of the community
without trial? The suspensions
and the civil injunction speak
louder than your words to the
alumni. The suspensions say: at
Stanford, we may not be able to
ensure due process, but we sure as
hell can screw people. And the
injunction shouts: we need
outside force to help us govern
ourselves. No amount of rhetoric
or even rational dialogue
concerning the "examined life"
can drown out those facts.
Injustice
The "temporary" suspensions
constitute a clear violation of the
spirit of due process which is a
fundamental tradition of
American judicial process. The

right of due process is one of
those aspects of American judicial
process which supposedly
differentiate it from the hated and
feared totalitarian and dictatorial
systems in effect elsewhere in the
world. To short-circuit it here, in
a university, is to do the
community a grave injustice.
The suspensions you have
imposed are certainly coercive.
They are coercive means to an
end. And they are achieving
neither their specific intended
ends nor helping the SJC to
function. They were designed by
the SJC to coerce students to
leave an occupied building: they
have failed, as the events of May 1
show. They were also designed by
the SJC lo coorce students into
cooperating with the SJC: again,
they have failed. All that they
have clearly done is to prevent
registered students from going to
class and taking tests. Again I
quote you: "These rules must
reject coercion as a means to an
end: they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
When you brought police onto
campus to clear Encina Hall, you
obviated the need for the
summary suspensions. The
students were already out of the
building before any of them were
suspended. At that point you
should have sent the names of
those accused to the SJC and let
us try to adjudicate the case. To
impose the suspensions after the
occupation of Encina was over
was unnecessary and
counterproductive.
M isleading
The ''temporary''
suspensions—perhaps here I
should note that a suspension is a
suspension. To use the word
"temporary" is to imply that
there must be such a thing as a
"permanent" suspension. I submit
that a permanent suspension is an
expulsion, and that to use the
term "temporary suspension" is
misleading—the suspensions are
counterproductive not only in the
sense that they prove that due
process is a secondary concern in
Stanford's judicial process, but
also because they have increased
resistance to the SJC by those on
whom they are imposed and
because, rather than calling in
students for hearings scheduled by
the SJC and sanctioning those
who refuse to cooperate, as would
be normal procedure, the SJC has
waited for people to come in and
request hearings. Many have not.
Now we are in the untenable
position of having students

suspended in the current quarter
for nothing more than
non-cooperation with the SJC.
The Charter is specific on the
punishment for non-coopeation:
holding of graduation or
registration until the accused
cooeprates. And worse, we have
assumed non-cooperation, rather
than found it.
You may object that I should
address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their
suggestions. I have brought my
objections before the Council, and
without success. And I do not
mean here to dissociate myself
from all of the blunders the SJC
may have made. Indeed, though I
dissented on the original SJC
decision (of April 17) which
illegally suggested you summarily
suspend students, I was a party to
; the blunders since then. I am most
at fault for not speaking out
sooner. For your part, you have
not followed the SJC suggestions
i to the letter: the injunction you
sought and received was not
considered by the SJC, and more
importantly, the SJC considered
one of the main reasons for the
summary suspensions was to clear
a building: calling police to do
that was what the SJC wanted to
avoid by granting you emergency
, powers.
The present judicial crisis -and
though it may not be clear to all
I at Stanford yet, there is one —is
only in part due to the actions of
you and the SJC. But the point
here is that, just as you have the
power to help precipitate a crisis,
so you have in this case the power
to help mitigate one. Your failure
to lift the suspensions will almost
certainly hamper future attempts
of the university to govern itself.
Stanford gains nothing by
"governing itself" if the normal
judicial process includes civil
injunctions and summary action
by you, and if the SJC,
overburdened as it is, is unable to
adequately and fairly adjudicate
alleged violations of university
policy. Have we really made
progress toward a "reasoned
approach" or should we concede
that our "reasoned approach" to
the judicial process is to preserve
the judicial structure at the
expense of its reason for existing?
If the "temporary" suspensions
are not lifted, 1 am forced to the
latter concession.

Dear President Pitzer:
As I read the Daily Wednesday
morning, I became enraged to an
extent that I find difficult to
express: enraged at the unfeeling
and uncomprehending men who
run our government and this
university; engraged at those who
can justify murder as a means to
break up a peaceful, if unlawful,
assembly; enraged at those who
twist law and subvert justice, at
this who value property above
human life; enranged at those who
plead for "rationality" and
"legitimate channels of change"
when these terms have become a
mask for inaction and unconcern.
Friday night the mayor of
Berkeley stated that the police
had shown great restraint in
dealing with the demonstrators at
the People's Park; now, one young
man is dead of wounds received
from a police shotgun. Governor
Reagan told reporters: "I now
urge that those relative few who
are seeking to destroy us by
turning one against the other must
be dealt with firmly and swiftly
and with the justice they
deserve." How many times have
un r e s p on sive—not to say
repressive—governments appealed
to their "dear citizens" not to
heed the "inflamatory" words of
agitators bent on "sowing
discord"? What people has ever
heeded exhortations for change

been discontented and frustrated

address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their
suggestions. I have brought my
objections before the Council, and
without success. And I do not
mean here to dissociate myself
from all of the blunders the SJC
may have made. Indeed, though I
dissented on the original SJC
decision (of April 17) which
illegally suggested you summarily
suspend students, I was a party to
; the blunders since then. I am most
at fault for not speaking out
sooner. For your part, you have
not followed the SJC suggestions
i to the letter: the injunction you
sought and received was not
considered by the SJC, and more
importantly, the SJC considered
one of the main reasons for the
summary suspensions was to clear
a building: calling police to do
that was what the SJC wanted to
avoid by granting you emergency
, powers.
The present judicial crisis -and
though it may not be clear to all
I at Stanford yet, there is one —is
only in part due to the actions of
you and the SJC. But the point
here is that, just as you have the
power to help precipitate a crisis,
so you have in this case the power
to help mitigate one. Your failure
to lift the suspensions will almost
certainly hamper future attempts
of the university to govern itself.
Stanford gains nothing by
"governing itself" if the normal
judicial process includes civil
injunctions and summary action
by you, and if the SJC,
overburdened as it is, is unable to
adequately and fairly adjudicate
alleged violations of university
policy. Have we really made
progress toward a "reasoned
approach" or should we concede
that our "reasoned approach" to
the judicial process is to preserve
the judicial structure at the
expense of its reason for existing?
If the "temporary" suspensions
are not lifted, 1 am forced to the
latter concession.

Dear President Pitzer:
As I read the Daily Wednesday
morning, I became enraged to an
extent that I find difficult to
express: enraged at the unfeeling
and uncomprehending men who
run our government and this
university; engraged at those who
can justify murder as a means to
break up a peaceful, if unlawful,
assembly; enraged at those who
twist law and subvert justice, at
this who value property above
human life; enranged at those who
plead for "rationality" and
"legitimate channels of change"
when these terms have become a
mask for inaction and unconcern.
Friday night the mayor of
Berkeley stated that the police
had shown great restraint in
dealing with the demonstrators at
the People's Park; now, one young
man is dead of wounds received
from a police shotgun. Governor
Reagan told reporters: "I now
urge that those relative few who
are seeking to destroy us by
turning one against the other must
be dealt with firmly and swiftly
and with the justice they
deserve." How many times have
un r e s p on sive—not to say
repressive—governments appealed
to their "dear citizens" not to
heed the "inflamatory" words of
agitators bent on "sowing
discord"? What people has ever
heeded exhortations for change
and confrontation that has not
been discontented and frustrated
to begin with?
The University of California
had let the plot of land lie
undeveloped for two years. But
somehow, when the people of
Berkeley started to build a park
there, the university found it
imperative to fence off that land
and construct another athletic
field immediately. The University
has huge power in Berkeley; the
people who built the park have
little. Chancellor Heyns acted
arbitrarily, and he had the power
to back him up. Now a man who
committed a misdemeanor is
dead.
Distortion
Monday morning the Stanford
-Judicial Council, now composed
with a faculty majority of 5-3,
ruled that there was a disruption
of normal campus functions at
Encina Hall. But what activities
were stopped? Bob Beyers left
voluntarily before the students
had even arrived at the building;
Harry Press saw students in his
office, but did not ask them to
leave and made no attempt to
work there. If windows were
broken, if people were assaulted,
if trespass was committed, let

those individuals involved be
brought to trial.
Prof. Friedenthal has acted
high-handedly, distorting the
campus policy on disruptions to
penalize with academic sanctions
seventy demonstrators who
clearly did not violate that policy.
The punishment meted out by the
SJC, acting in loco parentis, is
worse for the individuals involved
than that which the civil law
provides for the same offense:
students were suspended without
trial before it had been
determined whether the policy on
disruptions had been violated.
And you, President Pitzer, who
say that our national priorities
must be changed, how do you
propose that this happen? The
people in positions of power do
not act; we have tried petitions,
referendums, and demonstrations,
and still the Board of Trustees
brushes us aside. They even
ignored the plea of the Academic
Senate to wait until next fall to
make their decision of SRI. And
you have the nerve to say to
Stanford alumni that the Board
has shown "flexibility in the face
of changing times." What person,
having seen the open meeting in
March or the televised hearing in
May, could believe you?
You say that if more students
joined groups like the CAC,
effective and legitimate
movements for change could be
established. But what proposals
for change has the CAC advanced?
None. All their literature decries
the April Third Movement, but
suggests no alternative. In reality,
they stand for no change at all.
You say that the basic activities of
Stanford are proceeding in spite
of student activism. But as the
A3M has pointed out, not all of
Stanford's activities are
constructive or desirable.
Do not forget that our
Stanford education has aided us in
reaching the analysis of society
and the university which
motivates us now. I ask you to
re-examine the issues and your
own conscience. Liberals who
laud Gandi cannot decry the SRI
demonstration: there was no
property damage until the police
moved in with riot sticks and
tear-gas. One shouldn't sacrifice
justice for a twisted legality;
demonstrations arise from
concern and frustration, not from
perm iciousness or desire for
wanton destruction. If your
response doesn't change, we will
continue to be on opposite sides
of the police lines.

•Lift Suspensions
Dear Dr. Pitzer:
I urge you to immediately lift
the "temporary" suspensions
which you imposed on
approximately 65 students some
three weeks ago. I am a member
of the Stanford Judicial Council,
and have so far unsuccessfully
attempted to persuade the other
members of that body to
recommend that you lift the
suspensiosn. The latest decision of
the SJC is in my opinion
irresponsible, as you will be able
to read in my dissent. I am
prompted to write you now to
express the depth and substance
of my concern, and to appeal to
you as a sort of last desperate
resort.
You have said, "... at this
point in time, we face a clear test
of the university's capacity to
govern its own affairs. It is a real
test, in the final balance, as to
whether we can continue as a
community that claims dedication
to the examined life." And
further, "Universities will have to
work out a set of rules which are
acceptable to their respective
communities, enforceable by the
university, and understandable to
the general public. These rules
must reject coercion as a means to
an end; they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
I agree with you. The question
is how your and the SJC's actions
relate to these goals. Are we to
assume that the university must
govern itself by any means
necessary, regardless of the
consequences? What has the
university gained by proving that,
even if it can't seem to coerce
some members of the community
to do what it thinks is right, or to
stop what it thinks is wrong, at
least it can impose penalties on
some members of the community
without trial? The suspensions
and the civil injunction speak
louder than your words to the
alumni. The suspensions say: at
Stanford, we may not be able to
ensure due process, but we sure as
hell can screw people. And the
injunction shouts: we need
outside force to help us govern
ourselves. No amount of rhetoric
or even rational dialogue
concerning the "examined life"
can drown out those facts.
Injustice
The "temporary" suspensions
constitute a clear violation of the
spirit of due process which is a
fundamental tradition of
American judicial process. The

right of due process is one of
those aspects of American judicial
process which supposedly
differentiate it from the hated and
feared totalitarian and dictatorial
systems in effect elsewhere in the
world. To short-circuit it here, in
a university, is to do the
community a grave injustice.
The suspensions you have
imposed are certainly coercive.
They are coercive means to an
end. And they are achieving
neither their specific intended
ends nor helping the SJC to
function. They were designed by
the SJC to coerce students to
leave an occupied building: they
have failed, as the events of May 1
show. They were also designed by
the SJC lo coorce students into
cooperating with the SJC: again,
they have failed. All that they
have clearly done is to prevent
registered students from going to
class and taking tests. Again I
quote you: "These rules must
reject coercion as a means to an
end: they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
When you brought police onto
campus to clear Encina Hall, you
obviated the need for the
summary suspensions. The
students were already out of the
building before any of them were
suspended. At that point you
should have sent the names of
those accused to the SJC and let
us try to adjudicate the case. To
impose the suspensions after the
occupation of Encina was over
was unnecessary and
counterproductive.
M isleading
The ''temporary''
suspensions—perhaps here I
should note that a suspension is a
suspension. To use the word
"temporary" is to imply that
there must be such a thing as a
"permanent" suspension. I submit
that a permanent suspension is an
expulsion, and that to use the
term "temporary suspension" is
misleading—the suspensions are
counterproductive not only in the
sense that they prove that due
process is a secondary concern in
Stanford's judicial process, but
also because they have increased
resistance to the SJC by those on
whom they are imposed and
because, rather than calling in
students for hearings scheduled by
the SJC and sanctioning those
who refuse to cooperate, as would
be normal procedure, the SJC has
waited for people to come in and
request hearings. Many have not.
Now we are in the untenable
position of having students

suspended in the current quarter
for nothing more than
non-cooperation with the SJC.
The Charter is specific on the
punishment for non-coopeation:
holding of graduation or
registration until the accused
cooeprates. And worse, we have
assumed non-cooperation, rather
than found it.
You may object that I should
address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their

university gained by proving that,
even if it can't seem to coerce
some members of the community
to do what it thinks is right, or to
stop what it thinks is wrong, at
least it can impose penalties on
some members of the community
without trial? The suspensions
and the civil injunction speak
louder than your words to the
alumni. The suspensions say: at
Stanford, we may not be able to
ensure due process, but we sure as
hell can screw people. And the
injunction shouts: we need
outside force to help us govern
ourselves. No amount of rhetoric
or even rational dialogue
concerning the "examined life"
can drown out those facts.
Injustice
The "temporary" suspensions
constitute a clear violation of the
spirit of due process which is a
fundamental tradition of
American judicial process. The

right of due process is one of
those aspects of American judicial
process which supposedly
differentiate it from the hated and
feared totalitarian and dictatorial
systems in effect elsewhere in the
world. To short-circuit it here, in
a university, is to do the
community a grave injustice.
The suspensions you have
imposed are certainly coercive.
They are coercive means to an
end. And they are achieving
neither their specific intended
ends nor helping the SJC to
function. They were designed by
the SJC to coerce students to
leave an occupied building: they
have failed, as the events of May 1
show. They were also designed by
the SJC lo coorce students into
cooperating with the SJC: again,
they have failed. All that they
have clearly done is to prevent
registered students from going to
class and taking tests. Again I
quote you: "These rules must
reject coercion as a means to an
end: they must reject actions
which obstruct and disrupt
orderly education processes,
including the process of reform."
When you brought police onto
campus to clear Encina Hall, you
obviated the need for the
summary suspensions. The
students were already out of the
building before any of them were
suspended. At that point you
should have sent the names of
those accused to the SJC and let
us try to adjudicate the case. To
impose the suspensions after the
occupation of Encina was over
was unnecessary and
counterproductive.
M isleading
The ''temporary''
suspensions—perhaps here I
should note that a suspension is a
suspension. To use the word
"temporary" is to imply that
there must be such a thing as a
"permanent" suspension. I submit
that a permanent suspension is an
expulsion, and that to use the
term "temporary suspension" is
misleading—the suspensions are
counterproductive not only in the
sense that they prove that due
process is a secondary concern in
Stanford's judicial process, but
also because they have increased
resistance to the SJC by those on
whom they are imposed and
because, rather than calling in
students for hearings scheduled by
the SJC and sanctioning those
who refuse to cooperate, as would
be normal procedure, the SJC has
waited for people to come in and
request hearings. Many have not.
Now we are in the untenable
position of having students

suspended in the current quarter
for nothing more than
non-cooperation with the SJC.
The Charter is specific on the
punishment for non-coopeation:
holding of graduation or
registration until the accused
cooeprates. And worse, we have
assumed non-cooperation, rather
than found it.
You may object that I should
address my concerns to the SJC,
that it was their idea in the first
place to have summary
suspensions, that they are the
ones who should determine what
non-cooperation is, and that you
have merely followed their
suggestions. I have brought my
objections before the Council, and
without success. And I do not
mean here to dissociate myself
from all of the blunders the SJC
may have made. Indeed, though I
dissented on the original SJC
decision (of April 17) which
illegally suggested you summarily
suspend students, I was a party to
; the blunders since then. I am most
at fault for not speaking out
sooner. For your part, you have
not followed the SJC suggestions
i to the letter: the injunction you
sought and received was not
considered by the SJC, and more
importantly, the SJC considered
one of the main reasons for the
summary suspensions was to clear
a building: calling police to do
that was what the SJC wanted to
avoid by granting you emergency
, powers.
The present judicial crisis -and
though it may not be clear to all
I at Stanford yet, there is one —is
only in part due to the actions of
you and the SJC. But the point
here is that, just as you have the
power to help precipitate a crisis,
so you have in this case the power
to help mitigate one. Your failure
to lift the suspensions will almost
certainly hamper future attempts
of the university to govern itself.
Stanford gains nothing by
"governing itself" if the normal
judicial process includes civil
injunctions and summary action
by you, and if the SJC,
overburdened as it is, is unable to
adequately and fairly adjudicate
alleged violations of university
policy. Have we really made
progress toward a "reasoned
approach" or should we concede
that our "reasoned approach" to
the judicial process is to preserve
the judicial structure at the
expense of its reason for existing?
If the "temporary" suspensions
are not lifted, 1 am forced to the
latter concession.
