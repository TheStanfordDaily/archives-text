## Stop The Radicals 
### Roger Reed 
Stanford University has
become a base of operations and a
privileged sanctuary for
revolutionaries who are waging
guerrilla warfare throughout the
Bay Area and whose aims are
violent confrontation and
destruction.
Friday and Monday our
campus was the assembly area for
radicals who organized into
squads of helmeted troops and
who followed a detailed plan of
attack on the Stanford Research
Institute. There they caused
extensive damage. When defeated
by government forces, they
retreated to Stanford to re-group
and re-organize for another move
and to send out forces to aid in
the fighting in Berkeley.
This has gone far beyond social
protest to the point of violent
insurrection against established
institutions and values.
It is a tragedy that so many
who are really concerned about
war-related research are being
used by radical leaders who want
to stop the research only as a step
toward their ultimate ends. The
real goal of the A3M leaders is
power and the destruction of
institutions which will ultimately
include Stanford University.
Excuse
The radicals used the excuse
that they are not armed, but they
do not need arms. They can take
away the freedom of people to
move and work and thus bring on
the confrontation they desire
without arms. And they are
prepared to meet and defeat

certain police tactics with their
own means.
The University is faced with a
situation in which it is
unintentionally harboring
revolutionaries who are organizing
into bands of terrorists to wreak
destruction not only on this
campus but on neighboring areas.
Two sets of actions could help
remedy this situation: (1) the
expulsion from Stanford
University of those identified with
the violence and disruption at SRI
Hanover and Encina Hall, and (2)
an injunction served on those
same people to prohibit their
presence on the Stanford campus.
N ill ilism
The radical leaders are at
Stanford primarily to foment riots
and revolution. They are
interested in an educationâ€”in
guerrilla tactics, mob psychology
and the philosophy of nihilism.
President Pitzer should be
reminded that he has lost the
respect of a great many Stanford
students for straddling the issue of
violence and coercion on and off
campus. In his attempt to remain
tolerant, he has appeared
wishy-washy.
Moderates and students on the
right do not respect President
Pitzer because of his token and
half-hearted efforts to restore
peace and justice to our campus
while actually encouraging the
nihilists through his sympathy
with many of their professed
goals. Leftists and radicals do not
respect Pitzer for his
identification with the
Establishment and permanent
institutions.
Act Now
President Pitzer must act now.
Radicals have announced their
intention to continue and, if
necessary, to escalate their tactics
of confrontation and guerrilla
war. Members of the Palo Alto
City Council are talking about
using machine-guns to counter
their advances.
The time has passed to appeal to
the revolutionaries through reason
and rational dialogue. They
simply are not interested.
Of the many issues in the crisis
at Stanford, the most important is
that of violent insurrection.
The University is not equipped
to wage counter-revolution. Its
only alternative is to deny the
rebel forces the use of the
facilities of Stanford University.
