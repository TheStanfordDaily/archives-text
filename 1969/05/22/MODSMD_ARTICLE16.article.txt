# Berkeley Letter
## University With Blood On Its Hands 
### 
Professor Leon Wofsy

Dear Chancellor Heynes:
The radio has just reported
Governor Reagan's praise of the
Berkeley Administration for its
prompt action on the "People's
Park." Because I have respected
you, despite differences, I feel
compelled to say not that you
have earned fully the Governor's
tribute.
Your statement announcing
the decision to build the fence
was cynical in content,
contemptuous in tone,
hard-boiled in its disregard for
consequences. Were its message
distilled to essential truths, it
could have been offered in one
sentence: the land must be
reclaimed before Reagan and the
Regents meet, by whatever means

necessary and regardless of cost.
Now, we know the cost: we
have arrived at the penultimate, if
not the ultimate, stage in violence,
when police fire into crowds
around and on the Berkeley
Campus. The University's
responsibility for this outcome
cannot be shunted off to others
nor blamed on circumstances: not
on confusion and suspicion over
motives surroundintg the park
issue, nor the atmosphere of
provocation and counter
provocation, nor the entirely
predictable rock-throwing attacks
on police. Perhaps you
underestimated the cost of
resorting to ultimatum and
massive police force as a
substitute for grappling with

problems that often seem
insuperable. Surely, you were not
informed that the police
authorities were prepared to order
wholesale use of shotguns and
even rifles.
But blaming it all on Reagan
would also make for a poor
excuse. No doubt, if you did not
meet the deadling of the Regents'
meeting, the Governor would have
demanded your head. Maybe you
would have been fired—then the
responsibility would have been
Reagan's. Had you chosen to
insist on time and patience for
creative approaches to deep,
complex, sometimes mystifying
problems, you appeal might have
gone unheeded by the Regents,
but your effort would have

contributed in some measure to
the process of public enlightment
required to rescue the universities
from pressures toward academic
and moral degeneration.
Disdain
As things stand, independent
of intentions, what the Berkeley
Administration decided makes its
responsibility inescapable. I know
the almost instinctive discomfort
and disdain which many
academics and liberals feel when
subjected to "radical rhetoric,"
whether about Vietnam, race or
the campus. But I am convinced
that what happened yesterday
leaves the University with blood
onits hands.
Our faculty has condemned

repeatedly, as we should, the
promotion of violence by anyone
as an answer to campus or
campus-related, issues. Hard as it
may be to acknowledge the fact,
the Berkeley Administration
deserves its full share of that
indictment. It is inconceivable
that we should accept the Reagan
and Hayakawa guidelines in
dealing with campus problems as
an unavoidable, if evil, necessity.
Do people really have to be
murdered before educators refuse
to be pressed into service as
gauleiters under the Governor's
ever ready armies of occupation?
