## Where Are The 1600 Now? 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Last month at the student
body meeting, some 1600 people
indicated that they would
participate in a sit-in or some
similar action if the Trustees did
not indicate by their May 13th
meeting that they were planning
to institute the reforms demanded
by the April 3rd Movement. After
the Trustees voted to sell SRI
without any controls, a couple
hundred people actually did
something. They went over to
SRI-Hanover Street branch and
blocked streets. Most of the rest
of the 1600 have done nothing.
Monday afternoon A3M
peacefully picketed the main
installation of SRI for a couple
hours. Maybe 500 people
participated. I was one of the
picketers. I thought picketing was
good. It may never force the
Trustees to change their minds
and it may not stop SRI from
being sold to a business firm, but
it will not alientate liberals and
moderates who support A3M's
goals. And it surely demonstrates
opposition to the Trustees'
decision and continued support
for A3M's demands.
But A3M people are not very
interested in continuing to picket
SRI because they believe they
can't get enough people to do an
effective job. They are afraid that
they will only get the couple
hundred radicals to picket. And so
they plan to do more disruptive
and less legal things on the
assumption that the fewer people
they have, the more extreme their
actions must be.
There's one sure way to keep
A3M from blocking streets and
getting arrested. The rest of the
1600 who said last month they
would be doing something in
response to the Trustees' decision
must show up at the next A3M
meeting and say that they are
willing to help peacefully picket
SRI. If A3M has 1600 or more
people willing to spend a few
hours a week picketing SRI, it will
not be engaging in mobile guerrilla
tactics.
Picketing isn't a whole lot of
fun. Walking back and forth in
front of SRI under a hot sun for a
few hours isn't the most enjoyable
thing one can think of doing,
especially when one has school
work which needs to be done. But
it's a whole lot more enjoyable
than seeing the community and
the country become polarized by
tactics of groups like A3M since
polarization will produce a strong
right which will try to repress
everyone working for constructive
change.
Where are you 1600 now?

•Laws
Editor, THE DAILY:
Although I realize that you
hold Engineers and other
"technicians" in low esteem I'm
beginning to wonder if the reason
isn't because we engineers are
reuired to abide by fixed physical
laws while groups with which you
periodically sympathize such as
A3M and SDS attempt to bend
laws to suite their posture at the
time and if they can't bend them
they just ignore them. Alas, if we
were as free with the laws
governing our "conduct" the
results would be disasterous:
H-bombs wouldn't explode and
ICBM's would stay on the pad,
but likewise T.V. sets wouldn't
work, heart pacemakers would
fail, and the "bullhorns" which
are so dear to the heart of the
radical organizer would be
unheard.
Unfortunately there are some
laws which are just as valid in
your "world" as ours and one of
these is the law of numbers. In
yesterday's lead article on the
A3M protest you attempted to
make the force of the
demonstrators as big as you could
and said in column 3 that there
were ''more than 250
demonstrators." Later on in the
same article you say that even this
large group was beaten down
because the "Police outnumbered
the Demonstrators."
Unfortunately two inches
below this statement you let slip
the fact that the total police force
was only 229. Come on, fellows,
you can't have it both ways.
Either the police force was
extremely effective in doing what
the public expects them to do
against a much greater force, or
else a lot fewer "demonstrators"
showed up than you cared to
admit.

•Czech Response
This letter was received in
response to a letter of support
sent to students in
Czechoslovakia, signed by over
400 Stanford students.
Prague, May 6, 1969
Dear friends:
We thank you very much for
the great support for our struggle
for a human socialist society you
expressed by your letter and
hundreds of your signatures.
Even that our struggle becomes
day by day more hopeless we still

believe that it is worthwhile not
to give up our ideals.
Thank you once again for your
words which pleased us so much
and helped us.
Cordially,
Students of Technical
University of Prague.

• Correction
Editor, THE DAILY:
I would like to take the
opportunity to correct the figures
which were quoted in the article
concerning the Martin Luther
King Fund in the May 9 Daily.
It was reported that the Martin
Luther King Fund would make
available $327,000 for direct aid
for Minority Students during
1969-70. In actuality, this figure
represents the gap between the
University's commitment of
$978,345 to the program and the
$651,345 in funds which is
available from the following
sources: $55 1,345 from
University unrestricted funds, and
$100,000 in government grants. It
is hoped that a sizeable portion of
the needed $327,000 will come
from gift sources, such as The
Martin Luther King Fund this
year. Many students, faculty and
staff are now involved in
volunteer efforts to obtain gift
support. As of April 30, slightly
more than $4 0,000 in
contributions to the Fund has
been received as a result of
Faculty and Staff contributions.
A drive among students is
currently in progress.

• ROTC
Editor, THE DAILY:
Uh, I have a comment to make,
and perhaps you'll see fit to print
this letter. I'm a linguist
Vietnamese type. I want to
comment on ROTC on Stanford

campus. For God's sake don't get
rid of it! I don't like this army
much as it is, but it would be
unbearable if all the officers were
West Point or OCS army trained. I
don't ever want an army that is all
professional and we might as well
face the fact we're going to have
an army. Hold on to ROTC for it
insures that a few liberal minded
non-professional, non-beggar
types will continue to infiltrate
the hardcore.
