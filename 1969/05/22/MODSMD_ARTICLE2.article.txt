# Warren Earl Burger
## Chief Justice Named 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP )-Presidcnt
Nixon reached into the federal judiciary
Wednesday night and chose Warren Earl
Burger, a relatively obscure federal
appeals court judge, to be 15th chief
justice of the United States.
The white-haired, 61-year-old
Minnesotan, who has sat for 13 years on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, told the President:
"You pay tribute to all of the sitting
judges of the federal system with this
nomination."
If the Senate confirms the
nomination after what may prove to be
the closest scrutiny ever given a
Supreme Court appointee, Burger will
succeed Earl Warren in the highest
judicial seat in the land.
Warren is retiring next month at age
78 after 16 turbulent years as chief

justice —and at a time when the court
itself has become a center of
controversy.
Appointment Overshadows Forlas
But the timing of the appointment of
a new chief justice —when Nixon could
have waited until summer to choose
Warren's successor—promised to
overshadow to some degree the tempest
created when Justice Abe Fortas
resigned last week under criticism for
his off-the-court financial dealings.
Fortas was nominated to the top
judicial post by former President
Lyndon B. Johnson last summer. Senate
Republicans led a fight to defeat the
nomination, however, citing his
continuing close ties to Johnson and his
acceptance of outside fees while sitting
on the court.
The Democratic majority in the

Senate will have this in mind—and all
senators will have the more recent
Fortas case in mind—when Burger's
nomination comes before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
Secret Choice Announced
Nixon's choice remained a secret
throughout Wednesday after the White
House announced the President had
reached a decision and would take to
nation-wide radio and television at 7
p.m. to make known his selection of a
jurist who has won a reputation as a
"law and order" judge on the appellate
court.
"I believe," the President said,
standing with Burger before a
microphone, "that the most important
nomination the President of the United
States makes during his term of office is
that of chief justice of the United
States.
"The chief justice is the guardian of
the Constitution of the United States.
Respect for law in a nation is the most
priceless asset a free people can have.
The chief justice and his associates are
the ultimate custodians and guardians of
that priceless asset.
"I have known him through 21
years," the President said of the former
assistant attorney general in the
Eisenhower administration.

controversy.
Appointment Overshadows Forlas
But the timing of the appointment of
a new chief justice —when Nixon could
have waited until summer to choose
Warren's successor—promised to
overshadow to some degree the tempest
created when Justice Abe Fortas
resigned last week under criticism for
his off-the-court financial dealings.
Fortas was nominated to the top
judicial post by former President
Lyndon B. Johnson last summer. Senate
Republicans led a fight to defeat the
nomination, however, citing his
continuing close ties to Johnson and his
acceptance of outside fees while sitting
on the court.
The Democratic majority in the

Senate will have this in mind—and all
senators will have the more recent
Fortas case in mind—when Burger's
nomination comes before the Senate
Judiciary Committee.
Secret Choice Announced
Nixon's choice remained a secret
throughout Wednesday after the White
House announced the President had
reached a decision and would take to
nation-wide radio and television at 7
p.m. to make known his selection of a
jurist who has won a reputation as a
"law and order" judge on the appellate
court.
"I believe," the President said,
standing with Burger before a
microphone, "that the most important
nomination the President of the United
States makes during his term of office is
that of chief justice of the United
States.
"The chief justice is the guardian of
the Constitution of the United States.
Respect for law in a nation is the most
priceless asset a free people can have.
The chief justice and his associates are
the ultimate custodians and guardians of
that priceless asset.
"I have known him through 21
years," the President said of the former
assistant attorney general in the
Eisenhower administration.
WASHINGTON (AP )-Presidcnt
Nixon reached into the federal judiciary
Wednesday night and chose Warren Earl
Burger, a relatively obscure federal
appeals court judge, to be 15th chief
justice of the United States.
The white-haired, 61-year-old
Minnesotan, who has sat for 13 years on
the U.S. Court of Appeals for the
District of Columbia, told the President:
"You pay tribute to all of the sitting
judges of the federal system with this
nomination."
If the Senate confirms the
nomination after what may prove to be
the closest scrutiny ever given a
Supreme Court appointee, Burger will
succeed Earl Warren in the highest
judicial seat in the land.
Warren is retiring next month at age
78 after 16 turbulent years as chief

justice —and at a time when the court
itself has become a center of
controversy.
