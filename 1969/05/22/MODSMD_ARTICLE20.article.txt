# Would You Believe?
## A 						Nervous D.C. 
### Art Buchwald 
There is no denying that
Washington has been rocked by
the Justice Abe Fortas
resignation. I noticed, as with
previous scandals in the nation's
Capital, that everyone gets very
nervous and defensive when a
story like this breaks.
I dropped in to see a senator
the other day, and he asked me to
sit down while he went over a
speech he was preparing with his
aide to be given to the American
Legion.
"I don't like this line here," he
said, "where I refer to the very
foundations of this nation."
"Why not?" the aide asked.
"The word 'foundations,' you
fool. I don't want people to think
that I support foundations in any
way."
"That's a good point, sir. I'll
strike it."
"Now down here in the fourth
paragraph you have me saying
'with liberty and justice for all."

"Yes, sir. That's a direct steal
from the Pledge of Allegiance."
"You'd better knock out
justice. I don't want the legion to
think I'm defending anyone on
the Supreme Court."
"That's a pretty far-fetched
interpretation of the word
'justice," the aide said.
"Don't argue," the senator
replied. "Politicians may soon be
hanged for less."
"OK, senator. I think you'll
like this paragraph I inserted
about stamping out revolts on
college campuses."
"Let me see it. Wait a minute.
You've got me saying that I
believe in lawful dissent, but not
illegal and revolutionary tactics."
"Yes, sir. What's wrong with
that?"
"Didn't Abe Fortas dissent in
several Supreme Court cases?"
"I believe he did, but . .
"Cut it. You don't seem to
realize how uptight this country is
right now. I also don't approve
this phrase about 'the great
decisions that face mankind."
''What's wrong with
mankind?"
"It isn't mankind, it's decisions
that I'm against. Who hands down
decisions?"
"The Supreme Court?"
"Exactly. And while you're at
it, take out all references to 'law
and order.' I know it's a popular
phrase, but for the moment I'd
just prefer to talk only about
'order' until the Fortas thing
blows over."
"I believe the speech is going
to be short, senator."
"Well, beef it up with some
thought on the Soviet missile
threat."
"You could lecture them on
the ABM," the aide said.
The senator flushed. "Why did
you have to use the word
'lecture'?"
"I just used it. 1 didn't mean
anything by it"
"You know what connotation
'lecture' has in this town now.
You haven't been going through
my files, have you?"
"No, sir. Believe me, it was just
a slip of the tongue, senator."
"All right, but watch yourself.
We've got to be very careful for a
while."
"I'm resigned to it, sir."
"Resigned?"
"Damn," said the aide. "I did
it again."

blows over."
"I believe the speech is going
to be short, senator."
"Well, beef it up with some
thought on the Soviet missile
threat."
"You could lecture them on
the ABM," the aide said.
The senator flushed. "Why did
you have to use the word
'lecture'?"
"I just used it. 1 didn't mean
anything by it"
"You know what connotation
'lecture' has in this town now.
You haven't been going through
my files, have you?"
"No, sir. Believe me, it was just
a slip of the tongue, senator."
"All right, but watch yourself.
We've got to be very careful for a
while."
"I'm resigned to it, sir."
"Resigned?"
"Damn," said the aide. "I did
it again."
There is no denying that
Washington has been rocked by
the Justice Abe Fortas
resignation. I noticed, as with
previous scandals in the nation's
Capital, that everyone gets very
nervous and defensive when a
story like this breaks.
I dropped in to see a senator
the other day, and he asked me to
sit down while he went over a
speech he was preparing with his
aide to be given to the American
Legion.
"I don't like this line here," he
said, "where I refer to the very
foundations of this nation."
"Why not?" the aide asked.
"The word 'foundations,' you
fool. I don't want people to think
that I support foundations in any
way."
"That's a good point, sir. I'll
strike it."
"Now down here in the fourth
paragraph you have me saying
'with liberty and justice for all."

"Yes, sir. That's a direct steal
from the Pledge of Allegiance."
"You'd better knock out
justice. I don't want the legion to
think I'm defending anyone on
the Supreme Court."
"That's a pretty far-fetched
interpretation of the word
'justice," the aide said.
"Don't argue," the senator
replied. "Politicians may soon be
hanged for less."
"OK, senator. I think you'll
like this paragraph I inserted
about stamping out revolts on
college campuses."
"Let me see it. Wait a minute.
You've got me saying that I
believe in lawful dissent, but not
illegal and revolutionary tactics."
"Yes, sir. What's wrong with
that?"
"Didn't Abe Fortas dissent in
several Supreme Court cases?"
"I believe he did, but . .
"Cut it. You don't seem to
realize how uptight this country is
right now. I also don't approve
this phrase about 'the great
decisions that face mankind."
''What's wrong with
mankind?"
"It isn't mankind, it's decisions
that I'm against. Who hands down
decisions?"
"The Supreme Court?"
"Exactly. And while you're at
it, take out all references to 'law
and order.' I know it's a popular
phrase, but for the moment I'd
just prefer to talk only about
'order' until the Fortas thing
blows over."
"I believe the speech is going
to be short, senator."

threat."
