# Civ Prof Outraged At Pitzer Response

### BILL EVERS 
Western Civ instructor Ronald
Hamowy reacted with "surprise
and annoyance" to President
Kenneth Pitzer's Tuesday
statement that the recent threat
by a group of Civ teachers to
withhold their grade sheets was
"outrageous."
The threat was made in
response to an injunction
obtained by the University after
the occupation of Encina Hall.
Under the terms of the injunction,
a suspended student might have
been found in contempt of court
if he attended Western Civ classes.
The Civ instructors said they were
defending their prerogative to
decide who could audit their
classes.
Professor Hamowy, assistant
director of the Western Civ

program, said he was especially
astonished by Pitzer's comment
that the threat came from "a
relative'y junior group of
faculty." "This was an attempt,"
said Hamowy, "to minimize the
importance of the issue," as well
as, "a gratuitous slur directed
against the Western Civ
instructors."
"President Pitzer should be
reminded that 'relatively junior
faculty' teach a sizeable
proportion of the courses at
American universities, especially if
one includes T.A.'s."
In addition, Hamowy found it
hard to understand why Pitzer
found the action of the Civ
instructors "outrageous," when he
did not find "the Trustees
overruling the student and faculty
referenda outrageous."
Hamowy went on to say that
he, in contrast to Pitzer, found
different things at Stanford
outrageous: "research which is
dedicated to the destruction of
life and human values" and"the
contrived way in which carte
blanche approval was gained at
the last Academic Council
meeting for future administration
actions."
Finally, Hamowy contended
that the Civ instructors' action is
of minor inportance compared
with "legalized murder on the
streets .of Berkeley during a
student demonstration."
