## Three Black Plays Set 
### CAROLYN HATCHETT 
The Stanford Black Drama
Group, produced by
Commissioner of Black Arts,
Johnnie Scott, and directed by
John Cochran, next year's Black
director-in-residence at Stanford,
enters its final week of planning
and rehearsing.
Many hours of hard work and a
few tears have gone into the
preparation for next week's
premiere (May 25, 26, 28, and 29
in Deinkelspiel Auditorium;
showtimes: 8:00 p.m.) of the
three Black plays, "The Electronic
Nigger," "Old Judge Mose is
Dead," and "A Son, Come
Home."
The members of the cast have
fought against numerous
difficulties, most important of
which were limited time and
theatrical experience on the part
of the cast. Its members range
from chemistry majors to students
of social psychology, from
freshmen to senior men and
women.
The Black Drama Group,
newly formed this quarter,
undertook a production which
includes not only drama as a
means of expression, but other art
forms such as music and dance as
well. The group has performed at
Palo Alto High School and will be
making appearances at
Ravenswood, College of San

Mateo, and other shcools in the
area in an attempt to carry their
message to as large an audience as
possible.
The members of the cast have
made a commitment — a
commitment to convey the Black
man's culture. The striving for
self-determination and cultural
consciousness that has been
sweeping through the Black
communities everywhere in
America has finally found its way
into the culturally deprived
Stanford community.
Black Art, as exemplified in
the above three plays, is an
attempt to confront the
contradictions that arise out of
the Black man's experience in the
Western World. In America, the
guidelines for the production of
any art have come from the white
society. Whites have defined,
produced and criticized art, using
a language which has served as a
powerful weapon to enslave the
rest of mankind.
Now, Black writers are
appearing who dare to condemn
that language and are using a
language of their own to re-define
themselves. As a result, we see the
emergence of a Black culture and
self-awareness, a very important
development in the lives of Black
people. For culture is the basis of
all ideas, images, and action.
Without a culture, Black people

are only a set of reactions to the
values held by the larger white
society.
In his aspirations for the
direction of the action on a Black
stage Leßoi Jones, a Black writer,
has said:
"We will scream and cry,
murder, run through the streets in
agony, if it means someone will be
moved to actual life
understanding of what the world
is, and what it ought to be."
The Black Drama Group at
Stanford has about 76 members.
They include students from the
campus and individuals from the
neighboring Black communities,
East Palo Alto and Menlo Park.
There are also whites carrying
acting parts. Together, the
members form a drama group
which is as representative as
possible of the Black Experience
in our society.
The Cultural Revolution has
come to Stanford. To miss the
premiere of the Stanford Black
Drama Group would be to miss an
opportunity to hear, see, and
experience the truth—a rare
commodity in our society.
Tickets are on sale now at the
Tresidder Box Office and box
offices throughout the Bay Area;
