# CBW Study
## 
### 
A group of concerned students
and faculty has set up a program
to keep alive the particular CBW
issue raised at the time of the
AEL sit-in.
The group, which calls itself
The Life Sciences Caucus, has
called for a series of work groups
and a study forum to be set up in
the Fall Quarter, 1969, to study
several sides of the question,
including the effect of chemical
and biological weapons, their
historical development, and steps
which the community could take
to control any further research.
The Life Science Caucus is
concerned that the guidelines for
research which were set down at
the time of the first sit-in are not
being implemented; and they
stress that even if these guidelines
are in fact implemented, the net
effect might amount to nothing if
they are applied only at Stanford
or SRI.
The proposed study program
for next fall would be extended
into the winter quarter; and the
work groups will ideally operate
in the framework of
student-directed courses, such as
Biology 199, Special Projects, and
similar courses in other
departments.
During the Winter Forum the
Caucus intends to invite a number
of experts in several fields to
speak on all sides of the problem.
The Caucus invites any
members of the community
interested in planning and
organizing the fall program to
attend its meeting tonight, in the
Biology Department laboratory
annex, in the fourth floor coffee
room. Persons interested in the
non-biological aspects of war
research are also urged to attend.
A large part of the study
program will deal with public
attitudes toward CBW, the
economics of such war research,
the policies and history of CBW
research, and future responses by
the community to bring research
under control.
