In order to assist students and advisers in planning class schedules
during the Autumn Quarter pre-registration period, the Office of
General Studies wishes to remind them that, to date, no official changes
have been made in the current General Studies requirements.
Though it may be likely that recent Senate actions affecting
all-University requirements for undergraduates will become effective
sometime during the coming year, these actions are not presently
effective and it is impossible at this time to say with any certainty
when, and for whom, they will become effective. Students who plan to
graduate during the next academic year are advised to plan their
schedules as though they will be held for the current General Studies
requirements. Those who elect to proceed otherwise, do so at their own
risk.
(NOTE: Students should be alert to the fact that the Senior
Colloquium requirement may be abandoned as of September 1, 1969.
This recommendation will be considered by the Senate at its meeting
on Thursday, May 22nd, and students should check the Daily for news
of the Senate's action.)
