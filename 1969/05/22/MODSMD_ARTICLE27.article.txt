## Ingenious Farce 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
A pleasant enough evening of
theatre may be found in the Little
Theater through Saturday night in
Ham's Head's production of Lock
IJp Your Daugh Icr.s. Director
Robin Lake, whose staging of the
play shows a fine sense of comic
ingenuity, has created a highly
entertaining farce which never
sinks into schmaltz by pretending
to be what it is not.
That is a common pitfall of
musical comedies—the aspiration
to be "real" theatre, to "mean"
something; and it can prove
disastrous and embarrassing to an
otherwise entertaining show. Mr.
Lake must be commended not
only for avoiding this
commonplace through a
knowledge of his medium's
limitations, but for working fully
and inventively within those
limitations. His production has no
pretensions to anything but
entertainment, and on that issue,
it fills the bill well.
The show, by Laurie Johnson
and Lionel Bart, is an adaptation
of Henry Fielding's "Rape Upon
Rape," with a light-hearted trifle
of a plot filled out by comic
characters, music and a delightful
epilogue. The show would be
nothing without the elements of
farce and characterization that
director and actors add, and in
this case they have virtually
created the show out of nothing.
Farcical Touch
The farcical touch pervades the
play from the opening music —a
delightful parody of several
musical styles —to the finale,
where the comic duo (Justice and
Mrs. Squeezum) sing the theme
song of the romantic leads.
But the entertainment of the
show lies even more heavily with
the comic characters, farcical
exaggerations of types of
Fielding's time and ours. Dick
Walker as Politik, a coffee-house
politician who reads all the papers
every day, and Roger Oliver as his
friend Dabble, are delightful
throughout, and hilarious in their
song-and-dance, "It Must Be True
(For I read it in the papers, didn't
you?)."
Jeff Garwin as Quill, Justice

Squeezum's clerk, has some
wonderful moments of
pantomime; he opens the second
act of the play with a very funny
parody of one of Squeezum's
scenes in the first act.
Tlie Comic Face
As Squeezum, Jim Kason is
also very funny, and very much of
a rascal. Robert McClaren as
Ramble, a rake, shares also in the
quality which distinguishes all of
these actors: a marvelous sense of
the comic farce. In a small
theatre, one can rely on subleties
of facial expression to create a
comic role, although sometimes it
seemed to me that the actors were
relying too heavily on this
method.
In any case, Sue Bales as Mrs.
Squeezum (possibly Garwin also)
stands out from the others
because she does not rely solely
on her face. She uses facial
expression as much as anyone; but
she also has command of a great
variety in voice and movement to
create a more complete character.
And she steals the show. Her two
songs, "When Does the Ravishing
Begin" and "I'll Be There," are
the high points of the two acts.
As the romantic leads, Pieter
Van Niel and Kit Haight do well;
their singing is beautiful, and Miss
Haight can hold the stage quite
well even when surrounded by
striking comic characters. And
when the company as a whole gets
into the act, the scenes come to
boisterous life under Mr. Lake's
staging; one wishes there had been
more such numbers.
A Little Slow
There is some unevenness in
the show; some parts, especially in
the middle of the second act,
move slowly, due to uncertain
pacing and inadequacy on the part
of some of the characters
(Sotmore, Brazencourt). In
addition, some of the songs are
barely audible above the
orchestra, and it requires some
concentration to hear the words.
Nevertheless, the show does
turn out to be exactly what it was
intended to be: an entertaining,
farcical theatrical evening. If you
want to relax and laugh, go see it.
