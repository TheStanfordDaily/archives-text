The Palo Alto International
soccer tournament opened last
Sunday with a game in Stanford
S Stadium which saw West
Bromwich Albion of England
defeat Dukla Prague of
Czechoslovakia 2-1 before a
crowd of some 5,500 fans.
In spite of occasionally sloppy
ball handling and passing on the
part of both teams, the game was
an exciting one with numerous
well-executed plays and fine
shots.
West Brom. opened the scoring
eafly in the first half when a low
cross from the right wing was
deflected in by an advancing
forward. The Czechs retaliated a
bit later with a straightforward
shot from the edge of the penalty
area which caught the screened
British goalkeeper off-guard. The
second English score came on a
perfectly-timed reverse head shot
that just topped the Prague
goalie's outstretched hands.
The British dominated the first
half by aggressive midfield play
and several fast breaks. However,
the Czechs seemed to have paced
themselves better since they came
back with a strong showing in the
second half. It was only by virtue
of several fine saves by the British
goalie and excellent defensive
work by their halfbacks that

further Prague scoring was
prevented.
Next Sunday's douljleheader
pits winners against winners as
Setubal of Portugal (victors over
the Clippers 2-0 in Fresno) goes
