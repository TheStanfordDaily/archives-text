# Two-Week Drive: 1500 Oppose ABM
## 
### 
The Stanford Community
Against the ABM (SCAABM)
announced today that it had
collected over 1500 signatures on
a petition urging Congress to vote
"no" on the proposed Safeguard
ABM system.
According to Cynthia
Cannady, chairman of the two
week old petition drive, the
petitions will be sent to
Congressman Allard Lowenstein
of New York and Senator J.
William Fulbright of Arkansas.

SCAABM has also mailed close to
two hundred postcards and letters
from faculty and students to
several Senators and Congressmen.
The group has a table in White
Plaza which furnishes postcards,
addresses, information, bumper
stickers, and buttons.
Tonight the organization will
be meeting at 8 in the ASSU
office to discuss carrying the
letter-writing campaign to the
dorms.
