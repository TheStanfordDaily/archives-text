# Apollo In Lunar Orbit; Moon 'Probe' Readied
## 
### 
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)—Apollo 10 astronauts rocketed
Wednesday into a perilous 2'/2-day orbit
of the moon.
They saw the lunar surface as a place
of strange lights and volcanoes but
easily found landmarks other space men
will use to land there in July.
"The color looks like a brownish
gray to us," radioed Navy Cmdr. John
W. Young minutes after Apollo 10

reappeared from its first pass behind the
moon.
"We can pick out a couple of good
little volcanoes," said Air Force Co.
Thomas P. Stafford.
As the spacecraft passed into the
lunar night, Navy. Cmdr. Eugene A.
Cernan said it was orbiting "right down
the Apollo trench"—the term for a
series of landmarks leading up to the
landing zone picked for the moon
touchdown in July.
Young said that colors on the back
side of the moon are different from
those on the side perpetually turned
toward earth.
Approach Moon Today
Stafford and Cernan will fly the
separate lunar module —a flimsy craft
designed to land on the moon—to
within 9.3 miles above the moon on
Thursday. Their flight will survey the
site for a planned moon landing in July.
The Apollo 10 crew rocketed into
lunar orbit shortly after the spacecraft
passed around the back of the moon at
the time they were out of radio contact
with the earth.
Apollo 10 was out of touch with
earth for 34 minutes—during which the
rocket firing was performed—and
ground controllers waited tensely for
the first word from space.
It came from Stafford.
"You can tell the world," he said,
"we have arrived."
Seeing is Believing
"You have to see this planet to
believe it," were Young's first words.
Cernan noted: "The first view I had
of the moon was reflected in the
overhead window of the lunar lander
attached to the command module."
Just before Apollo 10 passed out of
contact with the earth, ground
controllers passed up a final word.
"It's two minutes to loss of signal,"
said capsule communicator Charles
Duke, "and everybody here says
'Godspeed."
