# LASSU To Meet
## 
### 
The student legislature (LASSU) will
meet this evening in room 370 to begin
consideration of next year's ASSU
budget.
Because immediate determination of
the budget is crucial, other LASSU
meetings are scheduled for next
Monday, Wednesday, and, if necessary,
next Thursday.
Other issues on tonight's agenda
include a loan to the Photography Club
and the addition of three clubs to the
ASSU by-laws: the Population and
Environment Forum, the Psychology
Club, and MECHA, a Mexican student
organization.
Placing these clubs in the By-Laws
would make them eligible to receive
ASSU funds.
Due to disagreements over the
agenda and other conflicts, several
LASSU members left last week's
meeting and eliminated the quorum.
Speaker Yale Braunstein encouraged
all LASSU members to remain in
tonight's meeting: "The budget has to
be considered. Even though members
have a right to leave, I feel that they
have a responsibility to stay and do
important things like consider the
budget."
