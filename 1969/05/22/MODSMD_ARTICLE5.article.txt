# Gun Incident

### 
A report in yesterday's San Francisco
Chronicle that a Stanford student was
pistol-whipped on Monday when a
barricade was erected near SRI is
apparently incorrect.
According to Doron Weinberg, a
member of the legal aid committee of
the April 3rd Movement, and Mark
Bostwick, a graduate student, who both
witnessed the incident, a motorist did
brandish a weapon"at a student, but the
student was not actually struck by the
pistol.
The incident took place at the
intersection of. Page Mill Road and El
Camino Real when a group of"
demonstrators placed three barricades
across Page Mill and started to walk
away. •'
A motorist jumped out of his car and
brandished a pistol at the student. The
student, who did not wish to be
idenitified at this time, fell back in
surprise.
The witness, James Dawson, who
indicated that the student had been
pistol whipped, evidently saw the
student jump back from the pistol and
from his angle of vision thought that the
student had been hit, according to
Doron Weinberg.
The car the motorist was driving was
identified and, according to the
Chronicle is registered to Garry Esget of
735 North Claremont Street, San
Mateo. Esget is reportedly a policeman
and was off duty at the time the
incident occurred. He denies the
incident.
The waving of the pistol can be
considered assault with a deadly
weapon, and the student involved will
probably prosecute, according to
Weinberu.
