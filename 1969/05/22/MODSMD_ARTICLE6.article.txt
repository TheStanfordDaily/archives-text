# SJC Calls Sit-in Policy Violation
## 
### 
In a 6-1 vote, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) yesterday held that the
occupation of Encina Hall May 1
violated the University's policy on
campus disruption.
By a 5-2 majority, it decided not to
lift the temporary suspensions which
will remain in effect for 60 students
allegedly involved in the occupation
until they schedule a hearing with the
Council.
To date, temporary suspensions have
been lifted for 18 students who have
scheduled for completed hearings on
their case with the Council.
The SJC said it would continue to
schedule as many individual cases as it
can handle through May 31. It set May
29 for a special group hearing "devoted
solely to questions of motivation for
and justification of the actions of
defendants and the appropriateness of
academic penalties in the case."

According to the SJC, "any person
may join in such a group hearing by
signing a detailed agreement in Room
16211 of the Stanford Law School by 5
p.m. Wednesday May 28."
The hearing will cover only those
defendants "willing to admit that they
knowingly and willfully remained in
Encina . . .past a deadline for leaving the
building . .
Early Cases
To date, the Council has found one
person innocent, three guilty without
penalty, and four guilty with
punishment of probation until
graduation, a presidential reprimand,
and fines of $50 or $75.
None of these cases involved students
charged or convicted of a similar
offense. They involved students with
only "minimal" involvement, who
cooperated fully with the Council.
In setting any penalties following the
group hearing Thursday, the Council
said it would consider the following for
each individual: 1) prior convictions by
the Council; 2) specific acts with which
individuals are charged and for which
they are convicted, following individual
hearings; and 3) information
volunteered to the Council by
individuals concerning any matter
relevant to their individual penalty.
One Dissent
The Council includes four students
and four faculty members, with a
chairman who votes only to break ties.
Four faculty and two students joined in
the majority opinion, with one student
dissent. One student member did not
participate. (See majority and dissenting
statements below).
Two students, including one from
the majority, felt the temporary
suspensions should be lifted except for
those accused of specifically disrupting
a university photographer and journalist
who tried to take pictures and use their
office, respectively.
In his dissenting opinion, Richard J.
Lee said that since the only functions
reported disrupted at its hearing on the
incident were those of the
photographer, "the Council stretches
the policy to find without qualification
that . . .a disruption occurred."

can handle through May 31. It set May
29 for a special group hearing "devoted
solely to questions of motivation for
and justification of the actions of
defendants and the appropriateness of
academic penalties in the case."

According to the SJC, "any person
may join in such a group hearing by
signing a detailed agreement in Room
16211 of the Stanford Law School by 5
p.m. Wednesday May 28."
The hearing will cover only those
defendants "willing to admit that they
knowingly and willfully remained in
Encina . . .past a deadline for leaving the
building . .
Early Cases
To date, the Council has found one
person innocent, three guilty without
penalty, and four guilty with
punishment of probation until
graduation, a presidential reprimand,
and fines of $50 or $75.
None of these cases involved students
charged or convicted of a similar
offense. They involved students with
only "minimal" involvement, who
cooperated fully with the Council.
In setting any penalties following the
group hearing Thursday, the Council
said it would consider the following for
each individual: 1) prior convictions by
the Council; 2) specific acts with which
individuals are charged and for which
they are convicted, following individual
hearings; and 3) information
volunteered to the Council by
individuals concerning any matter
relevant to their individual penalty.
One Dissent
The Council includes four students
and four faculty members, with a
chairman who votes only to break ties.
Four faculty and two students joined in
the majority opinion, with one student
dissent. One student member did not
participate. (See majority and dissenting
statements below).
Two students, including one from
the majority, felt the temporary
suspensions should be lifted except for
those accused of specifically disrupting
a university photographer and journalist
who tried to take pictures and use their
office, respectively.
In his dissenting opinion, Richard J.
Lee said that since the only functions
reported disrupted at its hearing on the
incident were those of the
photographer, "the Council stretches
the policy to find without qualification
that . . .a disruption occurred."

In a 6-1 vote, the Stanford Judicial
Council (SJC) yesterday held that the
occupation of Encina Hall May 1
violated the University's policy on
campus disruption.
By a 5-2 majority, it decided not to
lift the temporary suspensions which
will remain in effect for 60 students
allegedly involved in the occupation
until they schedule a hearing with the
Council.
To date, temporary suspensions have
been lifted for 18 students who have
scheduled for completed hearings on
their case with the Council.
The SJC said it would continue to
schedule as many individual cases as it
can handle through May 31. It set May
29 for a special group hearing "devoted
solely to questions of motivation for
and justification of the actions of
defendants and the appropriateness of
