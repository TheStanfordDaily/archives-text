Proceedings
On May 1, 1969, in the early
morning hours, a series of events at
Encina Hall resulted in the temporary
suspension by the University President
of more than seventy students. On
Wednesday, May 14, 1969, the Stanford
Judicial Council announced that it
would hold a hearing to determine if the
events at Encina had resulted in a
disruption within the meaning of the
University Policy on Campus
Disruption. All persons under
temporary suspension were invited to
participate. The hearing was held on

Monday, May 19, 1969. Six students
took part and agreed to be bound by
the decision.
Findings of Fact
The Council finds the following facts
to have occurred at Encina Hall on May
1, 1969:
1. A number of unauthorized
persons broke in to and occupied the
building at approximately 12:45 a.m.
2. A University photographer, whose
duty it was to take news photographs,
did not do so due to intimidation by
persons occupying the building.
3. A member of the University News
and Publication staff was unable to use
his office in the ordinary course of his
business because it was occupied by
unauthorized persons and he was
intimidated by hostile acts of persons
occupying the building.
4. The files of a member of the
News and Publication staff were
displaced. She was required
subsequently to spend considerable time
to reorder the files. In addition, other
files and drawers in the building were
rifled and disturbed by the persons
occupying the building.
5. A number of assorted acts of
vandalism were committed by the
persons occupying the buildings. These
included the breaking of glass panels in
exterior and interior doors, the cutting
of a lock, and breaking of windows.
6. Pursuant to emergency measures
adopted on April 18, 1969 by the
University President, the Dean of
Students, acting on behalf of the
Provost, entered Encina Hall to
determine if a disruption had occurred.
The Dean reported to the Provost who,
acting in the absence of the University
President, and in accordance with the
emergency measures, ordered Encina
Hall to be closed. Persons inside Encina
Hall wet? given warning to leave within
i ft... n linutes. A sizeable number of
persons efused to leave.
Conclusions of Law
The Council finds that as a result of
the events which occurred in the early
morning hours of May 1, 1969, in
Encina Hall, the University Policy on
Campus Disruption was violated.
Holding
The Council recommends that the
President inform the defendants as
follows:
1. The temporary suspensions shall
not now be lifted, except as noted in 3
below.
2. Individuals may request hearings
on their individual cases. Such hearings
will be scheduled during the current
quarter insofar as the time of the
Council will allow. The Council is
dedicated to setting for hearing as many
cases as it can hear up until and through
May 31, 1969.
3. As to any person who has a

hearing set for a time certain, the
Council will recommend that his
temporary suspension be lifted.
4. Defendants should be aware that
the following acts may, but not
necessarily will be held to constitute
violations of the University Policy on
Campus Disruption:
a. specific acts preventing or
hindering persons from carrying out
their regular University duties
b. Presence in Encina Hall as a
member of a group at a time when
members of the group were engaged
in committing acts preventing or
hindering persons from carrying out
their regular University duties
c. Presence in Encina Hall
subsequent to notification that the
building was declared closed.
Mr. Holdorf concurs in the above
opinion except as to recommendation
number 1, regarding the lifting of
temporary suspensions, and in that case
he concurs in the dissenting opinion.

Miss Carol Roesch was unable to be
present during the entire hearing. The
defendants agreed that the hearing
continue without her presence,
specifically requesting that she not
participate in the decision and waived
the quorum requirements occasioned by
her non-participation.
Dissent
I concur in the facts in this case,
but feel the decision must be amplified
in order to be a responsible decision,
and disagree with the holding.
Decision
The Policy on Campus Disruption
was violated on May 1 in Encina Hall in
that:
1. an official university
photographer was approached on the
first floor of Encina by an individual or
individuals in the early hours of May 1
and told not to take pictures. This
action "prevented .. . the effective
carrying out of a university .. . ap
proved activity."
2. a journalist on the university staff
went to his office in Encina during the
early hours of May 1 with the idea that
he would use it to carry out part of his
legitimate, normal work as an employee
of the university. Upon reaching his
office, he stuck his head in the
doorway, saw four people in his office,
felt intimidated by their presence, and,
feeling that "neither the time nor place"
was right for him to use his office, left
without further attempt to conduct his
business.
The Policy on Campus Disruptions
does not cover any of the following acts
in and of themselves:
