## UC Professors Confront Reagan 
### 
SACRAMENTO (AP) â€”Gov. Reagan
angrily banged his hand on the d.esk
Wednesday in a shouting debate with a
group of University of California
professors over their request thai
National Guard troops be removed from
the Berkeley campus.
"You're a liar," Reagan told Prof.
Leon Wofsy, who said chancellors of the
nine UC campuses fear Reagan's
political retaliation.
"Don't you charge me with going to
fire chancellors," Reagan said after
interrupting Wofsy's statement by
banging the palm of his hand on the
desk.
Prof. Owen Chamberlain, a Nobel
Prize-winning physicist, led the group,
saying, "We've conic to protest the use

of National Guard and outside police
force at Berkeley. We feel they're
leading to a real catastrophe . . ."
Reagan Challenges
But Reagan asked, "When did any of
you > appear before students" to ask
them to avoid violence.
"Over and over again . . .we've all
called for nonviolence," Wofsy replied.
Earlier Chamberlain appeared at a
news conference with seven other UC
professors, two doctors who treated
injured demonstrators and one medic.
Faculty Won't Teach
Chamberlain said 177 Berkeley
faculty members had a petition
declaring their "unwillingness to teach"
at Berkeley until police and troops are
removed.

Violence erupted at Berkeley last
Thursday when the University
administration moved in to clear an
impromptu park created by students
and nonstudents on UC land.
Wednesday's meeting under the glare
of lights in Reagan's outer office was
the governor's first prolonged
confrontation with UC faculty members
since a demonstration at the Capitol
more than two years ago.
Governor Admits "Mistake"
The governor conceded that use of a
helicopter spraying tear gas to clear
crowds from the Berkeley central
campus Thursday may have been "a
tactical mistake."
But "once the dogs of war are
unleashed, you must expect things will
happen, and people being human will
make mistakes on both sides."
