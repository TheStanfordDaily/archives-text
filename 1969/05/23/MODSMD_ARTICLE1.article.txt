The Stanford Research Institute has
done extensive work on the technique
of aerial spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard helicopter to
disperse a crowd at Berkeley on
Tuesday.
An investigation revealed yesterday
that a large, secret SRI contract from
the Army's chemical-biological warfare
center at Edgewood, Maryland, involved
research and experimentation in aerosol
generation of CS and other
incapacitating agents.
CS, also known as "super" or
"military" tear gas, blanketed the
University of California campus and
surrounding areas when the helicopter
used 50 lbs of CS dust to break up a
crowd in Sproul Hall plaza.
According to press reports, many
gassed students fell to the ground
screaming and vomiting. The gas seeped
into homes, offices, classrooms, and the
campus hospital, which had to take
emergency measures to protect patients
with respiratory ailments.
Gas Attack Condemned
UC faculty and the mayor of
Berkeley have condemned the gas
attack. Gov. Ronald Reagan has
admitted it may have been "a tactical
mistake."
Col. Andrew Wolf, public
information officer for the National
Guard in Berkeley, described the
helicopter's equipment as "an aerosol
type of arrangement that releases dust
from a tank under high pressure. It has

been experimented with and i sed
beiore." He would give no further
details.
CS tear gas from helicopters and
airplanes has been used regularly by
U.S. troops in Vietnam to flush out
guerillas.
SRI has been doing CBW work for
the Edgewood Arsenal since the early
1950'5. CS, technically known as
chiorobenzalmalonoitrils, was invented
by the British about that time.
C'S Use Explained
The San Francisco Chronicle
yesterday quoted an Army chemical
specialist as saying that CS "hydrolizes
on contact to an acid agent which
affects mucus membranes." Besides
tears, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea,
and to some persons, sunburn-like
blistering of the skin, said the specialist.
One large CBW contract at SRI in
recent years was "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents,'' Army contract
D A-l 8-035-AMC-122(A). William C.
Thuman, SRl's administrator for this
classified project, says it ran from
1964-67, cost $2.5 billion, and
employed "dozens" of scientisis.
"We did basic studies of all feasible
methods of dissemination" of several
chemical agents, Thuman told a Daily
reporter yesterday, "including
aerosolization and dispersion of CS."
Field testing of CS dispersion was done
at SRl's Calaveras test site, said
Thuman.
One report coming out of the same
contract in 1967 was "Dissemination of

Aerosol Particles by Forming Clouds."
An SRI technical report from
Thuman's contract in 1966, made
available to the Daily yesterday by
sources outside SRI, included these
excerpts:
"The objective of this research
program is to provide fundamental
information necessary for overall
improvement of dissemination
techniques applicable to chemical
munitions. Every effort is being made to
coordinate the program at Stanford
Research Institute with the
requirements of Edgewood Arsenal so
that information derived from this
program can be utilized most effectively
by the U.S. Army . . .
The report goes on to say that one of
the goals is experimentation with
"aeroparticulate material to produce an
effective cloud of the desired agent."
A later excerpt states, "Work with
CS pyrotechniques has been temporarily
curtailed. It has proved impractical to
handle CS in buildings and laboratories
shared with other projects due to the
low tolerance level of several workers on
the other projects. It was, therefore,
necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the
process of being transferred . . .
Edgewood Arsenal, the sponsor of
i!Rl's work, is the Defense Department's
research & development center for all
CBW. It supplies the Army and National
Guard.
SRl's work for Edgewood has
involved many other biological and

chemical agents besides C»J. jeymour
Hirsch, in his book Che.<>i?al and
Biological Warfare, identifies SUI as the
developer of nozzles for the aerial
dissemination of nerve gas. A
malfunction of such a nozzle caused the
death of 6,000 sheep near the Dugway
proving ground in Nevada in 1968. On
Wednesday, the Army admitted for the
first time to a House subcommittee that
the nerve gas killed the sheep, due to a
nozzle malfunction.
Aerosol dispersion of nerve gas and
CS is a difficult task.
William Perkins, a former Stanford
chemist now with Metronics Associates,
described the dissemination of CS
powder as "a very tough problem.'
Since CS is a dust, Perkins said, "you
have to avoid caking up. Particle size
distribution, electrostatic charge, and
reactivity all have to be taken into
account."
Sources at SRI said one key step in
the manufacture of CS was surface
treatment to control its reactivity with
water.
Besides high pressure dissemination,
SRI has studied extensively the use of
explosive techniques to spread CS tear
gas. Hand gernades and bombs are used
by the Army in Vietnam for this
purpose.
SRI is now working in Building 1 of
the Ravenswood complex on a project
entitled "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic Powders,"
meaning a form of CS that will resist
moisture until it comes in contact with
human mucus membranes. According to
an SRI researcher, who did not wish to
be identified, this project is specifically
intended to develop means for the
Army to spread CS over swamps and
other wet areas +n^Vietnam.
The Trustees announced May 13 that
SRI will accept no new CBW contracts.
The current chemical warfare project
should therefore be the last.
SRl's current chemical warfare
project has been described by Stanford
officials and others as an insignificant
contract without any particular military
applications.

GAS ATTACK—A National Guard helicoptcr sprays CS gas on demonstrators at Berkeley
Tuesday. SRI researched the principles of aerosol dissemination involved.
President Kenneth Pitzer told a
Dinkelspiel audience April 9 that
the contract, "which will end in
three months, is 'a study of the
behavior of non-toxic solids and
compressed hydrophobic
powders ... to learn how to
control particle size distribution
of aerosols of powders produced
by explosive dissemination."
Pitzer also said the project was
"unclassified." But SRI sources
said yesterday that all technical
reports from CBW projects are
subjected to strict controls on
distribution by the Defense
Department.

Pitzer Questioned
Pitzer was asked by the Daily
last night if he had been aware of
military applications of the
contract when he described it
publicly. He declined to comment
until he could review certain
information.
Another SRI research effort
with applications in CBW is
microencapsulation. A 1968
report title issued by SRI was
"Encapsulation of Small Particles
(1-10 microns in Diameter)."
According to an SRI researcher,
encapsulation is sometimes used
on CS "in order to make it longer
lasting, so that it does not react
until it gets into people's lungs."
SRI has been reducing its
contracts from the Edgewood
CBW Arsenal since 1967. In 1968
SRI had only $404,000 in CBW,
and only $50,000 in 1969.
William Thuman, the SRI
project administrator for the
1964-67 CBW contract, says he
can "live with" the decision to
end CBW.
Physicist's Remarks
At a panel discussion in
Memorial Auditorium in
February, an SRI physicist said he
had been "coerced" into working
on a project involving tear gas
dissemination. The reseracher had
stood up to contradict a
statement by SRI President
Charles Anderson that all SRI
researchers freely choose their
areas of inquiry.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement had some critical
comments yesterday on SRl's tear
gas research. "The fact that SRI
worked on the dispersion
techniques for the tear gas used at
Berkeley is very significant," said
Fred Cohen. "Of primary
importance is that while the
technique was first intended for

use against foreign insurgents, it
will also be used against domestic
groups which threaten the status
quo."
A3M member Leonard Siegel
said, "Now we know what
counterinsurgency really means.
I've always viewed it as an
abstraction, because it was only
used overseas. But when my sister
got gassed in her house in
Berkeley, then I understood
inside.
"Many might react by saying
SRI just doesn't care what its
research is used for," said Siegel.
"In fact, we have reason to believe
that SRI has developed scenarios
for when and how to use various
weapons in urban areas."
Basic A3M Demands
The April 3rd Movement's
basic demands are for an end to
c hemical-biological, secret,
counterinsurgency, and other
Vietnam war-related research at
SRI and Stanford. The Movement
also demanded that SRI be.
retained by the University to
ensure that these forms of
research were replaced by socially
constructive work.
The Trustees did not actually
order the cessation of CBW
research by themselves. On April
8, delegations from the faculty v»
and student body strongly urged**,
them to eliminate all such
immediately, and President Pitzor{*
urged some action on the A3Mr
demands. The Trustees
by requesting SRI to delay.,
accepting new CBW contracts. , jjv
In a referendum later in April,4
more than three-quarters
faculty and students disapproved
of CBW at SRI. On May 13, thej;

to refuse more CBW work.

affects mucus membranes." Besides
tears, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea,
and to some persons, sunburn-like
blistering of the skin, said the specialist.
One large CBW contract at SRI in
recent years was "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents,'' Army contract
D A-l 8-035-AMC-122(A). William C.
Thuman, SRl's administrator for this
classified project, says it ran from
1964-67, cost $2.5 billion, and
employed "dozens" of scientisis.
"We did basic studies of all feasible
methods of dissemination" of several
chemical agents, Thuman told a Daily
reporter yesterday, "including
aerosolization and dispersion of CS."
Field testing of CS dispersion was done
at SRl's Calaveras test site, said
Thuman.
One report coming out of the same
contract in 1967 was "Dissemination of

Aerosol Particles by Forming Clouds."
An SRI technical report from
Thuman's contract in 1966, made
available to the Daily yesterday by
sources outside SRI, included these
excerpts:
"The objective of this research
program is to provide fundamental
information necessary for overall
improvement of dissemination
techniques applicable to chemical
munitions. Every effort is being made to
coordinate the program at Stanford
Research Institute with the
requirements of Edgewood Arsenal so
that information derived from this
program can be utilized most effectively
by the U.S. Army . . .
The report goes on to say that one of
the goals is experimentation with
"aeroparticulate material to produce an
effective cloud of the desired agent."
A later excerpt states, "Work with
CS pyrotechniques has been temporarily
curtailed. It has proved impractical to
handle CS in buildings and laboratories
shared with other projects due to the
low tolerance level of several workers on
the other projects. It was, therefore,
necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the
process of being transferred . . .
Edgewood Arsenal, the sponsor of
i!Rl's work, is the Defense Department's
research & development center for all
CBW. It supplies the Army and National
Guard.
SRl's work for Edgewood has
involved many other biological and

chemical agents besides C»J. jeymour
Hirsch, in his book Che.<>i?al and
Biological Warfare, identifies SUI as the
developer of nozzles for the aerial
dissemination of nerve gas. A
malfunction of such a nozzle caused the
death of 6,000 sheep near the Dugway
proving ground in Nevada in 1968. On
Wednesday, the Army admitted for the
first time to a House subcommittee that
the nerve gas killed the sheep, due to a
nozzle malfunction.
Aerosol dispersion of nerve gas and
CS is a difficult task.
William Perkins, a former Stanford
chemist now with Metronics Associates,
described the dissemination of CS
powder as "a very tough problem.'
Since CS is a dust, Perkins said, "you
have to avoid caking up. Particle size
distribution, electrostatic charge, and
reactivity all have to be taken into
account."
Sources at SRI said one key step in
the manufacture of CS was surface
treatment to control its reactivity with
water.
Besides high pressure dissemination,
SRI has studied extensively the use of
explosive techniques to spread CS tear
gas. Hand gernades and bombs are used
by the Army in Vietnam for this
purpose.
SRI is now working in Building 1 of
the Ravenswood complex on a project
entitled "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic Powders,"
meaning a form of CS that will resist
moisture until it comes in contact with
human mucus membranes. According to
an SRI researcher, who did not wish to
be identified, this project is specifically
intended to develop means for the
Army to spread CS over swamps and
other wet areas +n^Vietnam.
The Trustees announced May 13 that
SRI will accept no new CBW contracts.
The current chemical warfare project
should therefore be the last.
SRl's current chemical warfare
project has been described by Stanford
officials and others as an insignificant
contract without any particular military
applications.

GAS ATTACK—A National Guard helicoptcr sprays CS gas on demonstrators at Berkeley
Tuesday. SRI researched the principles of aerosol dissemination involved.
President Kenneth Pitzer told a
Dinkelspiel audience April 9 that
the contract, "which will end in
three months, is 'a study of the
behavior of non-toxic solids and
compressed hydrophobic
powders ... to learn how to
control particle size distribution
of aerosols of powders produced
by explosive dissemination."
Pitzer also said the project was
"unclassified." But SRI sources
said yesterday that all technical
reports from CBW projects are
subjected to strict controls on
distribution by the Defense
Department.

Pitzer Questioned
Pitzer was asked by the Daily
last night if he had been aware of
military applications of the
contract when he described it
publicly. He declined to comment
until he could review certain
information.
Another SRI research effort
with applications in CBW is
microencapsulation. A 1968
report title issued by SRI was
"Encapsulation of Small Particles
(1-10 microns in Diameter)."
According to an SRI researcher,
encapsulation is sometimes used
on CS "in order to make it longer
lasting, so that it does not react
until it gets into people's lungs."
SRI has been reducing its
contracts from the Edgewood
CBW Arsenal since 1967. In 1968
SRI had only $404,000 in CBW,
and only $50,000 in 1969.
William Thuman, the SRI
project administrator for the
1964-67 CBW contract, says he
can "live with" the decision to
end CBW.
Physicist's Remarks
At a panel discussion in
Memorial Auditorium in
February, an SRI physicist said he
had been "coerced" into working
on a project involving tear gas
dissemination. The reseracher had
stood up to contradict a
statement by SRI President
Charles Anderson that all SRI
researchers freely choose their
areas of inquiry.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement had some critical
comments yesterday on SRl's tear
gas research. "The fact that SRI
worked on the dispersion
techniques for the tear gas used at
Berkeley is very significant," said
Fred Cohen. "Of primary
importance is that while the
technique was first intended for

use against foreign insurgents, it
will also be used against domestic
groups which threaten the status
quo."
A3M member Leonard Siegel
said, "Now we know what
counterinsurgency really means.
I've always viewed it as an
abstraction, because it was only
used overseas. But when my sister
got gassed in her house in
Berkeley, then I understood
inside.
"Many might react by saying
SRI just doesn't care what its
research is used for," said Siegel.
"In fact, we have reason to believe
that SRI has developed scenarios
for when and how to use various
weapons in urban areas."
Basic A3M Demands
The April 3rd Movement's
basic demands are for an end to
c hemical-biological, secret,
counterinsurgency, and other
Vietnam war-related research at
SRI and Stanford. The Movement
also demanded that SRI be.

them to eliminate all such

The Stanford Research Institute has
done extensive work on the technique
of aerial spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard helicopter to
disperse a crowd at Berkeley on
Tuesday.
An investigation revealed yesterday
that a large, secret SRI contract from
the Army's chemical-biological warfare
center at Edgewood, Maryland, involved
research and experimentation in aerosol
generation of CS and other
incapacitating agents.
CS, also known as "super" or
"military" tear gas, blanketed the
University of California campus and
surrounding areas when the helicopter
used 50 lbs of CS dust to break up a
crowd in Sproul Hall plaza.
According to press reports, many
gassed students fell to the ground
screaming and vomiting. The gas seeped
into homes, offices, classrooms, and the
campus hospital, which had to take
emergency measures to protect patients
with respiratory ailments.
Gas Attack Condemned
UC faculty and the mayor of
Berkeley have condemned the gas
attack. Gov. Ronald Reagan has
admitted it may have been "a tactical
mistake."
Col. Andrew Wolf, public
information officer for the National
Guard in Berkeley, described the
helicopter's equipment as "an aerosol
type of arrangement that releases dust
from a tank under high pressure. It has

been experimented with and i sed
beiore." He would give no further
details.
CS tear gas from helicopters and
airplanes has been used regularly by
U.S. troops in Vietnam to flush out
guerillas.
SRI has been doing CBW work for
the Edgewood Arsenal since the early
1950'5. CS, technically known as
chiorobenzalmalonoitrils, was invented
by the British about that time.

necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the
process of being transferred . . .
Edgewood Arsenal, the sponsor of
i!Rl's work, is the Defense Department's
research & development center for all
CBW. It supplies the Army and National
Guard.
SRl's work for Edgewood has
involved many other biological and

chemical agents besides C»J. jeymour
Hirsch, in his book Che.<>i?al and
Biological Warfare, identifies SUI as the
developer of nozzles for the aerial
dissemination of nerve gas. A
malfunction of such a nozzle caused the
death of 6,000 sheep near the Dugway
proving ground in Nevada in 1968. On
Wednesday, the Army admitted for the
first time to a House subcommittee that
the nerve gas killed the sheep, due to a
nozzle malfunction.
Aerosol dispersion of nerve gas and
CS is a difficult task.
William Perkins, a former Stanford
chemist now with Metronics Associates,
described the dissemination of CS
powder as "a very tough problem.'
Since CS is a dust, Perkins said, "you
have to avoid caking up. Particle size
distribution, electrostatic charge, and
reactivity all have to be taken into
account."
Sources at SRI said one key step in
the manufacture of CS was surface
treatment to control its reactivity with
water.
Besides high pressure dissemination,
SRI has studied extensively the use of
explosive techniques to spread CS tear
gas. Hand gernades and bombs are used
by the Army in Vietnam for this
purpose.
SRI is now working in Building 1 of
the Ravenswood complex on a project
entitled "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic Powders,"
meaning a form of CS that will resist
moisture until it comes in contact with
human mucus membranes. According to
an SRI researcher, who did not wish to
be identified, this project is specifically
intended to develop means for the
Army to spread CS over swamps and
other wet areas +n^Vietnam.
The Trustees announced May 13 that
SRI will accept no new CBW contracts.
The current chemical warfare project
should therefore be the last.
SRl's current chemical warfare
project has been described by Stanford
officials and others as an insignificant
contract without any particular military
applications.

GAS ATTACK—A National Guard helicoptcr sprays CS gas on demonstrators at Berkeley
Tuesday. SRI researched the principles of aerosol dissemination involved.
President Kenneth Pitzer told a
Dinkelspiel audience April 9 that
the contract, "which will end in
three months, is 'a study of the
behavior of non-toxic solids and
compressed hydrophobic
powders ... to learn how to
control particle size distribution
of aerosols of powders produced
by explosive dissemination."
Pitzer also said the project was
"unclassified." But SRI sources
said yesterday that all technical
reports from CBW projects are
subjected to strict controls on
distribution by the Defense
Department.

Pitzer Questioned
Pitzer was asked by the Daily
last night if he had been aware of
military applications of the
contract when he described it
publicly. He declined to comment
until he could review certain
information.
Another SRI research effort
with applications in CBW is
microencapsulation. A 1968
report title issued by SRI was
"Encapsulation of Small Particles
(1-10 microns in Diameter)."
According to an SRI researcher,
encapsulation is sometimes used
on CS "in order to make it longer
lasting, so that it does not react
until it gets into people's lungs."
SRI has been reducing its
contracts from the Edgewood
CBW Arsenal since 1967. In 1968
SRI had only $404,000 in CBW,
and only $50,000 in 1969.
William Thuman, the SRI
project administrator for the
1964-67 CBW contract, says he
can "live with" the decision to
end CBW.
Physicist's Remarks
At a panel discussion in
Memorial Auditorium in
February, an SRI physicist said he
had been "coerced" into working
on a project involving tear gas
dissemination. The reseracher had
stood up to contradict a
statement by SRI President
Charles Anderson that all SRI
researchers freely choose their
areas of inquiry.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement had some critical
comments yesterday on SRl's tear
gas research. "The fact that SRI
worked on the dispersion
techniques for the tear gas used at
Berkeley is very significant," said
Fred Cohen. "Of primary
importance is that while the
technique was first intended for

use against foreign insurgents, it
will also be used against domestic
groups which threaten the status
quo."
A3M member Leonard Siegel
said, "Now we know what
counterinsurgency really means.
I've always viewed it as an
abstraction, because it was only
used overseas. But when my sister
got gassed in her house in
Berkeley, then I understood
inside.
"Many might react by saying
SRI just doesn't care what its
research is used for," said Siegel.
"In fact, we have reason to believe
that SRI has developed scenarios
for when and how to use various
weapons in urban areas."
Basic A3M Demands
The April 3rd Movement's
basic demands are for an end to
c hemical-biological, secret,
counterinsurgency, and other
Vietnam war-related research at
SRI and Stanford. The Movement
also demanded that SRI be.

The Stanford Research Institute has
done extensive work on the technique
of aerial spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard helicopter to
disperse a crowd at Berkeley on
Tuesday.
An investigation revealed yesterday
that a large, secret SRI contract from
the Army's chemical-biological warfare
center at Edgewood, Maryland, involved
research and experimentation in aerosol
generation of CS and other
incapacitating agents.
CS, also known as "super" or
"military" tear gas, blanketed the
University of California campus and
surrounding areas when the helicopter
used 50 lbs of CS dust to break up a
crowd in Sproul Hall plaza.
According to press reports, many
gassed students fell to the ground
screaming and vomiting. The gas seeped
into homes, offices, classrooms, and the
campus hospital, which had to take
emergency measures to protect patients
with respiratory ailments.
Gas Attack Condemned
UC faculty and the mayor of
Berkeley have condemned the gas
attack. Gov. Ronald Reagan has
admitted it may have been "a tactical
mistake."
Col. Andrew Wolf, public
information officer for the National
Guard in Berkeley, described the
helicopter's equipment as "an aerosol
type of arrangement that releases dust
from a tank under high pressure. It has

been experimented with and i sed
beiore." He would give no further
details.
CS tear gas from helicopters and
airplanes has been used regularly by
U.S. troops in Vietnam to flush out
guerillas.
SRI has been doing CBW work for
the Edgewood Arsenal since the early
1950'5. CS, technically known as
chiorobenzalmalonoitrils, was invented
by the British about that time.
C'S Use Explained
The San Francisco Chronicle
yesterday quoted an Army chemical
specialist as saying that CS "hydrolizes
on contact to an acid agent which
affects mucus membranes." Besides
tears, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea,
and to some persons, sunburn-like
blistering of the skin, said the specialist.
One large CBW contract at SRI in
recent years was "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents,'' Army contract
D A-l 8-035-AMC-122(A). William C.
Thuman, SRl's administrator for this
classified project, says it ran from
1964-67, cost $2.5 billion, and
employed "dozens" of scientisis.
"We did basic studies of all feasible
methods of dissemination" of several
chemical agents, Thuman told a Daily
reporter yesterday, "including
aerosolization and dispersion of CS."
Field testing of CS dispersion was done
at SRl's Calaveras test site, said
Thuman.
One report coming out of the same
contract in 1967 was "Dissemination of

Aerosol Particles by Forming Clouds."
An SRI technical report from
Thuman's contract in 1966, made
available to the Daily yesterday by
sources outside SRI, included these
excerpts:
"The objective of this research
program is to provide fundamental
information necessary for overall
improvement of dissemination
techniques applicable to chemical
munitions. Every effort is being made to
coordinate the program at Stanford
Research Institute with the
requirements of Edgewood Arsenal so
that information derived from this
program can be utilized most effectively
by the U.S. Army . . .
The report goes on to say that one of
the goals is experimentation with
"aeroparticulate material to produce an
effective cloud of the desired agent."
A later excerpt states, "Work with
CS pyrotechniques has been temporarily
curtailed. It has proved impractical to
handle CS in buildings and laboratories
shared with other projects due to the
low tolerance level of several workers on
the other projects. It was, therefore,
necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the

GAS ATTACK—A National Guard helicoptcr sprays CS gas on demonstrators at Berkeley
Tuesday. SRI researched the principles of aerosol dissemination involved.
President Kenneth Pitzer told a
Dinkelspiel audience April 9 that
the contract, "which will end in
three months, is 'a study of the
behavior of non-toxic solids and
compressed hydrophobic
powders ... to learn how to
control particle size distribution
of aerosols of powders produced
by explosive dissemination."
Pitzer also said the project was
"unclassified." But SRI sources
said yesterday that all technical
reports from CBW projects are
subjected to strict controls on
distribution by the Defense
Department.

Pitzer Questioned
Pitzer was asked by the Daily
last night if he had been aware of
military applications of the
contract when he described it
publicly. He declined to comment
until he could review certain
information.
Another SRI research effort
with applications in CBW is
microencapsulation. A 1968
report title issued by SRI was
"Encapsulation of Small Particles
(1-10 microns in Diameter)."
According to an SRI researcher,
encapsulation is sometimes used
on CS "in order to make it longer
lasting, so that it does not react
until it gets into people's lungs."
SRI has been reducing its
contracts from the Edgewood
CBW Arsenal since 1967. In 1968
SRI had only $404,000 in CBW,
and only $50,000 in 1969.
William Thuman, the SRI
project administrator for the
1964-67 CBW contract, says he
can "live with" the decision to
end CBW.
Physicist's Remarks
At a panel discussion in
Memorial Auditorium in
February, an SRI physicist said he
had been "coerced" into working
on a project involving tear gas
dissemination. The reseracher had
stood up to contradict a
statement by SRI President
Charles Anderson that all SRI
researchers freely choose their
areas of inquiry.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement had some critical
comments yesterday on SRl's tear
gas research. "The fact that SRI
worked on the dispersion
techniques for the tear gas used at
Berkeley is very significant," said
Fred Cohen. "Of primary
importance is that while the
technique was first intended for

use against foreign insurgents, it
will also be used against domestic
groups which threaten the status
quo."
A3M member Leonard Siegel
said, "Now we know what
counterinsurgency really means.
I've always viewed it as an
abstraction, because it was only
used overseas. But when my sister
got gassed in her house in
Berkeley, then I understood
inside.
"Many might react by saying
SRI just doesn't care what its
research is used for," said Siegel.
"In fact, we have reason to believe
that SRI has developed scenarios
for when and how to use various
weapons in urban areas."
Basic A3M Demands
The April 3rd Movement's
basic demands are for an end to

counterinsurgency, and other
Vietnam war-related research at
SRI and Stanford. The Movement
also demanded that SRI be.

The Stanford Research Institute has
done extensive work on the technique
of aerial spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard helicopter to
disperse a crowd at Berkeley on
Tuesday.
An investigation revealed yesterday
that a large, secret SRI contract from
the Army's chemical-biological warfare
center at Edgewood, Maryland, involved
research and experimentation in aerosol
generation of CS and other
incapacitating agents.
CS, also known as "super" or
"military" tear gas, blanketed the
University of California campus and
surrounding areas when the helicopter
used 50 lbs of CS dust to break up a
crowd in Sproul Hall plaza.
According to press reports, many
gassed students fell to the ground
screaming and vomiting. The gas seeped
into homes, offices, classrooms, and the
campus hospital, which had to take
emergency measures to protect patients
with respiratory ailments.
Gas Attack Condemned
UC faculty and the mayor of
Berkeley have condemned the gas
attack. Gov. Ronald Reagan has
admitted it may have been "a tactical
mistake."
Col. Andrew Wolf, public
information officer for the National
Guard in Berkeley, described the
helicopter's equipment as "an aerosol
type of arrangement that releases dust
from a tank under high pressure. It has

been experimented with and i sed
beiore." He would give no further
details.
CS tear gas from helicopters and
airplanes has been used regularly by
U.S. troops in Vietnam to flush out
guerillas.
SRI has been doing CBW work for
the Edgewood Arsenal since the early
1950'5. CS, technically known as
chiorobenzalmalonoitrils, was invented
by the British about that time.
C'S Use Explained
The San Francisco Chronicle
yesterday quoted an Army chemical
specialist as saying that CS "hydrolizes
on contact to an acid agent which
affects mucus membranes." Besides
tears, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea,
and to some persons, sunburn-like
blistering of the skin, said the specialist.
One large CBW contract at SRI in
recent years was "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents,'' Army contract
D A-l 8-035-AMC-122(A). William C.
Thuman, SRl's administrator for this
classified project, says it ran from
1964-67, cost $2.5 billion, and
employed "dozens" of scientisis.
"We did basic studies of all feasible
methods of dissemination" of several
chemical agents, Thuman told a Daily
reporter yesterday, "including
aerosolization and dispersion of CS."
Field testing of CS dispersion was done
at SRl's Calaveras test site, said
Thuman.
One report coming out of the same
contract in 1967 was "Dissemination of

Aerosol Particles by Forming Clouds."
An SRI technical report from
Thuman's contract in 1966, made
available to the Daily yesterday by
sources outside SRI, included these
excerpts:
"The objective of this research
program is to provide fundamental
information necessary for overall
improvement of dissemination
techniques applicable to chemical
munitions. Every effort is being made to
coordinate the program at Stanford
Research Institute with the
requirements of Edgewood Arsenal so
that information derived from this
program can be utilized most effectively
by the U.S. Army . . .
The report goes on to say that one of
the goals is experimentation with
"aeroparticulate material to produce an
effective cloud of the desired agent."
A later excerpt states, "Work with
CS pyrotechniques has been temporarily
curtailed. It has proved impractical to
handle CS in buildings and laboratories
shared with other projects due to the
low tolerance level of several workers on
the other projects. It was, therefore,
necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the
process of being transferred . . .
Edgewood Arsenal, the sponsor of
i!Rl's work, is the Defense Department's
research & development center for all
CBW. It supplies the Army and National
Guard.
SRl's work for Edgewood has
involved many other biological and

chemical agents besides C»J. jeymour
Hirsch, in his book Che.<>i?al and
Biological Warfare, identifies SUI as the
developer of nozzles for the aerial
dissemination of nerve gas. A
malfunction of such a nozzle caused the
death of 6,000 sheep near the Dugway
proving ground in Nevada in 1968. On
Wednesday, the Army admitted for the
first time to a House subcommittee that
the nerve gas killed the sheep, due to a
nozzle malfunction.
Aerosol dispersion of nerve gas and
CS is a difficult task.
William Perkins, a former Stanford
chemist now with Metronics Associates,
described the dissemination of CS
powder as "a very tough problem.'
Since CS is a dust, Perkins said, "you
have to avoid caking up. Particle size
distribution, electrostatic charge, and
reactivity all have to be taken into
account."
Sources at SRI said one key step in
the manufacture of CS was surface
treatment to control its reactivity with
water.
Besides high pressure dissemination,
SRI has studied extensively the use of
explosive techniques to spread CS tear
gas. Hand gernades and bombs are used
by the Army in Vietnam for this
purpose.
SRI is now working in Building 1 of
the Ravenswood complex on a project
entitled "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic Powders,"
meaning a form of CS that will resist
moisture until it comes in contact with
human mucus membranes. According to
an SRI researcher, who did not wish to
be identified, this project is specifically
intended to develop means for the
Army to spread CS over swamps and
other wet areas +n^Vietnam.
The Trustees announced May 13 that
SRI will accept no new CBW contracts.

and only $50,000 in 1969.
William Thuman, the SRI
project administrator for the
1964-67 CBW contract, says he
can "live with" the decision to
end CBW.
Physicist's Remarks
At a panel discussion in
Memorial Auditorium in
February, an SRI physicist said he
had been "coerced" into working
on a project involving tear gas
dissemination. The reseracher had
stood up to contradict a
statement by SRI President
Charles Anderson that all SRI
researchers freely choose their
areas of inquiry.
Members of the April 3rd
Movement had some critical
comments yesterday on SRl's tear
gas research. "The fact that SRI
worked on the dispersion
techniques for the tear gas used at
Berkeley is very significant," said
Fred Cohen. "Of primary
importance is that while the
technique was first intended for

use against foreign insurgents, it
will also be used against domestic
groups which threaten the status
quo."
A3M member Leonard Siegel
said, "Now we know what
counterinsurgency really means.
I've always viewed it as an
abstraction, because it was only
used overseas. But when my sister
got gassed in her house in
Berkeley, then I understood
inside.
"Many might react by saying
SRI just doesn't care what its
research is used for," said Siegel.
"In fact, we have reason to believe
that SRI has developed scenarios
for when and how to use various
weapons in urban areas."
Basic A3M Demands

The Stanford Research Institute has
done extensive work on the technique
of aerial spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard helicopter to
disperse a crowd at Berkeley on
Tuesday.
An investigation revealed yesterday
that a large, secret SRI contract from
the Army's chemical-biological warfare
center at Edgewood, Maryland, involved
research and experimentation in aerosol
generation of CS and other
incapacitating agents.
CS, also known as "super" or
"military" tear gas, blanketed the
University of California campus and
surrounding areas when the helicopter
used 50 lbs of CS dust to break up a
crowd in Sproul Hall plaza.
According to press reports, many
gassed students fell to the ground
screaming and vomiting. The gas seeped
into homes, offices, classrooms, and the
campus hospital, which had to take
emergency measures to protect patients
with respiratory ailments.
Gas Attack Condemned
UC faculty and the mayor of
Berkeley have condemned the gas
attack. Gov. Ronald Reagan has
admitted it may have been "a tactical
mistake."
Col. Andrew Wolf, public
information officer for the National
Guard in Berkeley, described the
helicopter's equipment as "an aerosol
type of arrangement that releases dust
from a tank under high pressure. It has

been experimented with and i sed
beiore." He would give no further
details.
CS tear gas from helicopters and
airplanes has been used regularly by
U.S. troops in Vietnam to flush out
guerillas.
SRI has been doing CBW work for
the Edgewood Arsenal since the early
1950'5. CS, technically known as
chiorobenzalmalonoitrils, was invented
by the British about that time.
C'S Use Explained
The San Francisco Chronicle
yesterday quoted an Army chemical
specialist as saying that CS "hydrolizes
on contact to an acid agent which
affects mucus membranes." Besides
tears, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea,
and to some persons, sunburn-like
blistering of the skin, said the specialist.
One large CBW contract at SRI in
recent years was "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents,'' Army contract
D A-l 8-035-AMC-122(A). William C.
Thuman, SRl's administrator for this
classified project, says it ran from
1964-67, cost $2.5 billion, and
employed "dozens" of scientisis.
"We did basic studies of all feasible
methods of dissemination" of several
chemical agents, Thuman told a Daily
reporter yesterday, "including
aerosolization and dispersion of CS."
Field testing of CS dispersion was done
at SRl's Calaveras test site, said
Thuman.
One report coming out of the same
contract in 1967 was "Dissemination of

Aerosol Particles by Forming Clouds."
An SRI technical report from
Thuman's contract in 1966, made
available to the Daily yesterday by
sources outside SRI, included these
excerpts:
"The objective of this research
program is to provide fundamental
information necessary for overall
improvement of dissemination
techniques applicable to chemical
munitions. Every effort is being made to
coordinate the program at Stanford
Research Institute with the
requirements of Edgewood Arsenal so
that information derived from this
program can be utilized most effectively
by the U.S. Army . . .
The report goes on to say that one of
the goals is experimentation with
"aeroparticulate material to produce an
effective cloud of the desired agent."
A later excerpt states, "Work with
CS pyrotechniques has been temporarily
curtailed. It has proved impractical to
handle CS in buildings and laboratories
shared with other projects due to the
low tolerance level of several workers on
the other projects. It was, therefore,
necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the
process of being transferred . . .
Edgewood Arsenal, the sponsor of
i!Rl's work, is the Defense Department's
research & development center for all
CBW. It supplies the Army and National
Guard.
SRl's work for Edgewood has
involved many other biological and

chemical agents besides C»J. jeymour
Hirsch, in his book Che.<>i?al and
Biological Warfare, identifies SUI as the
developer of nozzles for the aerial
dissemination of nerve gas. A
malfunction of such a nozzle caused the
death of 6,000 sheep near the Dugway
proving ground in Nevada in 1968. On
Wednesday, the Army admitted for the
first time to a House subcommittee that
the nerve gas killed the sheep, due to a
nozzle malfunction.
Aerosol dispersion of nerve gas and
CS is a difficult task.
William Perkins, a former Stanford
chemist now with Metronics Associates,
described the dissemination of CS
powder as "a very tough problem.'
Since CS is a dust, Perkins said, "you
have to avoid caking up. Particle size
distribution, electrostatic charge, and
reactivity all have to be taken into
account."
Sources at SRI said one key step in
the manufacture of CS was surface
treatment to control its reactivity with
water.
Besides high pressure dissemination,
SRI has studied extensively the use of
explosive techniques to spread CS tear
gas. Hand gernades and bombs are used
by the Army in Vietnam for this
purpose.
SRI is now working in Building 1 of
the Ravenswood complex on a project
entitled "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic Powders,"
meaning a form of CS that will resist
moisture until it comes in contact with
human mucus membranes. According to
an SRI researcher, who did not wish to
be identified, this project is specifically
intended to develop means for the
Army to spread CS over swamps and
other wet areas +n^Vietnam.
The Trustees announced May 13 that
SRI will accept no new CBW contracts.
The current chemical warfare project
should therefore be the last.
SRl's current chemical warfare
project has been described by Stanford
officials and others as an insignificant
contract without any particular military
applications.

GAS ATTACK—A National Guard helicoptcr sprays CS gas on demonstrators at Berkeley
Tuesday. SRI researched the principles of aerosol dissemination involved.
President Kenneth Pitzer told a
Dinkelspiel audience April 9 that
the contract, "which will end in
three months, is 'a study of the
behavior of non-toxic solids and
compressed hydrophobic
powders ... to learn how to
control particle size distribution
of aerosols of powders produced
by explosive dissemination."
Pitzer also said the project was
"unclassified." But SRI sources
said yesterday that all technical
reports from CBW projects are
subjected to strict controls on
distribution by the Defense
Department.

Pitzer Questioned
Pitzer was asked by the Daily
last night if he had been aware of
military applications of the
contract when he described it
publicly. He declined to comment
until he could review certain
information.
Another SRI research effort
with applications in CBW is
microencapsulation. A 1968
report title issued by SRI was
"Encapsulation of Small Particles
(1-10 microns in Diameter)."
According to an SRI researcher,
encapsulation is sometimes used
on CS "in order to make it longer
lasting, so that it does not react
until it gets into people's lungs."
SRI has been reducing its
contracts from the Edgewood
CBW Arsenal since 1967. In 1968
SRI had only $404,000 in CBW,
and only $50,000 in 1969.
William Thuman, the SRI
project administrator for the
1964-67 CBW contract, says he
can "live with" the decision to
end CBW.
