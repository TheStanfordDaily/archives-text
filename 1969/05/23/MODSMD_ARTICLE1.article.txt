# Copter Gas Attack Used SRI Research

The Stanford Research Institute has
done extensive work on the technique
of aerial spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard helicopter to
disperse a crowd at Berkeley on
Tuesday.
An investigation revealed yesterday
that a large, secret SRI contract from
the Army's chemical-biological warfare
center at Edgewood, Maryland, involved
research and experimentation in aerosol
generation of CS and other
incapacitating agents.
CS, also known as "super" or
"military" tear gas, blanketed the
University of California campus and
surrounding areas when the helicopter
used 50 lbs of CS dust to break up a
crowd in Sproul Hall plaza.
According to press reports, many
gassed students fell to the ground
screaming and vomiting. The gas seeped
into homes, offices, classrooms, and the
campus hospital, which had to take
emergency measures to protect patients
with respiratory ailments.
Gas Attack Condemned
UC faculty and the mayor of
Berkeley have condemned the gas
attack. Gov. Ronald Reagan has
admitted it may have been "a tactical
mistake."
Col. Andrew Wolf, public
information officer for the National
Guard in Berkeley, described the
helicopter's equipment as "an aerosol
type of arrangement that releases dust
from a tank under high pressure. It has

been experimented with and i sed
beiore." He would give no further
details.
CS tear gas from helicopters and
airplanes has been used regularly by
U.S. troops in Vietnam to flush out
guerillas.
SRI has been doing CBW work for
the Edgewood Arsenal since the early
1950'5. CS, technically known as
chiorobenzalmalonoitrils, was invented
by the British about that time.
C'S Use Explained
The San Francisco Chronicle
yesterday quoted an Army chemical
specialist as saying that CS "hydrolizes
on contact to an acid agent which
affects mucus membranes." Besides
tears, it can cause vomiting, diarrhea,
and to some persons, sunburn-like
blistering of the skin, said the specialist.
One large CBW contract at SRI in
recent years was "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents,'' Army contract
D A-l 8-035-AMC-122(A). William C.
Thuman, SRl's administrator for this
classified project, says it ran from
1964-67, cost $2.5 billion, and
employed "dozens" of scientisis.
"We did basic studies of all feasible
methods of dissemination" of several
chemical agents, Thuman told a Daily
reporter yesterday, "including
aerosolization and dispersion of CS."
Field testing of CS dispersion was done
at SRl's Calaveras test site, said
Thuman.
One report coming out of the same
contract in 1967 was "Dissemination of

Aerosol Particles by Forming Clouds."
An SRI technical report from
Thuman's contract in 1966, made
available to the Daily yesterday by
sources outside SRI, included these
excerpts:
"The objective of this research
program is to provide fundamental
information necessary for overall
improvement of dissemination
techniques applicable to chemical
munitions. Every effort is being made to
coordinate the program at Stanford
Research Institute with the
requirements of Edgewood Arsenal so
that information derived from this
program can be utilized most effectively
by the U.S. Army . . .
The report goes on to say that one of
the goals is experimentation with
"aeroparticulate material to produce an
effective cloud of the desired agent."
A later excerpt states, "Work with
CS pyrotechniques has been temporarily
curtailed. It has proved impractical to
handle CS in buildings and laboratories
shared with other projects due to the
low tolerance level of several workers on
the other projects. It was, therefore,
necessary to completely isolate the
project from the others and all
operations at Calaveras Site are in the
process of being transferred . . .
Edgewood Arsenal, the sponsor of
i!Rl's work, is the Defense Department's
research & development center for all
CBW. It supplies the Army and National
Guard.
SRl's work for Edgewood has
involved many other biological and

chemical agents besides C»J. jeymour
Hirsch, in his book Che.<>i?al and
Biological Warfare, identifies SUI as the
developer of nozzles for the aerial
dissemination of nerve gas. A
malfunction of such a nozzle caused the
death of 6,000 sheep near the Dugway
proving ground in Nevada in 1968. On
Wednesday, the Army admitted for the
first time to a House subcommittee that
the nerve gas killed the sheep, due to a
nozzle malfunction.
Aerosol dispersion of nerve gas and
CS is a difficult task.
William Perkins, a former Stanford
chemist now with Metronics Associates,
described the dissemination of CS
powder as "a very tough problem.'
Since CS is a dust, Perkins said, "you
have to avoid caking up. Particle size
distribution, electrostatic charge, and
reactivity all have to be taken into
account."
Sources at SRI said one key step in
the manufacture of CS was surface
treatment to control its reactivity with
water.
Besides high pressure dissemination,
SRI has studied extensively the use of
explosive techniques to spread CS tear
gas. Hand gernades and bombs are used
by the Army in Vietnam for this
purpose.
SRI is now working in Building 1 of
the Ravenswood complex on a project
entitled "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic Powders,"
meaning a form of CS that will resist
moisture until it comes in contact with
human mucus membranes. According to
an SRI researcher, who did not wish to
be identified, this project is specifically
intended to develop means for the
Army to spread CS over swamps and
other wet areas +n^Vietnam.
The Trustees announced May 13 that
SRI will accept no new CBW contracts.
The current chemical warfare project
should therefore be the last.
SRl's current chemical warfare
project has been described by Stanford
officials and others as an insignificant
contract without any particular military
applications.
