## Co-Education Ebbs, Flows 
### V.K. Vaid Raizada 
Until the dawn of the 19ti.
century, it was argued that
co-education would effiminate the
boys and make the girls coarser.
The great social, political and
economic changes that have taken
place since, have eroded that
narrow way of thinking.
The development of
secularism, increased civil liberties
and women's struggle for equality
brought, in the West, co-education
to many schools and universities.
It was the christian missionary
educationist who introduced this
idea in the East. But co-education
in the East did not flourish until
somewhat later. It was, in fact, the
need for mass participation in the
national movements for
independence that brought the
Asian women out of the homes.
The movements for
independence also turned out to
be the movements for greater
opportunity for women in many
fields. With limited facilities for
separate education, co-education
was inevitable.
Extent Of Co-Education
What is the extent of
co-education? The highest
percentage of mixed classes are

found in U.S.S.R. and East
European countries, almost 100
per cent. Europe ranks second
with 35 per cent, South America
has 33 per cent, North America
28 per cent, Asia 25 per cent and
Africa is at the bottom with 7 per
cent.
The almost unbelievable
change to full co-education in the
communist world has been
brought through ordinances
declaring that "all educational
establishments shall admit
students of both sexes to the
available vacancies on conditions
of equality."
In the West, where the
co-education developed out of a
slow evolutionary process, no
legislative provisions were
necessary. But in many
underveloped countries, because
this change was more radical, their
constitutions provide that the
mixed classes be recognized in
education.
There are only four countries,
all in the Middle East, in which a
rigid separation is practiced. Two
of them, Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain, have a legalized separate
system.

There is no significant
difference in the proportion of
girls enrolled in co-educationsl
classes between the urban and
rural areas in the developed
countries. But in the developing
countries the more urbanized a
region, the more likelihood of a
great proportion of girls enrolled.
In both the developing and
developed countries the
proportion of girls falls
progressively with the increase in
the level of education. The
enrollment of women is the
lowest in engineering schools and
the schools of management and
advanced business.
It is interesting to note that
when the general opinion is that

the boys and girls "be taught the
same things, at the same time, in
the same place, by the same
faculty, with the same methods,"
there are a few countries, such as
Morocco and Republic of
Viet-Nam, which are considering
the reintroduction of separate
classes.

There is no significant
difference in the proportion of
girls enrolled in co-educationsl
classes between the urban and
rural areas in the developed
countries. But in the developing
countries the more urbanized a
region, the more likelihood of a
great proportion of girls enrolled.
In both the developing and
developed countries the
proportion of girls falls
progressively with the increase in
the level of education. The
enrollment of women is the
lowest in engineering schools and
the schools of management and
advanced business.
It is interesting to note that
when the general opinion is that

the boys and girls "be taught the
same things, at the same time, in
the same place, by the same
faculty, with the same methods,"
there are a few countries, such as
Morocco and Republic of
Viet-Nam, which are considering
the reintroduction of separate
classes.

Until the dawn of the 19ti.
century, it was argued that
co-education would effiminate the
boys and make the girls coarser.
The great social, political and
economic changes that have taken
place since, have eroded that
narrow way of thinking.
The development of
secularism, increased civil liberties
and women's struggle for equality
brought, in the West, co-education
to many schools and universities.
It was the christian missionary
educationist who introduced this
idea in the East. But co-education
in the East did not flourish until
somewhat later. It was, in fact, the
need for mass participation in the
national movements for
independence that brought the
Asian women out of the homes.
The movements for
independence also turned out to
be the movements for greater
opportunity for women in many
fields. With limited facilities for
separate education, co-education
was inevitable.
Extent Of Co-Education
What is the extent of
co-education? The highest
percentage of mixed classes are

found in U.S.S.R. and East
European countries, almost 100
per cent. Europe ranks second
with 35 per cent, South America
has 33 per cent, North America
28 per cent, Asia 25 per cent and
Africa is at the bottom with 7 per
cent.
The almost unbelievable
change to full co-education in the
communist world has been
brought through ordinances
declaring that "all educational
establishments shall admit
students of both sexes to the
available vacancies on conditions
of equality."
In the West, where the
co-education developed out of a
slow evolutionary process, no
legislative provisions were
necessary. But in many
underveloped countries, because
this change was more radical, their
constitutions provide that the
mixed classes be recognized in
education.
There are only four countries,
all in the Middle East, in which a
rigid separation is practiced. Two
of them, Saudi Arabia and
Bahrain, have a legalized separate
system.
