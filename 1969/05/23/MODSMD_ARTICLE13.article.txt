## Who Determines Suitability? 
### Marc Sapir 
Friday, May 23, Stanford's
liberal medical school faculty will
add the following statement to
the requirements for graduation:
" . . .suitability for the practice of
medicine as evidenced by effective
professional relations with
patients and colleagues, the
assumption of responsibility for
patient care, and integrity in the
conduct of clinical and research
activities is required for the degree
of Doctor of Medicine."
Ironically, the rules of the
Academic Senate of the Medical
School, like those of academic in
general, suggest that the
"suitability clause" or any other
legislation proposed by a
committee of the Senate need not
be ratified in order to become
law. Non-action on the suitability
clause will bring it into effect as a
valid criterion for graduation: I'm
not responsible.
"I'm not responsible for Vietnam,
counterinsurgency or the arms race,"
cries Ken (we must rearrange our
priorities) Pitzer. (Who sits on the Air
Force's counter insurgency RAND
Corp? Who attacked Linus Pauling and
J.R. Oppenheimer for their stands vs.
nuclear proliferation? Who is heavily
involved in Aero-Space industry? Who
wants more arrests?)
"I'm not responsible for Vietnam,
for political repression, National Guard
in Berkeley, 70 students on suspension,
or the climate of fear and
intimidation," cries the faculty. (Who
hides in labs? Who insists on publish or
perish? Who serves as finks,
prosecutors, judges, and jury against
students? Who supports injunctions
and police actions for law and order?
Who turns away blacks and poor
people from their hospital? Who trains
students to care more about status,
self-image, and diseases, than about
people and health? Who thinks the
practice of medicine is based upon
"effective professional relations"?
Of course, the med school
faculty has a justification for their
suitability clause. The justification
talks about the reputation of
Stanford Medical Center and the
lives of patients being endangered
by doctors who are psychotic,
thieves, perverts, frauds, etc. But
the profession is already full of
those people—only professional
prostitutes have a higher drug
addiction rate than doctors, and

about 40% of private psychiatric
time is taken up by doctors and
their facilies—so what is suitability
all about?
Conformity
■Suitability is about
conformity; it's about keeping the
profession sterile; it's about
maintaining a clear definition of
the class lines in a class society. A
couple of progressive medical
school faculty have suggested to
me that the suitability clause is
directed primarily against the
blacks and chicanos who have
been recruited for next year's
class and only secondarily against
white radicals. Radical students at
the medical school have seen that
intimidation of this kinds works
more effectively against the few
black brothers because they are
isolated and have had to fight so
much harder to get anywhere at
all in this society. They
understand the nature of White
Power and they know they are
being watched.
Medicine is so self-righteously
smug and proud of itself. It
actually believes that you have to
be something special in order to
be a doctor. Thus, one faculty
member has already raised the
idea that black students who
don't measure up (is that
academically or via suitability?)
should be entered in a special
program and given a Jr. Doctor
degree.
From my viewpoint the
suitability clause is an attempt to
control thought and action of
medical students. Throughout the
medical school students are hit
with an alternating barrage of
intimidation and paternalism.
Professional conduct is then
defined as taking your medicine
and liking it. Don't talk back;
don't resist; take all the shit you
deserve as an underlying and later
give it back to the people who
deserve it —your alcoholic patients
who should know better, the
pathetic medical student who
works under you during your
residency, the hippies, the
no-goodniks, the nurses and
orderlies, if you ever find time to
interact with them.
Refusal
Two months ago I publicly
refused to participate in a seminar
run by a psychiatrist who sits on
the SJC (Judicial Council). He had
just suspended my wife, Carrie
Iverson, and 28 others for doing
what they believed in (on Jan. 14
they demanded that the Trustees
get out of S.E. Asia). As a result
of that incident I was almost
failed in psychiatry, because,
according to the recommendation
of the same professor "the
student lacks a sense of
proportion in and judgement in
his relationship to his peers nad to
the faculty." (Anyone interested
in my actual performance with
patients in psychiatry can talk
with Dr. Don Lunde, Dr. Frank
Hilf or Dr. Bill Van Reenan).
The reader may note some
similarity in that recommendation
exerpt above and the suitability 1
clause itself. Had the clause been
in effect, Herb Liederman, who
wields a great deal of power in his
department, could have thrown
me out of school without even
feeling guilty about it, because the
clause would back him up.
(Incidentally, Liederman is on the
committee which has submitted
the suitability clause although he
reportedly did not write it.)
"I'm not responsible" says the
faculty! "Suitability is really
important."

The suitability clause cannot
stop those already involved in
radical politics at the medical
school (about 20 med students),
but it can change the political
climate at the school. A
tremendous effort is already
underway from reactionary
elements to keep out all political
activists who apply to Stanford.
At least one member of the
Admissions committee has
dedicated himself to this task.
Climate
I'he day alter the assasination
of Black Panther Bunchy Carter in
L.A. this very same doctor goaded
me as I walked by him, "did you
hear about that Panther who was

killed? Well, I lent my gun to the
guys who did it." No one is
questioning that doctors'
suitability or the suitability of an
obstetrician who slapped a
student in the face when he asked
if he could attend a protest march
and postpone presentation of a
paper. And no one ever will.
Who determines suitability?
The people with power, brother.
Power to the people.
