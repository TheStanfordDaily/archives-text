## Why Not Everybody? 
### Barbara Levin 
"Why me?" were the first two
words that crossed my mind when
I learned that I had been enjoined.
The thought hit like a muscle
spasm after a blow. In shock, my
head spun: "Why me? I was in the
legal picket line . . ." It all seemed
so random.
Later, when I learned that
Harvey Hukari had signed the
affidavits, I was infuriated. He had
been on the same side of the
street as I had. He was equipped
with a bullhorn to cause a
disturbance, and I had only my
picket sign.
However, Harvey's accusations
did not attest to my participation
at SRI. He simply said that I had
spoken at a meeting, failing to
take note of what I had said.
The Irony of It All
The tone of the injunction to
which Harvey's affidavits are
attached implies group
responsibilities for all that went
on at SRI. I found it somewhat
ironic that Harvey—the one
person who disclaims any
"collective responsibility" on his
part for research policy on
campus or for the Vietnam
atrocities—would implicate others
upon these same grounds.
As I mulled over the idea of
"collective responsibility," my
mind traced my own activities
during the last six stormy weeks.
In discussions with myself and
others, I had often been dubious
about what the movement should
or should not do.
I often had to weigh the
responsibilities of being a group
member against responsibilities of
thinking and acting critically. For
me, the best decision was to make
a self-guided commitment—to do
my own thing—within the group

and support the community in
this way.
Internal Critic
I found my place in the April 3
meetings to be much the same as
the New Left's place in the wider
society. I felt it important to
speak out when I disagreed as well
as when I agreed. If the majority
decided against me, then I had to
choose my action according to my
own conscience.
Last Thursday, I spent most of
the day thinking about what
Friday could mean for the
Movement—and for me. Like
many other "moderates" on
campus, I was confused about the
courses of action open. I knew I
might disagree with much that
went on at SRI—but I had to
express my personal disgust with
the Trustees' decision. All
traditional channels—my old
standbys—had failed. I decided to
go picket legally because it was
the only thing I personally could
do. But I also wanted to show my
support for the Movement.
Yes, I guess I do accept
"collective responsibility" for the
actions of the April 3 Movement
although I have always acted
legally and even spoken against
certain tactics. When I think of
the alternatives —of supporting
either openly or tacitly (by
inaction) the way things are on
this campus, at SRI, and in this
country, I realize my full support
lies behind those who want
changes which I feel are
imperative and who are willing to
act honestly (if not always wisely)
to do something about them.
Randomness Rampart
I remembered the randomness
of my "responsibilitiy" again. It
did seem peculiar . . . but not

really unique. Much of life is just
such a lottery. Some guys go to
Viet Nam, others don't . . . still
others don't return. And, who
decides which child is born in the
ghetto and which one is a
suburbanite?
Harvey had decided that I was
to be enjoined. That thought
became easier for me to accept. I
realized that I, too, held
individuals responsible for actions
of their associates and groups.
Nuremburg Trials or not the
world was wrong to let Hitler do
his thing . . . just as Americans are
wrong for failing to oppose the
inhumanity of the Viet Nam
situation.
For six weeks I have been
saying that all the campus must be
concerned (?) about research
policy. I also hold all the SRI
administrators and researchers and
staff responsible for the CBW and
counter-insurgency work which
goes on over there—no matter in
which department they personally
are involved.
Two More Injunctions
As I accept my injunction -its
randomness, illegality and all, I
issue two of my own: (1)1 enjoin
all SRI employees (John Does 1
through 3000) against all CBW
and war-related research and
against the failure to establish
their own guidelines for research
in their corporation. (2) I enjoin
all American citizens (John Does
1 through 200 million) against
failing to wake and realize what is
really wrong in this country.
The question is not "WHY
ME? but "WHY NOT
EVERYBODY?"

the social thought program-Ed.)

this campus, at SRI, and in this
country, I realize my full support
lies behind those who want
changes which I feel are
imperative and who are willing to
act honestly (if not always wisely)
to do something about them.
Randomness Rampart
I remembered the randomness
of my "responsibilitiy" again. It
did seem peculiar . . . but not

really unique. Much of life is just
such a lottery. Some guys go to
Viet Nam, others don't . . . still
others don't return. And, who
decides which child is born in the
ghetto and which one is a
suburbanite?
Harvey had decided that I was
to be enjoined. That thought
became easier for me to accept. I
realized that I, too, held
individuals responsible for actions
of their associates and groups.
Nuremburg Trials or not the
world was wrong to let Hitler do
his thing . . . just as Americans are
wrong for failing to oppose the
inhumanity of the Viet Nam
situation.
For six weeks I have been
saying that all the campus must be
concerned (?) about research
policy. I also hold all the SRI
administrators and researchers and
staff responsible for the CBW and
counter-insurgency work which
goes on over there—no matter in
which department they personally
are involved.
Two More Injunctions
As I accept my injunction -its
randomness, illegality and all, I
issue two of my own: (1)1 enjoin
all SRI employees (John Does 1
through 3000) against all CBW
and war-related research and
against the failure to establish
their own guidelines for research
in their corporation. (2) I enjoin
all American citizens (John Does
1 through 200 million) against
failing to wake and realize what is
really wrong in this country.
The question is not "WHY
ME? but "WHY NOT
EVERYBODY?"
(Barbara Levin is a senior in
the social thought program-Ed.)
"Why me?" were the first two
words that crossed my mind when
I learned that I had been enjoined.
The thought hit like a muscle
spasm after a blow. In shock, my
head spun: "Why me? I was in the
legal picket line . . ." It all seemed
so random.
Later, when I learned that
Harvey Hukari had signed the
affidavits, I was infuriated. He had
been on the same side of the
street as I had. He was equipped
with a bullhorn to cause a
disturbance, and I had only my
picket sign.
However, Harvey's accusations
did not attest to my participation
at SRI. He simply said that I had
spoken at a meeting, failing to
take note of what I had said.
The Irony of It All
The tone of the injunction to
which Harvey's affidavits are
attached implies group
responsibilities for all that went
on at SRI. I found it somewhat
ironic that Harvey—the one
person who disclaims any
"collective responsibility" on his
part for research policy on
campus or for the Vietnam
atrocities—would implicate others
upon these same grounds.
As I mulled over the idea of
"collective responsibility," my
mind traced my own activities
during the last six stormy weeks.
In discussions with myself and
others, I had often been dubious
about what the movement should
or should not do.
I often had to weigh the
responsibilities of being a group
member against responsibilities of
thinking and acting critically. For
me, the best decision was to make
a self-guided commitment—to do
my own thing—within the group

and support the community in
this way.
Internal Critic
I found my place in the April 3
meetings to be much the same as
the New Left's place in the wider
society. I felt it important to
speak out when I disagreed as well
as when I agreed. If the majority
decided against me, then I had to
choose my action according to my
own conscience.
Last Thursday, I spent most of
the day thinking about what
Friday could mean for the
Movement—and for me. Like
many other "moderates" on
campus, I was confused about the
courses of action open. I knew I
might disagree with much that
went on at SRI—but I had to
express my personal disgust with
the Trustees' decision. All
traditional channels—my old
standbys—had failed. I decided to
go picket legally because it was
the only thing I personally could
do. But I also wanted to show my
support for the Movement.
Yes, I guess I do accept
"collective responsibility" for the
actions of the April 3 Movement
although I have always acted
legally and even spoken against
certain tactics. When I think of
the alternatives —of supporting
either openly or tacitly (by
inaction) the way things are on
this campus, at SRI, and in this
country, I realize my full support
lies behind those who want
changes which I feel are
imperative and who are willing to

on at SRI. I found it somewhat
ironic that Harvey—the one
person who disclaims any
"collective responsibility" on his
part for research policy on
campus or for the Vietnam
atrocities—would implicate others
upon these same grounds.
As I mulled over the idea of
"collective responsibility," my
mind traced my own activities
during the last six stormy weeks.
In discussions with myself and
others, I had often been dubious
about what the movement should
or should not do.
I often had to weigh the
responsibilities of being a group
member against responsibilities of
thinking and acting critically. For
me, the best decision was to make
a self-guided commitment—to do
my own thing—within the group

and support the community in
this way.
Internal Critic
I found my place in the April 3
meetings to be much the same as
the New Left's place in the wider
society. I felt it important to
speak out when I disagreed as well
as when I agreed. If the majority
decided against me, then I had to
choose my action according to my
own conscience.
Last Thursday, I spent most of
the day thinking about what
Friday could mean for the
Movement—and for me. Like
many other "moderates" on
campus, I was confused about the
courses of action open. I knew I
might disagree with much that
went on at SRI—but I had to
express my personal disgust with
the Trustees' decision. All
traditional channels—my old
standbys—had failed. I decided to
go picket legally because it was
the only thing I personally could
do. But I also wanted to show my
support for the Movement.
Yes, I guess I do accept
"collective responsibility" for the
actions of the April 3 Movement
although I have always acted
legally and even spoken against
certain tactics. When I think of
the alternatives —of supporting
either openly or tacitly (by
inaction) the way things are on
this campus, at SRI, and in this
country, I realize my full support
lies behind those who want
changes which I feel are
imperative and who are willing to
act honestly (if not always wisely)
to do something about them.
Randomness Rampart
I remembered the randomness
of my "responsibilitiy" again. It
did seem peculiar . . . but not

really unique. Much of life is just
such a lottery. Some guys go to
Viet Nam, others don't . . . still
others don't return. And, who
decides which child is born in the
ghetto and which one is a
suburbanite?
Harvey had decided that I was
to be enjoined. That thought
became easier for me to accept. I
realized that I, too, held
individuals responsible for actions
of their associates and groups.
Nuremburg Trials or not the
world was wrong to let Hitler do
his thing . . . just as Americans are
wrong for failing to oppose the
inhumanity of the Viet Nam
situation.
For six weeks I have been
saying that all the campus must be
concerned (?) about research
policy. I also hold all the SRI
administrators and researchers and
staff responsible for the CBW and
counter-insurgency work which
goes on over there—no matter in
which department they personally
are involved.
Two More Injunctions
As I accept my injunction -its
randomness, illegality and all, I
issue two of my own: (1)1 enjoin
all SRI employees (John Does 1
through 3000) against all CBW
and war-related research and
against the failure to establish
their own guidelines for research
in their corporation. (2) I enjoin
all American citizens (John Does
1 through 200 million) against
failing to wake and realize what is
really wrong in this country.
The question is not "WHY
ME? but "WHY NOT
EVERYBODY?"
