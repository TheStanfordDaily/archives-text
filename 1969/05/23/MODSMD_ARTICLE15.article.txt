# Role Clarified
## Committee For New Politics 
### David W. Jones 
As a liberal political
organization found to work for
peace and racial justice
candidates, the Committee for
New Politics has undergone a
crisis of identity in the last several
months.
Two months ago we deleted
the name of the Democratic Party
from our committee's appelation:
this was not a rejection of the
electoral process but of any
identification with the techniques
of Lyndon Johnson, Hubert
Humphrey, Mendel Rivers and
James Eastland. Hopefully, we
freed ourselves to work for
candidates of individual merit and
to participate in non-partisan
electoral contests.
There was a concurrent
scepticism with the present
functioning of the electoral
process: the charade of the
Chicago convention; the power
ploys of the Humphrey wing of
the party in Santa Clara county;
the mealy-mouthed verbiage of
the November campaign; the
contradictory dedication to great
societies and to "new priorities"
and the blanket endorsement of
military expenditure; the edifying
experience of precinct walking in
East Palo Alto where transiency
and disinterest meant that a
self-selected, mostly white, 20%
of the registered voters turned out
on school board election day. Add
to this a Congress which continues
to sit on its hands while Vietnam
deaths and expenditures continue.
Several members of the
committee have turned to another
alternative: direct action in
association with the April Third
Movement. Further, the
committee has been injoined by
the Superior Court of Santa Clara
County against tresspass or
disruption at SRI. The association
with SDS, the Resistance and the
Peninsula Red Guard —invidious
from an electoral if not personal
point of view—derives from my
assumption that the committee
would not object to being one of
some 12 organizations including
the AFT, the Junior Faculty
Forum and the United Christian
Ministry which joined in calling a
community-wide meeting on the
question of SRl's future relation
to the University and the content
of its research activity. In no sense
has the Committee for New
Politics, as an organization,
endorsed the tactics of the April
Third Movement.
Clarification
Because of the injunction and
because of the association of
many committee members with
the Movement, I feel it is
necessary for a clarification of the
committee's role in the political
arena: I would hope that the
committee would:
1. re-affirm our commitment
to the electoral process.
2. recognize and respect the
necessity in certain instances of
individuals committing acts of
non-violent civil disobedience.
I would like at this point to
attempt to set these principles in
what is hopefully a coherent
statement of the liberal position.
This will unfortunately have to be
a long-winded exposition, because
the issues are many and complex.
The action-oriented might easily
dismiss this as metaphysical

bullshit. I hope that it is more
than that.
The keynote would be a
restructuring of American
institutions, not just a re-ordering
of national priorities. The
Declaration of Independence held
several truths to be self-evident:
equality and the right of liberty
and justice for all. In the agrarian
world of 1776 "equal
opportunity" may have been a
meaningful i m pli men tation
concept. In 1969, it is not.
Freedom and equality and justice
can only be exercised by those
who have the organization and the
money and the food and the
education to do so. Freedom is
freedom for those who have the
power to exercise it. The mass
society militates against the
sharing of that power. Power —and
therefore freedom—rests with
institutions — corporations,
universities, the Department of
Defense. Freedom is found at the
pinacle of the hierarchy, not at its
base.
Freedom is accountability.
It is the capacity to determine
one's own actions and be
responsible for them. The draft,
the hierarchical nature of our
institutions, the ethno-centric
presumptions of our foreign
policy, the power-mediated
conclusions of our electoral
process, the property—rather than
people—orientation of our law
and law enforcement—all these
militate against the exercise of
freedom.
We re-affirm freedom based on
the power of people rather than
of hierarcies or institutions. We
call for a decision-making process
which returns to the principles of
individual integrity and the
responsibility of personal
conscience. Simply: one man, one
vote.
Idyllic
The vision if idyllic. Perhaps it
is unworkable. Perhaps it is
nostalgia for a lost, never-existant
Golden Age. Metaphysical
bullshit, but Nietzche says
progress comes from the tension
between innocence and cynicism.
The cynicism is in the analysis
of things as they are: a national
identity which presumes the
virtue of international policework,
corporate decision-mak ing,
seniority and hierarchy.
This brings us to action. What
is the Committee for New
Politics? What should it do? To
desert the electoral arena would
be folly—power rests with elected
officials and we must see that that
power is exercised for rather than
against people.
Whether or not we recognize
the legitimacy of the political
process, we must attempt to
change it from within.
Power
In this conception, politics is
both a power and a
communication process. Wo must
continue and diversify the kind of
community education campaign
that we have used with the ABM.
Military expenditure, Job Corps,
com m un i ty-sel f-determination,
low cost housing —all are subject
to the same techniques of
letter-writing, petition collecting,
fund raising and, ultimately
community organization. We have
missed too many chances to

influence the outside community
by addressing Church and
brotherhoold groups to say
nothing of unmediated, personal
contacts with Stanford dormitory
groups. Out of this
communication process comes
power —the power of consensus
and majority.
But there is a second action
possibility: direct exemplary
action as typified by the April
Third Movement.
The Committee for New
Politics has not, and I feel, should
not endorse the principle of
confrontation politics. However,
we should respect the action of
individuals, many of them our
members, who have committed
themselves to non-violent civil
disobedience.
A nsw er
Non-violent civil disobedience
precludes acts which lead to the
destruction of property or injury
to human life. It should be an
expression of the convergence of
responsibility, self-determination
and accountability. It is that
expression only when it is
non-violent and when it accepts
personal and legal consequences.
For confrontation to be
effective and morally consistent,
the participants must expect to
submit '.hemselves willingly to
judicial procedure and
prosecution by whatever
authority holds jurisdiction. How
can I justify civil disobedience and
still presume to work within the
legal and political processes?
The answer is relatively simple.
Many of this society's institutions
have political impact but are
beyond political regulation.
Corporations, universities and
other private institutions are
political bodies but they are
regulated by market
considerations. They are
responsible to economic law
rather than to the individuals
whom they act upon.
Corporations are not elected; their
policies are not responsive to
initiative, referendum or recall.
They are not moral or immoral;
they are amoral. They are
apolitical, yet they have enormous
political impact. This is the case
with Stanford's Trustees; it is the
case with SRI. They re deciding
the fate of people—sometimes
killing them—to which they are in
no way responsible or
accountable. This is an
illegitimate, if technically legal,
exercise of power.
For those social institutions
which are beyond the political
process yet influence in its
operation, a committee which
deals in electoral politics should
understand and respect the
actions of individuals who commit
acts of non-violent civil
disobedience.
But this action is only effective
when it is both an exercise of
conscience and of
communication. The public must
be informed about why this
action has been taken and it must
be given an understanding of the
non-violence of the tactic.
Hopefully out of changing
consensus there will be economic
pressures, marketplace, amoral
considerations which lead to a
change in polity criteria.
Confrontation cannot occur in

a vacuum. It must be tied to work
within the political system. One
free institution cannot exist in a
coercive society. I hope the
Committee for New Politics can
affirm its commitment to political
action within the electoral
process.
I will continue my association
with the April Third Movement.
That commitment is personal, it is
not the commitment of the
Committee for New Politics.
