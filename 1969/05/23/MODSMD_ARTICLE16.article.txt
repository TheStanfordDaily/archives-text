# Letters To The Editor
## Hope Of The World Lies In Students 
### 
Editor, THL DAILY:
I am a Research Assistant and
unofficial technical editor in the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Today 1 found in my "In" mail
box a dittoed copy of a letter
from Professor William R. Rambo
(who is chief administrator of the
Stanford Electronics
Laboratories) to Mr. Charles A.
Anderson, President, SRI. The
letter contains the following
statement:
"It is my view that the
University Community has
demonstrated an incapacity to
understand the nature and import
of certain areas of research,
particularly applied research. It is
unable, or disinclined, to provide
a suitable environment for such
research, or to accept those who
engage professionally in it. It has
also demonstrated a growing
desire, unnatural to a university,
to control such research, and on
the basis of a quite remarkable set
of political, social, and moral
precepts." (The italics are mine.)
For several thousand years man
has tried to raise himself from the
slime of animal brute force to
assert in himself some sort of
spiritual being. At least three of
the world's great religions
incorporate in their tenets the
basic "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL." These religions are
Judaism, Buddhism, and
Christianity. Remarkable!
The 6th Commandment of the
Judeo-Christian ethic does not
say: "THOU SHALT NOT KILL
EXCEPT WHEN IN UNIFORM."
The 6th Commandment does
not say: "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL EXCEPT BY
LONG-RANGE NAVAL GUNS

WHICH SPRAY NAPALM ON
WOMEN AND BABIES THOU
CANST NOT SEE."
The 6th Commandment does
not say "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL EXCEPT BY SPREADING
PLAGUE IN CIVILIAN
POPULATIONS."
It says: "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL," period.
On top of this, one of the
greatest philosophers the world
has ever known, Socrates, said in
the Crito: "... injustice is always
an evil and dishonor to him who
acts unjustly."
The hope of the world lies in
our young generation of students.
I'm for them.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In reading Christopher S.
Wren's article, "Greece:
Government by Torture," in the
May 27 issue of Look Magazine, I
was once again struck by
America's infallible knack for
supporting the most corrupt,
fascist regimes of the world.
Fanco, Batista and Diem are past
history by now. We are slowly but
surely becoming aware of our
government's commitments in
South America. But Greece, in the
minds of most, at least, remains a
vacation-land of sun, sea and
marble ruins.
The accounts of torture of
innocent victims, "intellectuals,"
"Communists" and the like
recorded by the Look article did
more than shock me. I was taken
by surprise, yes: outraged, yes.
But there was worse: that
incredible feeling of nausea in the
pit of my stomach, and that
symptomatic reaction so
characteristic of the little man in
today's society—a feeling of total
helplessness coupled with an
urgent need to "do something."
That America fought against
similar crimes perpetrated by the
Nazis in World War 11, and is now,
in the name of freedom, using
exactly those tactics in Viet-nam,
is only one example of the huge
contradiction which constitutes
American Foreign Policy today.
We must not divert our criticism
from the war in Viet-nam for one
second. But we must somehow dig
new roads in our capacity to fight
the horrible injustices encouraged
by the American Government,
and make the cries of "Free
Greece" heard.
To each his own tactics. It
seems to me that the inhuman
acts of torture committed every

day in Greece are pressing enough
to warrant the attention of SDS
and even the Third World
Liberation Front, since the Greek
Junta is being supported to the
tune of approximately $40
million in American tax-payers'
money. Perhaps picketing Greek
Consulates throughout the nation
would be a way to protest. I,
personally, am writing a letter to
my Congressman. It seems the
least we all can do.

Editor, THE DAILY:
Last Saturday. Sitting in the
sun. Crunch. Gravel underfoot.
Two ladies nearby. Straight
backed, correct, softly powdered
matte profiles simply coiffed,
deferring to each other as they
chat. Low. Restrained. Cruel
elegance of summer white
unimportant cotton dresses.
Tailored. Careful gestures.
Radiant.
Tall black. Proud to be himself.
Polite manners of another era.
The soft low tones of service.
Simplicity of manner —slowly
elegant as he walks among the
tables.
Bright colors. Sport coats with
coordinaed jackets. Striped
regimental ties. Tall strides. Dark
glasses. Memories of Venetian
decadence. Swarming up the

plaza. Rich beyond hungery. New.
Shiny women. Bright lipstick. Set
hair. Wearily old yet young.
Caring deeply. Proud to have
made it. Twenty-five years after.
Returning.
Children of a class. Born to
success. Enraged, glorious youth.
Health. Unhappiness of being
everything important. A future
planned. Predictable. Unsure yet
arrogant. Looking for love.
Unable to accept that close at
hand. Ideals brutally intent.
Flaunting their suffering,
sometimes. A cry of pain stifled
by maturity.

Today 1 found in my "In" mail
box a dittoed copy of a letter
from Professor William R. Rambo
(who is chief administrator of the
Stanford Electronics
Laboratories) to Mr. Charles A.
Anderson, President, SRI. The
letter contains the following
statement:
"It is my view that the
University Community has
demonstrated an incapacity to
understand the nature and import
of certain areas of research,
particularly applied research. It is
unable, or disinclined, to provide
a suitable environment for such
research, or to accept those who
engage professionally in it. It has
also demonstrated a growing
desire, unnatural to a university,
to control such research, and on
the basis of a quite remarkable set
of political, social, and moral
precepts." (The italics are mine.)
For several thousand years man
has tried to raise himself from the
slime of animal brute force to
assert in himself some sort of
spiritual being. At least three of
the world's great religions
incorporate in their tenets the
basic "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL." These religions are
Judaism, Buddhism, and
Christianity. Remarkable!
The 6th Commandment of the
Judeo-Christian ethic does not
say: "THOU SHALT NOT KILL
EXCEPT WHEN IN UNIFORM."
The 6th Commandment does
not say: "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL EXCEPT BY
LONG-RANGE NAVAL GUNS

WHICH SPRAY NAPALM ON
WOMEN AND BABIES THOU
CANST NOT SEE."
The 6th Commandment does
not say "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL EXCEPT BY SPREADING
PLAGUE IN CIVILIAN
POPULATIONS."
It says: "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL," period.
On top of this, one of the
greatest philosophers the world
has ever known, Socrates, said in
the Crito: "... injustice is always
an evil and dishonor to him who
acts unjustly."
The hope of the world lies in
our young generation of students.

In reading Christopher S.
Wren's article, "Greece:
Government by Torture," in the
May 27 issue of Look Magazine, I
was once again struck by
America's infallible knack for
supporting the most corrupt,
fascist regimes of the world.
Fanco, Batista and Diem are past
history by now. We are slowly but
surely becoming aware of our
government's commitments in
South America. But Greece, in the
minds of most, at least, remains a
vacation-land of sun, sea and
marble ruins.
The accounts of torture of
innocent victims, "intellectuals,"
"Communists" and the like
recorded by the Look article did
more than shock me. I was taken
by surprise, yes: outraged, yes.
But there was worse: that
incredible feeling of nausea in the
pit of my stomach, and that
symptomatic reaction so
characteristic of the little man in
today's society—a feeling of total
helplessness coupled with an
urgent need to "do something."
That America fought against
similar crimes perpetrated by the
Nazis in World War 11, and is now,
in the name of freedom, using
exactly those tactics in Viet-nam,
is only one example of the huge
contradiction which constitutes
American Foreign Policy today.
We must not divert our criticism
from the war in Viet-nam for one
second. But we must somehow dig
new roads in our capacity to fight
the horrible injustices encouraged
by the American Government,
and make the cries of "Free
Greece" heard.

Editor, THE DAILY:
In reading Christopher S.
Wren's article, "Greece:
Government by Torture," in the
May 27 issue of Look Magazine, I
was once again struck by
America's infallible knack for
supporting the most corrupt,
fascist regimes of the world.
Fanco, Batista and Diem are past
history by now. We are slowly but
surely becoming aware of our
government's commitments in
South America. But Greece, in the
minds of most, at least, remains a
vacation-land of sun, sea and
marble ruins.
The accounts of torture of
innocent victims, "intellectuals,"
"Communists" and the like
recorded by the Look article did
more than shock me. I was taken
by surprise, yes: outraged, yes.
But there was worse: that
incredible feeling of nausea in the
pit of my stomach, and that
symptomatic reaction so
characteristic of the little man in
today's society—a feeling of total
helplessness coupled with an
urgent need to "do something."
That America fought against
similar crimes perpetrated by the
Nazis in World War 11, and is now,
in the name of freedom, using
exactly those tactics in Viet-nam,
is only one example of the huge
contradiction which constitutes
American Foreign Policy today.
We must not divert our criticism
from the war in Viet-nam for one
second. But we must somehow dig
new roads in our capacity to fight
the horrible injustices encouraged
by the American Government,
and make the cries of "Free
Greece" heard.
To each his own tactics. It
seems to me that the inhuman
acts of torture committed every

day in Greece are pressing enough
to warrant the attention of SDS
and even the Third World
Liberation Front, since the Greek
Junta is being supported to the
tune of approximately $40
million in American tax-payers'
money. Perhaps picketing Greek
Consulates throughout the nation
would be a way to protest. I,
personally, am writing a letter to
my Congressman. It seems the
least we all can do.

Last Saturday. Sitting in the
sun. Crunch. Gravel underfoot.
Two ladies nearby. Straight
backed, correct, softly powdered
matte profiles simply coiffed,
deferring to each other as they
chat. Low. Restrained. Cruel
elegance of summer white
unimportant cotton dresses.
Tailored. Careful gestures.
Radiant.
Tall black. Proud to be himself.
Polite manners of another era.
The soft low tones of service.
Simplicity of manner —slowly
elegant as he walks among the
tables.
Bright colors. Sport coats with
coordinaed jackets. Striped
regimental ties. Tall strides. Dark
glasses. Memories of Venetian
decadence. Swarming up the

plaza. Rich beyond hungery. New.
Shiny women. Bright lipstick. Set
hair. Wearily old yet young.
Caring deeply. Proud to have
made it. Twenty-five years after.
Returning.
Children of a class. Born to
success. Enraged, glorious youth.
Health. Unhappiness of being
everything important. A future
planned. Predictable. Unsure yet
arrogant. Looking for love.
Unable to accept that close at
hand. Ideals brutally intent.
Flaunting their suffering,
sometimes. A cry of pain stifled
by maturity.

I am a Research Assistant and
unofficial technical editor in the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories.
Today 1 found in my "In" mail
box a dittoed copy of a letter
from Professor William R. Rambo
(who is chief administrator of the
Stanford Electronics
Laboratories) to Mr. Charles A.
Anderson, President, SRI. The
letter contains the following
statement:
"It is my view that the
University Community has
demonstrated an incapacity to
understand the nature and import
of certain areas of research,
particularly applied research. It is
unable, or disinclined, to provide
a suitable environment for such
research, or to accept those who
engage professionally in it. It has
also demonstrated a growing
desire, unnatural to a university,
to control such research, and on
the basis of a quite remarkable set
of political, social, and moral
precepts." (The italics are mine.)
For several thousand years man
has tried to raise himself from the
slime of animal brute force to
assert in himself some sort of
spiritual being. At least three of
the world's great religions
incorporate in their tenets the
basic "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL." These religions are
Judaism, Buddhism, and
Christianity. Remarkable!
The 6th Commandment of the
Judeo-Christian ethic does not
say: "THOU SHALT NOT KILL
EXCEPT WHEN IN UNIFORM."
The 6th Commandment does
not say: "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL EXCEPT BY
LONG-RANGE NAVAL GUNS

WHICH SPRAY NAPALM ON
WOMEN AND BABIES THOU
CANST NOT SEE."
The 6th Commandment does
not say "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL EXCEPT BY SPREADING
PLAGUE IN CIVILIAN
POPULATIONS."
It says: "THOU SHALT NOT
KILL," period.
On top of this, one of the
