## ‘I Won't Vote For A Nigger For Mayor Of LA' 
### Jan Charles Gray 
Last weekend a small but
dedicated group of Berkeley
students heard this reply from
several of the more enlightened
citizens of our Southern
Metropolis. More than a month
ago I also heard this terse
verbiage. I had asked a co-worker
why he wouldn't vote for Tom

Bradley, City Councilman, for
Mayor.
Bradley is far and away the
most qualified, articulate and
sensible candidate. He prefers to
talk about the issues, while his
opponent, incumbent Mayor Sam
Yorty is content to fill the air
waves with racist blurbs and
ephithets about the future of Los
Angeles under a Bradley
"scourge."
But Bradley has one thing
going against him—he's Black.
A six year member of the City
Council, Bradley led Yorty in the
April Ist primary by a sizeable
margin; 42% to 26% (Alphonso
Bell 15%, Baxter Ward 14%).

Bradley's 16% lead has recently
been eroding. Although a poll
released May 12th showed
Bradley still holding the same 16%
margin (53%-37%), a tele-vote
conducted last Friday showed
Yorty in the lead until a final
burst of Bradley call-in strength
put the race dead even.
Despite the fact that Alphonso
Bell (third in the primary)
endorsed Bradley immediately
and enthusiastically, as have
scores of national state and local
leaders of both parties—Yorty
stock still has shown an upward
trend. Perhaps a recent Los
Angeles Times Editorial, "Ugliness
in the Mayor's Race," was

accurate when it pointed out
". . . in politics, if you repeat a
false charge often enough, it gains
bogus validity in certain
uninformed quarters like the
glitter of fake jewelry."
Yorty's campaign seems to be
on the upbeat! There is no depth
to which the Mayor will not go. If
he can emerge from the brine with
a fresh "charge of allegation"
against Bradley—and, as he puts it
"the forces that control him."
"The Scarlet Pimpernal"
Los Angeles, as all of us that
have lived there most of our lives
know, is a strange and dangerous,
yet interesting place. One of the
most amusing side show
attractions down South is a freak
newsman named George Putnam.
Putnam does the local news and
fancies himself the Scarlet
Pimpernal of Orange County. He
alights from Channel 5 every night
as a plumed White Knight, whose
destiny is to spread the message of
truth in laugh-packed thirty
minute dosages and then dart
back to spawn more lies and
distortions in his Orange County
mecca.
Everyone knows that Putnam
couldn't get a job newscasting
anywhere but Los Angeles,
Birmingham, Alabama, or
Jacksonville, Mississippi.
Last Friday's newscast was
especially funny. He paused for a
moment and then in his somewhat
ominous and deeply reflective
(and I use the word advisedly)
voice, he chided: "Now I have an
important announcement (pause,
but no commercial) SDS'ers (raise
eyebrows) from Berkeley, invited
by local left wingers, are coming
to Los Angeles to work for
Bradley!" (look straight at all
those fellow John Birchers and
White Citizens Council members
and GRIN.)
Yorty Charges
On Saturday the Los Angeles
Times reported that Yorty warned
a group from the Women's
Christian Temperatance Union
that, "The same type of people
who have tried to take over the
campuses are in the campaign to

try and take over our city. And
we're going to have to protect our
city or we can become a big
camDus . .
The Times news story went on
to say, ". . . . Later, Yorty issued
a statement quoting an article in
the Daily Californian, the campus
newspaper at UC Berkeley, as
saying that car pools would be
arranged the next two week ends
to take students to Los Angeles to
do precinct work for Bradley.
"The major claims that these
students would be members of the
Students for a Democratic
Society, Black Students Union,
Radical Students Union and the
Third World Liberation Front.
"With these people in the act,
he said, "the citizens of Los
Angeles can expect anything to
happen."
Yorty's statements about the
SDS, BSU, RSU, TWLF trying to
wreck L.A. are, of course,
false—that goes without saying.
They are nonetheless indicative of
a campaign in which Yorty has
taken the opportunity to blame
everything but the "possibility of
an earthquake," on Bradley—and
even that charge is probably being
drafted at this very moment by
his expert political analysts.
Yorty's other stances have been
typical of this style.
Yorty's Issues
RACISM—ApriI 1, election eve,
Yorty charged over local TV that
Bradley had conducted a "racist
campaign."
POLICE —Early on, Yorty
charged that Bradley's election
would cause mass resignations on
the police force. You see, Bradley,
a former LA Police Lieutenant
and veteran of 21 years service
was somehow "anti-police." When
Police Chief Reddin resigned to
take a $70,000 leap in pay as a
newscaster—and hopefully a
simultaneous jump in his future
political career—Yorty said—this
was only "the beginning." In fact
Reddin completely denied the
charge—and the LA Times ran an
editorial unmasking Yorty's
baseless tactics.
COMMUNISM—Y orty has
charged that Tom Bradley has
been endorsed by the Communist

Party, including its President Gus
Hall and active member Dorothy
Healy.
Yorty said, "They (the
Communist Party) are supporting
him and I think it's a very
interesting combination." Yorty
failed to bring out that the
Communist Party and the People's
World (Socialist Labor Party)
supported him in 1936 as "the
candidate" in a State Assembly
contest that Yorty won.
POLICE AG AlN—When a
group of retired former officers
formed an organization to help
Bradley, Yorty attacked Bradley
because of his attempts "to take
advantage of police officers to
further his political career."
FORTAS—When Abe Fortas
resigned last week, Yorty
immediately stormed that
"... Now that we have witnessed
the problem of lawyers in public
office . . . the public has a right to
know . . . how much time Bradley
puts in at his law office and what
is this worth to him?"
Isn't in unfortunately that the
Mayor forgot to mention that he
is also a lawyer?
RACISM—When asked by a
reporter whether he thought that
race was becoming the main issue
in the campaign—as a result of
what he had been saying about
Bradley, Yorty insisted that it was
not he but Bradley who had first
brought up the race issue.
Mayor Sam declared, "He
made it an issue by his people
lining up a bloc black vote that
we've never seen before in this
city."
Facing the "Issues?"
In another interview with the
LA Times—Yorty said of Bradley,
"He's afraid to face up to the
issues except where the
statements are put out by his
press people and those writing for
him . . . What he likes to do is run
around behind my back and make
a lot of wild charges. I'll tell you
I've never seen so many wild and
irresponsible charges in any
campaign."
This Year's Award
Can there be any doubt that
this years award for the "most

facist campaign in
California-1969" goes hands down
to Sam Yorty of Los Angeles?
He also leads in another
stalwart among successful
California politicians, "Number of
times calling an opponent a
Communist in a single election,
unassisted." Further, in Yorty's
newly initiated category,
"Accusing your opponent of
Racism while being a racist
yourself," Yorty also has a
commanding lead.
Bradley, contrary to Yorty, has
tried to stay on the critical issues
that do confront Los Angeles. The
councilman has issued statements
and discussed fully Law and
Justice, Air and Water Pollution,
Finance of City Government,
Urban Pevelopment, Community
Relations and Transportation.
The Point
The Los Angeles born and bred
population at Berkeley is greater
than 30%. Isn't it about time that
the mass of students on this
campus did something
constructive for Los / ngeles, the
State—in the Berkeley name
rather than letting SDS and the
TWLF play confrontation politics
with issue after issue to the
detriment of the University, the
State and our Society—as we
stand idly by and watch it all
happen?
We all know that the UC
campus is in a state of armed
guard. It is a result of militancy
and intolerance on both sides.
Let's rise above the partisan
concerns of confrontation and go
to Los Angeles in mass- where the
"issues'* are clear—and
well-defined. There we have a
confirmed racist against a
dedicated, hard-working and
well-qualified man of conscience,
who happens to be Black.
I can speak for no one but
myself, but as for me I'm fleeing
Berkeley's surrealistic "People's
Park" scene, to plunge into
another element in a torrent of
intolerance that typifies America's
mass society today—l'm going to
LA this week end.

important announcement (pause,
but no commercial) SDS'ers (raise
eyebrows) from Berkeley, invited

those fellow John Birchers and
White Citizens Council members
and GRIN.)
Yorty Charges
On Saturday the Los Angeles
Times reported that Yorty warned
a group from the Women's
Christian Temperatance Union
that, "The same type of people
who have tried to take over the
campuses are in the campaign to

try and take over our city. And
we're going to have to protect our
city or we can become a big
camDus . .
The Times news story went on
to say, ". . . . Later, Yorty issued
a statement quoting an article in
the Daily Californian, the campus
newspaper at UC Berkeley, as
saying that car pools would be
arranged the next two week ends
to take students to Los Angeles to
do precinct work for Bradley.
"The major claims that these
students would be members of the
Students for a Democratic
Society, Black Students Union,
Radical Students Union and the
Third World Liberation Front.
"With these people in the act,
he said, "the citizens of Los
Angeles can expect anything to
happen."
Yorty's statements about the
SDS, BSU, RSU, TWLF trying to
wreck L.A. are, of course,
false—that goes without saying.
They are nonetheless indicative of
a campaign in which Yorty has
taken the opportunity to blame
everything but the "possibility of
an earthquake," on Bradley—and
even that charge is probably being
drafted at this very moment by
his expert political analysts.
Yorty's other stances have been
typical of this style.
Yorty's Issues
RACISM—ApriI 1, election eve,
Yorty charged over local TV that
Bradley had conducted a "racist
campaign."
POLICE —Early on, Yorty
charged that Bradley's election
would cause mass resignations on
the police force. You see, Bradley,
a former LA Police Lieutenant
and veteran of 21 years service
was somehow "anti-police." When
Police Chief Reddin resigned to
take a $70,000 leap in pay as a
newscaster—and hopefully a
simultaneous jump in his future
political career—Yorty said—this
was only "the beginning." In fact
Reddin completely denied the
charge—and the LA Times ran an
editorial unmasking Yorty's
baseless tactics.
COMMUNISM—Y orty has
charged that Tom Bradley has
been endorsed by the Communist

Party, including its President Gus
Hall and active member Dorothy
Healy.
Yorty said, "They (the
Communist Party) are supporting
him and I think it's a very
interesting combination." Yorty
failed to bring out that the
Communist Party and the People's
World (Socialist Labor Party)
supported him in 1936 as "the
candidate" in a State Assembly
contest that Yorty won.
POLICE AG AlN—When a
group of retired former officers
formed an organization to help
Bradley, Yorty attacked Bradley
because of his attempts "to take
advantage of police officers to
further his political career."
FORTAS—When Abe Fortas
resigned last week, Yorty
immediately stormed that
"... Now that we have witnessed
the problem of lawyers in public
office . . . the public has a right to
know . . . how much time Bradley
puts in at his law office and what
is this worth to him?"
Isn't in unfortunately that the
Mayor forgot to mention that he
is also a lawyer?
RACISM—When asked by a
reporter whether he thought that
race was becoming the main issue
in the campaign—as a result of
what he had been saying about
Bradley, Yorty insisted that it was
not he but Bradley who had first
brought up the race issue.
Mayor Sam declared, "He
made it an issue by his people
lining up a bloc black vote that
we've never seen before in this
city."
Facing the "Issues?"
In another interview with the
LA Times—Yorty said of Bradley,
"He's afraid to face up to the
issues except where the
statements are put out by his
press people and those writing for
him . . . What he likes to do is run
around behind my back and make
a lot of wild charges. I'll tell you
I've never seen so many wild and
irresponsible charges in any
campaign."
This Year's Award
Can there be any doubt that
this years award for the "most

facist campaign in
California-1969" goes hands down
to Sam Yorty of Los Angeles?
He also leads in another
stalwart among successful
California politicians, "Number of
times calling an opponent a
Communist in a single election,
unassisted." Further, in Yorty's
newly initiated category,
"Accusing your opponent of
Racism while being a racist
yourself," Yorty also has a
commanding lead.
Bradley, contrary to Yorty, has
tried to stay on the critical issues
that do confront Los Angeles. The
councilman has issued statements
and discussed fully Law and
Justice, Air and Water Pollution,
Finance of City Government,
Urban Pevelopment, Community
Relations and Transportation.
The Point
The Los Angeles born and bred
population at Berkeley is greater
than 30%. Isn't it about time that
the mass of students on this
campus did something
constructive for Los / ngeles, the
State—in the Berkeley name
rather than letting SDS and the
TWLF play confrontation politics
with issue after issue to the
detriment of the University, the
State and our Society—as we
stand idly by and watch it all
happen?
We all know that the UC
campus is in a state of armed
guard. It is a result of militancy
and intolerance on both sides.
Let's rise above the partisan
concerns of confrontation and go
to Los Angeles in mass- where the
"issues'* are clear—and
well-defined. There we have a
confirmed racist against a
dedicated, hard-working and
well-qualified man of conscience,
who happens to be Black.
I can speak for no one but
myself, but as for me I'm fleeing
Berkeley's surrealistic "People's
Park" scene, to plunge into
another element in a torrent of
intolerance that typifies America's
mass society today—l'm going to
LA this week end.
(Jan Gray is a senior economics
major at Berkeley-Ed.)
Last weekend a small but
dedicated group of Berkeley
students heard this reply from
several of the more enlightened
citizens of our Southern
Metropolis. More than a month
ago I also heard this terse
verbiage. I had asked a co-worker
why he wouldn't vote for Tom

Bradley, City Councilman, for
Mayor.
Bradley is far and away the
most qualified, articulate and
sensible candidate. He prefers to
talk about the issues, while his
opponent, incumbent Mayor Sam
Yorty is content to fill the air
waves with racist blurbs and
ephithets about the future of Los
Angeles under a Bradley
"scourge."
But Bradley has one thing
going against him—he's Black.
A six year member of the City
Council, Bradley led Yorty in the
April Ist primary by a sizeable
margin; 42% to 26% (Alphonso
Bell 15%, Baxter Ward 14%).

Bradley's 16% lead has recently
been eroding. Although a poll
released May 12th showed
Bradley still holding the same 16%
margin (53%-37%), a tele-vote
conducted last Friday showed
Yorty in the lead until a final
burst of Bradley call-in strength
put the race dead even.
Despite the fact that Alphonso
Bell (third in the primary)
endorsed Bradley immediately
and enthusiastically, as have
scores of national state and local
leaders of both parties—Yorty
stock still has shown an upward
trend. Perhaps a recent Los
Angeles Times Editorial, "Ugliness
in the Mayor's Race," was

accurate when it pointed out
". . . in politics, if you repeat a
false charge often enough, it gains
bogus validity in certain
uninformed quarters like the
glitter of fake jewelry."
Yorty's campaign seems to be
on the upbeat! There is no depth
to which the Mayor will not go. If
he can emerge from the brine with
a fresh "charge of allegation"
against Bradley—and, as he puts it
"the forces that control him."
"The Scarlet Pimpernal"
Los Angeles, as all of us that
have lived there most of our lives
know, is a strange and dangerous,
yet interesting place. One of the
most amusing side show
attractions down South is a freak
newsman named George Putnam.
Putnam does the local news and
fancies himself the Scarlet
Pimpernal of Orange County. He
alights from Channel 5 every night
as a plumed White Knight, whose
destiny is to spread the message of
truth in laugh-packed thirty
minute dosages and then dart
back to spawn more lies and
distortions in his Orange County
mecca.
Everyone knows that Putnam
couldn't get a job newscasting
anywhere but Los Angeles,
Birmingham, Alabama, or
Jacksonville, Mississippi.
Last Friday's newscast was
especially funny. He paused for a
moment and then in his somewhat
ominous and deeply reflective
(and I use the word advisedly)
voice, he chided: "Now I have an
important announcement (pause,
but no commercial) SDS'ers (raise
eyebrows) from Berkeley, invited
by local left wingers, are coming
to Los Angeles to work for
Bradley!" (look straight at all
those fellow John Birchers and

POLICE AG AlN—When a
group of retired former officers
formed an organization to help
Bradley, Yorty attacked Bradley
because of his attempts "to take
advantage of police officers to
further his political career."
FORTAS—When Abe Fortas
resigned last week, Yorty
immediately stormed that
"... Now that we have witnessed
the problem of lawyers in public
office . . . the public has a right to
know . . . how much time Bradley
puts in at his law office and what
is this worth to him?"
Isn't in unfortunately that the
Mayor forgot to mention that he
is also a lawyer?
RACISM—When asked by a
reporter whether he thought that
race was becoming the main issue
in the campaign—as a result of
what he had been saying about
Bradley, Yorty insisted that it was
not he but Bradley who had first
brought up the race issue.
Mayor Sam declared, "He
made it an issue by his people
lining up a bloc black vote that
we've never seen before in this
city."
Facing the "Issues?"
In another interview with the
LA Times—Yorty said of Bradley,
"He's afraid to face up to the
issues except where the
statements are put out by his
press people and those writing for
him . . . What he likes to do is run
around behind my back and make
a lot of wild charges. I'll tell you
I've never seen so many wild and
irresponsible charges in any
campaign."
This Year's Award
Can there be any doubt that
this years award for the "most

facist campaign in
California-1969" goes hands down
to Sam Yorty of Los Angeles?
He also leads in another
stalwart among successful
California politicians, "Number of
times calling an opponent a
Communist in a single election,
unassisted." Further, in Yorty's
newly initiated category,
"Accusing your opponent of
Racism while being a racist
yourself," Yorty also has a
commanding lead.
Bradley, contrary to Yorty, has
tried to stay on the critical issues
that do confront Los Angeles. The
councilman has issued statements
and discussed fully Law and
Justice, Air and Water Pollution,
Finance of City Government,
Urban Pevelopment, Community
Relations and Transportation.
The Point
The Los Angeles born and bred
population at Berkeley is greater
than 30%. Isn't it about time that
the mass of students on this
campus did something
constructive for Los / ngeles, the
State—in the Berkeley name
rather than letting SDS and the
TWLF play confrontation politics
with issue after issue to the
detriment of the University, the
State and our Society—as we
stand idly by and watch it all
happen?
We all know that the UC
campus is in a state of armed
guard. It is a result of militancy
and intolerance on both sides.
Let's rise above the partisan
concerns of confrontation and go
to Los Angeles in mass- where the
"issues'* are clear—and
well-defined. There we have a
confirmed racist against a
dedicated, hard-working and
well-qualified man of conscience,
who happens to be Black.
I can speak for no one but
myself, but as for me I'm fleeing
Berkeley's surrealistic "People's
Park" scene, to plunge into
another element in a torrent of
intolerance that typifies America's
mass society today—l'm going to
LA this week end.
(Jan Gray is a senior economics
major at Berkeley-Ed.)
Last weekend a small but
dedicated group of Berkeley
students heard this reply from
several of the more enlightened
citizens of our Southern
Metropolis. More than a month
ago I also heard this terse
verbiage. I had asked a co-worker
why he wouldn't vote for Tom

Bradley, City Councilman, for
Mayor.
Bradley is far and away the
most qualified, articulate and
sensible candidate. He prefers to
talk about the issues, while his
opponent, incumbent Mayor Sam
Yorty is content to fill the air
waves with racist blurbs and
ephithets about the future of Los
Angeles under a Bradley
"scourge."
But Bradley has one thing
going against him—he's Black.
A six year member of the City
Council, Bradley led Yorty in the
April Ist primary by a sizeable
margin; 42% to 26% (Alphonso
Bell 15%, Baxter Ward 14%).

Bradley's 16% lead has recently
been eroding. Although a poll
released May 12th showed
Bradley still holding the same 16%
margin (53%-37%), a tele-vote
conducted last Friday showed
Yorty in the lead until a final
burst of Bradley call-in strength
put the race dead even.
Despite the fact that Alphonso
Bell (third in the primary)
endorsed Bradley immediately
and enthusiastically, as have
scores of national state and local
leaders of both parties—Yorty
stock still has shown an upward
trend. Perhaps a recent Los
Angeles Times Editorial, "Ugliness
in the Mayor's Race," was

accurate when it pointed out
". . . in politics, if you repeat a
false charge often enough, it gains
bogus validity in certain
uninformed quarters like the
glitter of fake jewelry."
Yorty's campaign seems to be
on the upbeat! There is no depth
to which the Mayor will not go. If
he can emerge from the brine with
a fresh "charge of allegation"
against Bradley—and, as he puts it
"the forces that control him."
"The Scarlet Pimpernal"
Los Angeles, as all of us that
have lived there most of our lives
know, is a strange and dangerous,
yet interesting place. One of the
most amusing side show
attractions down South is a freak
newsman named George Putnam.
Putnam does the local news and
fancies himself the Scarlet
Pimpernal of Orange County. He
alights from Channel 5 every night
as a plumed White Knight, whose
destiny is to spread the message of
truth in laugh-packed thirty
minute dosages and then dart
back to spawn more lies and
distortions in his Orange County
mecca.
Everyone knows that Putnam
couldn't get a job newscasting
anywhere but Los Angeles,
Birmingham, Alabama, or
Jacksonville, Mississippi.
Last Friday's newscast was
especially funny. He paused for a
moment and then in his somewhat
ominous and deeply reflective
(and I use the word advisedly)
voice, he chided: "Now I have an
important announcement (pause,
but no commercial) SDS'ers (raise
eyebrows) from Berkeley, invited
by local left wingers, are coming
to Los Angeles to work for
Bradley!" (look straight at all
those fellow John Birchers and
White Citizens Council members
and GRIN.)
Yorty Charges
On Saturday the Los Angeles
Times reported that Yorty warned
a group from the Women's
Christian Temperatance Union
that, "The same type of people
who have tried to take over the
campuses are in the campaign to

try and take over our city. And
we're going to have to protect our
city or we can become a big
camDus . .
The Times news story went on
to say, ". . . . Later, Yorty issued
a statement quoting an article in
the Daily Californian, the campus
newspaper at UC Berkeley, as
saying that car pools would be
arranged the next two week ends
to take students to Los Angeles to
do precinct work for Bradley.
"The major claims that these
students would be members of the
Students for a Democratic
Society, Black Students Union,
Radical Students Union and the
Third World Liberation Front.
"With these people in the act,
he said, "the citizens of Los
Angeles can expect anything to
happen."
Yorty's statements about the
SDS, BSU, RSU, TWLF trying to
wreck L.A. are, of course,
false—that goes without saying.
They are nonetheless indicative of
a campaign in which Yorty has
taken the opportunity to blame
everything but the "possibility of
an earthquake," on Bradley—and
even that charge is probably being
drafted at this very moment by
his expert political analysts.
Yorty's other stances have been
typical of this style.
Yorty's Issues
RACISM—ApriI 1, election eve,
Yorty charged over local TV that
Bradley had conducted a "racist
campaign."
POLICE —Early on, Yorty
charged that Bradley's election
would cause mass resignations on
the police force. You see, Bradley,
a former LA Police Lieutenant
and veteran of 21 years service
was somehow "anti-police." When
Police Chief Reddin resigned to
take a $70,000 leap in pay as a
newscaster—and hopefully a
simultaneous jump in his future
political career—Yorty said—this
was only "the beginning." In fact
Reddin completely denied the
charge—and the LA Times ran an
editorial unmasking Yorty's
baseless tactics.
COMMUNISM—Y orty has
charged that Tom Bradley has
been endorsed by the Communist

Party, including its President Gus
Hall and active member Dorothy
Healy.
Yorty said, "They (the
Communist Party) are supporting
him and I think it's a very
interesting combination." Yorty
failed to bring out that the
Communist Party and the People's
World (Socialist Labor Party)
supported him in 1936 as "the
candidate" in a State Assembly
contest that Yorty won.
POLICE AG AlN—When a
group of retired former officers
formed an organization to help
Bradley, Yorty attacked Bradley
because of his attempts "to take

dedicated, hard-working and
well-qualified man of conscience,
who happens to be Black.
I can speak for no one but
myself, but as for me I'm fleeing
Berkeley's surrealistic "People's
Park" scene, to plunge into
another element in a torrent of
intolerance that typifies America's
mass society today—l'm going to
LA this week end.
(Jan Gray is a senior economics
major at Berkeley-Ed.)
Last weekend a small but
dedicated group of Berkeley
students heard this reply from
several of the more enlightened
citizens of our Southern
Metropolis. More than a month
ago I also heard this terse
verbiage. I had asked a co-worker
why he wouldn't vote for Tom

Bradley, City Councilman, for
Mayor.
Bradley is far and away the
most qualified, articulate and
sensible candidate. He prefers to
talk about the issues, while his
opponent, incumbent Mayor Sam
Yorty is content to fill the air
waves with racist blurbs and
ephithets about the future of Los
Angeles under a Bradley
"scourge."
But Bradley has one thing
going against him—he's Black.
A six year member of the City
Council, Bradley led Yorty in the
April Ist primary by a sizeable
margin; 42% to 26% (Alphonso
Bell 15%, Baxter Ward 14%).

Bradley's 16% lead has recently
been eroding. Although a poll
released May 12th showed
Bradley still holding the same 16%
margin (53%-37%), a tele-vote
conducted last Friday showed
Yorty in the lead until a final
burst of Bradley call-in strength
put the race dead even.
Despite the fact that Alphonso
Bell (third in the primary)
endorsed Bradley immediately
and enthusiastically, as have
scores of national state and local
leaders of both parties—Yorty
stock still has shown an upward
trend. Perhaps a recent Los
Angeles Times Editorial, "Ugliness
in the Mayor's Race," was

accurate when it pointed out
". . . in politics, if you repeat a
false charge often enough, it gains
bogus validity in certain
uninformed quarters like the
glitter of fake jewelry."
Yorty's campaign seems to be
on the upbeat! There is no depth
to which the Mayor will not go. If
he can emerge from the brine with
a fresh "charge of allegation"
against Bradley—and, as he puts it
"the forces that control him."
"The Scarlet Pimpernal"
Los Angeles, as all of us that
have lived there most of our lives
know, is a strange and dangerous,
yet interesting place. One of the
most amusing side show
attractions down South is a freak
newsman named George Putnam.
Putnam does the local news and
fancies himself the Scarlet
Pimpernal of Orange County. He
alights from Channel 5 every night
as a plumed White Knight, whose
destiny is to spread the message of
truth in laugh-packed thirty
minute dosages and then dart
back to spawn more lies and
distortions in his Orange County
mecca.
Everyone knows that Putnam
couldn't get a job newscasting
anywhere but Los Angeles,
Birmingham, Alabama, or
Jacksonville, Mississippi.
Last Friday's newscast was
especially funny. He paused for a
moment and then in his somewhat
ominous and deeply reflective
(and I use the word advisedly)
voice, he chided: "Now I have an
important announcement (pause,
but no commercial) SDS'ers (raise
eyebrows) from Berkeley, invited
by local left wingers, are coming
to Los Angeles to work for
Bradley!" (look straight at all
those fellow John Birchers and
White Citizens Council members
and GRIN.)
Yorty Charges
On Saturday the Los Angeles
Times reported that Yorty warned
a group from the Women's
Christian Temperatance Union
that, "The same type of people
who have tried to take over the
campuses are in the campaign to

try and take over our city. And
we're going to have to protect our
city or we can become a big
camDus . .
The Times news story went on
to say, ". . . . Later, Yorty issued
a statement quoting an article in
the Daily Californian, the campus
newspaper at UC Berkeley, as
saying that car pools would be
arranged the next two week ends
to take students to Los Angeles to
do precinct work for Bradley.
"The major claims that these
students would be members of the
Students for a Democratic
Society, Black Students Union,
Radical Students Union and the
Third World Liberation Front.
"With these people in the act,
he said, "the citizens of Los
Angeles can expect anything to
happen."
Yorty's statements about the
SDS, BSU, RSU, TWLF trying to
wreck L.A. are, of course,
false—that goes without saying.
They are nonetheless indicative of
a campaign in which Yorty has
taken the opportunity to blame
everything but the "possibility of
an earthquake," on Bradley—and
even that charge is probably being
drafted at this very moment by
his expert political analysts.
Yorty's other stances have been
typical of this style.
Yorty's Issues
RACISM—ApriI 1, election eve,
Yorty charged over local TV that
Bradley had conducted a "racist
campaign."
POLICE —Early on, Yorty
charged that Bradley's election
would cause mass resignations on
the police force. You see, Bradley,
a former LA Police Lieutenant
and veteran of 21 years service
was somehow "anti-police." When
Police Chief Reddin resigned to
take a $70,000 leap in pay as a
newscaster—and hopefully a
simultaneous jump in his future
political career—Yorty said—this
was only "the beginning." In fact
Reddin completely denied the
charge—and the LA Times ran an
editorial unmasking Yorty's
baseless tactics.
COMMUNISM—Y orty has
charged that Tom Bradley has
been endorsed by the Communist

Party, including its President Gus
Hall and active member Dorothy
Healy.
Yorty said, "They (the
Communist Party) are supporting
him and I think it's a very
interesting combination." Yorty
failed to bring out that the
Communist Party and the People's
World (Socialist Labor Party)
supported him in 1936 as "the
candidate" in a State Assembly
contest that Yorty won.
POLICE AG AlN—When a
group of retired former officers
formed an organization to help
Bradley, Yorty attacked Bradley
because of his attempts "to take
advantage of police officers to
further his political career."
FORTAS—When Abe Fortas
resigned last week, Yorty
immediately stormed that
"... Now that we have witnessed
the problem of lawyers in public
office . . . the public has a right to
know . . . how much time Bradley
puts in at his law office and what
is this worth to him?"
Isn't in unfortunately that the
Mayor forgot to mention that he
is also a lawyer?
RACISM—When asked by a
reporter whether he thought that
race was becoming the main issue
in the campaign—as a result of
what he had been saying about
Bradley, Yorty insisted that it was
not he but Bradley who had first
brought up the race issue.
Mayor Sam declared, "He
made it an issue by his people
lining up a bloc black vote that
we've never seen before in this
city."
Facing the "Issues?"
In another interview with the
LA Times—Yorty said of Bradley,
"He's afraid to face up to the
issues except where the
statements are put out by his
press people and those writing for
him . . . What he likes to do is run
around behind my back and make
a lot of wild charges. I'll tell you
I've never seen so many wild and
irresponsible charges in any
campaign."
This Year's Award
Can there be any doubt that
this years award for the "most

facist campaign in
California-1969" goes hands down
to Sam Yorty of Los Angeles?
He also leads in another
stalwart among successful
California politicians, "Number of
times calling an opponent a
Communist in a single election,
unassisted." Further, in Yorty's
newly initiated category,
"Accusing your opponent of
Racism while being a racist
yourself," Yorty also has a
commanding lead.
Bradley, contrary to Yorty, has
tried to stay on the critical issues
that do confront Los Angeles. The
councilman has issued statements
and discussed fully Law and
Justice, Air and Water Pollution,
Finance of City Government,
Urban Pevelopment, Community
Relations and Transportation.
The Point
The Los Angeles born and bred
population at Berkeley is greater
than 30%. Isn't it about time that
the mass of students on this
campus did something
constructive for Los / ngeles, the
State—in the Berkeley name
rather than letting SDS and the
TWLF play confrontation politics
with issue after issue to the
detriment of the University, the
State and our Society—as we
stand idly by and watch it all
happen?
We all know that the UC
campus is in a state of armed
guard. It is a result of militancy
and intolerance on both sides.
Let's rise above the partisan
concerns of confrontation and go
to Los Angeles in mass- where the
"issues'* are clear—and
well-defined. There we have a
confirmed racist against a
dedicated, hard-working and
well-qualified man of conscience,
who happens to be Black.
I can speak for no one but
myself, but as for me I'm fleeing
Berkeley's surrealistic "People's

distortions in his Orange County
mecca.
Everyone knows that Putnam
couldn't get a job newscasting
anywhere but Los Angeles,
Birmingham, Alabama, or
Jacksonville, Mississippi.
Last Friday's newscast was
especially funny. He paused for a
moment and then in his somewhat
ominous and deeply reflective
(and I use the word advisedly)
voice, he chided: "Now I have an
important announcement (pause,
but no commercial) SDS'ers (raise
eyebrows) from Berkeley, invited
by local left wingers, are coming
to Los Angeles to work for
Bradley!" (look straight at all
those fellow John Birchers and
White Citizens Council members
and GRIN.)
Yorty Charges
On Saturday the Los Angeles
Times reported that Yorty warned
a group from the Women's
Christian Temperatance Union
that, "The same type of people
who have tried to take over the
campuses are in the campaign to

try and take over our city. And
we're going to have to protect our
city or we can become a big
camDus . .
The Times news story went on
to say, ". . . . Later, Yorty issued
a statement quoting an article in
the Daily Californian, the campus
newspaper at UC Berkeley, as
saying that car pools would be
arranged the next two week ends
to take students to Los Angeles to
do precinct work for Bradley.
"The major claims that these
students would be members of the
Students for a Democratic
Society, Black Students Union,
Radical Students Union and the
Third World Liberation Front.
"With these people in the act,
he said, "the citizens of Los
Angeles can expect anything to
happen."
Yorty's statements about the
SDS, BSU, RSU, TWLF trying to
wreck L.A. are, of course,
false—that goes without saying.
They are nonetheless indicative of
a campaign in which Yorty has
taken the opportunity to blame
everything but the "possibility of
an earthquake," on Bradley—and
even that charge is probably being
drafted at this very moment by
his expert political analysts.
Yorty's other stances have been
typical of this style.
Yorty's Issues
RACISM—ApriI 1, election eve,
Yorty charged over local TV that
Bradley had conducted a "racist
campaign."
POLICE —Early on, Yorty
charged that Bradley's election
would cause mass resignations on
the police force. You see, Bradley,
a former LA Police Lieutenant
and veteran of 21 years service
was somehow "anti-police." When
Police Chief Reddin resigned to
take a $70,000 leap in pay as a
newscaster—and hopefully a
simultaneous jump in his future
political career—Yorty said—this
was only "the beginning." In fact
Reddin completely denied the
charge—and the LA Times ran an
editorial unmasking Yorty's
baseless tactics.
COMMUNISM—Y orty has
charged that Tom Bradley has
been endorsed by the Communist

Party, including its President Gus
Hall and active member Dorothy
Healy.
Yorty said, "They (the
Communist Party) are supporting
him and I think it's a very
interesting combination." Yorty
failed to bring out that the
Communist Party and the People's
World (Socialist Labor Party)
supported him in 1936 as "the
candidate" in a State Assembly
contest that Yorty won.
POLICE AG AlN—When a
group of retired former officers
formed an organization to help
Bradley, Yorty attacked Bradley
because of his attempts "to take
advantage of police officers to
further his political career."
FORTAS—When Abe Fortas
resigned last week, Yorty
immediately stormed that
"... Now that we have witnessed
the problem of lawyers in public
office . . . the public has a right to
know . . . how much time Bradley
puts in at his law office and what
is this worth to him?"
Isn't in unfortunately that the
Mayor forgot to mention that he
is also a lawyer?
RACISM—When asked by a
reporter whether he thought that
race was becoming the main issue
in the campaign—as a result of
what he had been saying about
Bradley, Yorty insisted that it was
not he but Bradley who had first
brought up the race issue.
Mayor Sam declared, "He
made it an issue by his people
lining up a bloc black vote that
we've never seen before in this
city."
Facing the "Issues?"
In another interview with the
LA Times—Yorty said of Bradley,
"He's afraid to face up to the
issues except where the
statements are put out by his
press people and those writing for
him . . . What he likes to do is run
around behind my back and make
a lot of wild charges. I'll tell you
I've never seen so many wild and
irresponsible charges in any
campaign."
This Year's Award
Can there be any doubt that
this years award for the "most

facist campaign in
California-1969" goes hands down
to Sam Yorty of Los Angeles?
He also leads in another
stalwart among successful
California politicians, "Number of
times calling an opponent a
Communist in a single election,
unassisted." Further, in Yorty's
newly initiated category,
"Accusing your opponent of
Racism while being a racist
yourself," Yorty also has a
commanding lead.
Bradley, contrary to Yorty, has
tried to stay on the critical issues
that do confront Los Angeles. The
councilman has issued statements
and discussed fully Law and
Justice, Air and Water Pollution,
Finance of City Government,
Urban Pevelopment, Community
Relations and Transportation.
The Point
The Los Angeles born and bred
population at Berkeley is greater
than 30%. Isn't it about time that
the mass of students on this
campus did something
constructive for Los / ngeles, the
State—in the Berkeley name
rather than letting SDS and the
TWLF play confrontation politics
with issue after issue to the
detriment of the University, the
State and our Society—as we
stand idly by and watch it all
happen?
We all know that the UC
campus is in a state of armed
guard. It is a result of militancy
and intolerance on both sides.
Let's rise above the partisan
concerns of confrontation and go
to Los Angeles in mass- where the
"issues'* are clear—and
well-defined. There we have a
confirmed racist against a
dedicated, hard-working and
well-qualified man of conscience,
who happens to be Black.
I can speak for no one but
myself, but as for me I'm fleeing
Berkeley's surrealistic "People's
Park" scene, to plunge into
another element in a torrent of
intolerance that typifies America's
mass society today—l'm going to
LA this week end.
