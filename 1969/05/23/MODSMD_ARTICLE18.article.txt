# Dear Mom
## Slippery Slippers 
### Cissie Bonini 
Dear Mom,
I have some Alpaca fur slippers
(white) and I just don't know how
to get them clean. I've broken
two combs while trying to comb
them—they won't stay still. I
don't feel I should put them in
the washing machine. Can you
help me?
Student Wife
Dear Student Wife,
I have always been a firm
believer in turning to Higher
Authority—in this case, the
S.P.C.A. What you have probably
got are two Angora cats. Angoras
are highly bred and very sensitive.
Being worn as slippers has
probably offended them and they
are reacting by losing their natural
instinct for cleanliness. The local
S.P.C.A. has an extensive library
dealing with such topics; some of
their newer titles include,
BEAGLES IN THE
AFTERNOON: GONE WITH
THE HIND: LADY
CHATTERLEY'S OTTER: SOLE
ON ICE: THE SECULAR KITTY:
VALLEY OF THE GULLS.
With deer love,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I have a lot of problems but I
hate to go to the "Round Room"
of the Chapel for help because
circles are a feminine symbol, and
a lot of the religious arguments
seem ciruclar to me. I feel that
getting caught up in that Church
wheel is just another
Merry-go-round. Angry Male
Dear A.M.,
I asked David Shilling
(Assistant to the Dean of the
Chapel) about this. He thinks
you're in a real box when you
find religion is "square." But, if
your life is checkered with
problems, he'll counsel vou in his

room at Crothers Mem—it's
rectangular.
Geometrically yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I read column religiously,
on my knees. It gives my great
inspiration. Your insight is
amazing for this age of
complexity and confusion. Is it
possible that, in this apolcalyptic
time, you are the one sent to save
us from this abomination of
desolation?
Inspired
Dear Inspired,
I find great comfort in the
Biblical admonition to "Honor
thy Mother and What's-his-name."
Mother does always know best. If
you don't believe it, ask your own
mother!
Maternally,
Mom
Dear Mom,
My girl friend works the swing
shift as an inspector of computer
parts. I go to bed at ten thirty and
leave for my embroidery class
before she gets up. What can we
do?
Sleepy
Graduate Student
Dear Sleepy,
It is obvious to me that you
have a vocation for the celibate
priesthood. God is calling to you,
probably because of the vast [
"Vestment Embroidery Problem" 1
due to the recent drop-offs in
vocations of seminary students.
This "V.E.P." situation, by the
way, is one of the underlying
issues in Cardinal Mclntyre's
efforts to get the Sacred Heart
nuns back on the needle. Bless
you, my son.

Dear Mom,
I have a lot of problems but I
hate to go to the "Round Room"
of the Chapel for help because
circles are a feminine symbol, and
a lot of the religious arguments
seem ciruclar to me. I feel that
getting caught up in that Church
wheel is just another
Merry-go-round. Angry Male
Dear A.M.,
I asked David Shilling
(Assistant to the Dean of the
Chapel) about this. He thinks
you're in a real box when you
find religion is "square." But, if
your life is checkered with
problems, he'll counsel vou in his

room at Crothers Mem—it's
rectangular.
Geometrically yours,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I read column religiously,
on my knees. It gives my great
inspiration. Your insight is
amazing for this age of
complexity and confusion. Is it
possible that, in this apolcalyptic
time, you are the one sent to save
us from this abomination of
desolation?
Inspired
Dear Inspired,
I find great comfort in the
Biblical admonition to "Honor
thy Mother and What's-his-name."
Mother does always know best. If
you don't believe it, ask your own
mother!
Maternally,
Mom
Dear Mom,
My girl friend works the swing
shift as an inspector of computer
parts. I go to bed at ten thirty and
leave for my embroidery class
before she gets up. What can we
do?
Sleepy
Graduate Student
Dear Sleepy,
It is obvious to me that you
have a vocation for the celibate
priesthood. God is calling to you,
probably because of the vast [
"Vestment Embroidery Problem" 1
due to the recent drop-offs in
vocations of seminary students.
This "V.E.P." situation, by the
way, is one of the underlying
issues in Cardinal Mclntyre's
efforts to get the Sacred Heart
nuns back on the needle. Bless
you, my son.
Sew long,
Mom
Dear Mom,
I have some Alpaca fur slippers
(white) and I just don't know how
to get them clean. I've broken
two combs while trying to comb
them—they won't stay still. I
don't feel I should put them in
the washing machine. Can you
help me?
Student Wife
Dear Student Wife,
I have always been a firm
believer in turning to Higher
Authority—in this case, the
S.P.C.A. What you have probably
got are two Angora cats. Angoras
are highly bred and very sensitive.
Being worn as slippers has
probably offended them and they
are reacting by losing their natural
instinct for cleanliness. The local
S.P.C.A. has an extensive library
dealing with such topics; some of
their newer titles include,
