# Encina Sit-In Photos Missing
## 
### 
Law Prof. Jack Friedenthal,
chairman of the Stanford Judicial
Council, reported yesterday that
students crowding in his office stole
approximately 100 photographs used to
identify participants in the May 1
occupation of Encina Hall.
Those present included the
defendants and persons represented as
giving legal defense on their behalf. He
was unable to identify the individuals
who removed the photographs.
Friedenthal was helping students find
the pictures used to identify them, as
well as the names of those who had
made the identification, when his office
became increasingly crowded.
"The photographs were freely
circulated, available to the defendants
to examine," Friedenthal said. "I
trusted people to look through them,
and to return them. I had no desire to
hide any of the pictures from any of the
defendants."
Gradually, students filled his office,
moving behind his chair, turning lights
on and off, and sitting on Friedenthal's
own papers.
When Friedenthal told one defendant
who had identified him, another
defendant said: "We'll have to take care
of that guy." Friedenthal said: "If
you're going to make that kind of
statement, you'll have to clear out of
here."
Those people who were standing
behind him, refused to move out in
front of his desk. When he turned his
face momentarily, the photographs were
passed out of his office in several
bunches through the crowd, most of
whom proceeded to leave.
They also removed the signup sheet
for a Council hearing called for next
Wednesday, saying they planned to get
more names.
"Removal of the evidence constitutes
a serious impediment to the just
resolution of cases stemming from the
Encina occupation," Friedenthal said.
Provost Richard Lyman and Dean of

Students Joel Smith released the
following statement last night:
"The theft of photographic evidence
from the office of the chairman of the
Judicial Council is disgraceful and gives
some indication of the problems the
University has in governing itself.
Despite the moralistic arguments and
appeals to the tradition of civil
disobedience, what emerges is a simple
resort to criminal acts for the purpose
of avoiding punishment."
Speaking unofficially for the A3M,
Leonard Siegel said: "If the Judicial
Council is interested in replacing the
photographs, then I'm sure that
members of the April Third Movement
would be willing to re-enact the whole
sequence of events."

"Removal of the evidence constitutes
a serious impediment to the just
resolution of cases stemming from the
Encina occupation," Friedenthal said.
Provost Richard Lyman and Dean of

Students Joel Smith released the
following statement last night:
"The theft of photographic evidence
from the office of the chairman of the
Judicial Council is disgraceful and gives
some indication of the problems the
University has in governing itself.
Despite the moralistic arguments and
appeals to the tradition of civil
disobedience, what emerges is a simple
resort to criminal acts for the purpose
of avoiding punishment."
Speaking unofficially for the A3M,
Leonard Siegel said: "If the Judicial
Council is interested in replacing the
photographs, then I'm sure that
members of the April Third Movement
would be willing to re-enact the whole
sequence of events."
