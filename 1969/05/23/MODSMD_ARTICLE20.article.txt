## Ajax Comes Alive In Frost 
### GAIL ANDERSON 
Gathering of the tribes in Frost
Amphitheatre to dance witness to
the life, death and birth of Ajax in
the aftermath of Illium. Bringing us
a tale by torchlight, exit by
starlight. Water confronted us
with American heritage in Tom
Paine, now back to the roots of
the West in Ajax 1969.
Ajax is a highly complex,
multi-level, sometimes confusing
play. Its approach to the audience
is on an intuitional and
instinctional level, and trying to
comprehend what is happening
intellectually can easily add to the
confusion. But perhaps a
sorting-out of some of these levels
may be useful.
Dilemma of Man
Sophocles' play deals with the
dilemma of man in society in the
person of Ajax. Distrusted and
disliked by the sons of Atreus, the
great hero of the Trojan war is
passed over in favor of crafty
Odysseus in the awarding of the
shield of Achilles.
Societal Pressure
Ajax, under the heavy weight
of societal pressures—especially
from his father, to whom he
cannot return unhonored—goes
made and slaughters flocks of
captive beats, thinking in his
madness that they are
Agamemnon, Menelaus and
Odysseus. Athene is the creator of
this madness, because Ajax had
scorned the gods.
Realizing he is trapped on all
sides, Ajax chooses to kill himself
on Hector's blade as a final act of
self-definition.
Yet even in death Ajax is not
allowed to be himself. His
followers wish to give him a burial

of great honor and glory;
Menelaus and Agamemnon order
that he remain unburied.
Odysseus, speaking as the voice of
reason, says the memory of Ajax's
deeds in battle will hearten the
Greeks in the light of his funeral
pyre, and the sons of Atreus
concede.
Ending in Joy
Odysses offers the shield of
Achilles to be placed on the pyre,
but Ajax's brother Teucer says the
shield would better serve leading
the Greeks. As Ajax's young son
lights the pyre, the chorus sings a
final note of joy as Ajax is finally
allowed to be a man; in this
production, he rises, unmasked
(the only such case in the play)
and naked, and walks out from
among the chorus, who follow
him out of the theatre.
Director Bob Walter and Water
ensemble have built Sophocles'
play into a complex, ritualized
performance emphasizing the
mythical, archetypal elements of
Greek theatre transformed into an
American mode. American in the
largest sense: the ritual draws on
elements of Aztec myth and
typology (as in Ajax's suicide on
the altar); the music uses
jazz-based and rhythmic-chant
structures; the use of
torch-lighting on a Greek stage
combines the strains of "Western
culture" and the culture of the
Western Hemisphere.
Yet these formal elements od
not stand out as derivative; one
does not think while observing the
play of the Aztec influence, for
example; one is simply aware that
the cohesive, distinctive mood of
the play is in some way American
without losing the connection

with Greece.
Use of Counterpoint
The complexity of
thyproduction is largely due to a
kind of contrapuntal conception
of staging. The elements of the
play —ritual, dance, music,
poetry —work together by
counterpoint rather than simple
harmonic lines, to produce a
sharply defined, distinctive mood.
Richard Geldard's beautiful
verse translation has a haunting
mood of its own that can be seen
in the opening lines:
"The white waves roll to the
black land as they have always
done. The sound is at once now
and what has gone before. Their
crack and hiss drown the cries of
men."
Or:
"The land is home
The sea is death
The line between
Men die to hold."
Ritual Celebration
Rather than repeat the moody
flow of the poetry in the other
elements of the play, Walter has
chosen to use contrast: highly
formalized, ritualistic dance
movements; earthy music and
rhythms; interspersed colloquial
sections to set off the ritual. The
result is a unique mood in ritual
celebration which is never quite
what one expects it to be.
Adding to the typological
structure of the play are masks
and mask-structures worn by the
characters. The most human of
the characters, Ajax and
Odysseus, wear ordinary masks on
their faces; the sons of Atreus
have huge structures in keeping
with their roles in the play. Walter
designed the masks superbly;
Agamemnon and Menelaus,
especially, look exactly as those
characters should look, and are
immediately identifiable.
The company, beginning with
this concept of the play, has
however encountered a number of
problems that can be summarized
as inadequate adaptation to the
environment. Frost Amphitheatre
is hard pressed to be a theatre of
any kind, and the company has
not taken this sufficiently into
consideration.
Unfocused Stage
For one thing, the square lines
of Frost and the slightly raised
stage mean there is almost no
natural focus to the stage; and to
create such a focus is nearly
impossible. Compare the shape of
a real Greek theatre to that of

Frost to see what I mean. As a
result, movement must be highly
exaggerated, which means the
pacing is inevitably slow.
Similarly, sound is easily
dissipated, and the situation is not
imporved by dozens of airplanes
passing overhead.
In a Greek theatre the
production might have been able
to hold focus; as it is, that is the
main thing wrong with this show.
The nature of the theatre works
against the audience member's
concentration on the stage.
Which is a shame. Because
some very good things are
happening in this play, only it is
hard to notice all of them. One
gets the intuitive feeling of the
play in pieces; but these pieces are
nevertheless exciting, and afford a
glimpse at whiat the play might
have been.
It is impossible to say whether
anything is drastically wrong with
the play besides the stage, since
that is such an overwhelming
force. But no one will miss the
impact of the show, even though
he may have difficulty
understanding it.

is on an intuitional and
instinctional level, and trying to
comprehend what is happening
intellectually can easily add to the
confusion. But perhaps a
sorting-out of some of these levels
may be useful.
Dilemma of Man
Sophocles' play deals with the
dilemma of man in society in the
person of Ajax. Distrusted and
disliked by the sons of Atreus, the
great hero of the Trojan war is
passed over in favor of crafty
Odysseus in the awarding of the
shield of Achilles.
Societal Pressure
Ajax, under the heavy weight
of societal pressures—especially
from his father, to whom he
cannot return unhonored—goes
made and slaughters flocks of
captive beats, thinking in his
madness that they are
Agamemnon, Menelaus and
Odysseus. Athene is the creator of
this madness, because Ajax had
scorned the gods.
Realizing he is trapped on all
sides, Ajax chooses to kill himself
on Hector's blade as a final act of
self-definition.
Yet even in death Ajax is not
allowed to be himself. His
followers wish to give him a burial

of great honor and glory;
Menelaus and Agamemnon order
that he remain unburied.
Odysseus, speaking as the voice of
reason, says the memory of Ajax's
deeds in battle will hearten the
Greeks in the light of his funeral
pyre, and the sons of Atreus
concede.
Ending in Joy
Odysses offers the shield of
Achilles to be placed on the pyre,
but Ajax's brother Teucer says the
shield would better serve leading
the Greeks. As Ajax's young son
lights the pyre, the chorus sings a
final note of joy as Ajax is finally
allowed to be a man; in this
production, he rises, unmasked
(the only such case in the play)
and naked, and walks out from
among the chorus, who follow
him out of the theatre.
Director Bob Walter and Water
ensemble have built Sophocles'
play into a complex, ritualized
performance emphasizing the
mythical, archetypal elements of
Greek theatre transformed into an
American mode. American in the
largest sense: the ritual draws on
elements of Aztec myth and
typology (as in Ajax's suicide on
the altar); the music uses
jazz-based and rhythmic-chant
structures; the use of
torch-lighting on a Greek stage
combines the strains of "Western
culture" and the culture of the
Western Hemisphere.
Yet these formal elements od
not stand out as derivative; one
does not think while observing the
play of the Aztec influence, for
example; one is simply aware that
the cohesive, distinctive mood of
the play is in some way American
without losing the connection

with Greece.
Use of Counterpoint
The complexity of
thyproduction is largely due to a
kind of contrapuntal conception
of staging. The elements of the
play —ritual, dance, music,
poetry —work together by
counterpoint rather than simple
harmonic lines, to produce a
sharply defined, distinctive mood.
Richard Geldard's beautiful
verse translation has a haunting
mood of its own that can be seen
in the opening lines:
"The white waves roll to the
black land as they have always
done. The sound is at once now
and what has gone before. Their
crack and hiss drown the cries of
men."
Or:
"The land is home
The sea is death
The line between
Men die to hold."
Ritual Celebration
Rather than repeat the moody
flow of the poetry in the other
elements of the play, Walter has
chosen to use contrast: highly
formalized, ritualistic dance
movements; earthy music and
rhythms; interspersed colloquial
sections to set off the ritual. The
result is a unique mood in ritual
celebration which is never quite
what one expects it to be.
Adding to the typological
structure of the play are masks
and mask-structures worn by the
characters. The most human of
the characters, Ajax and
Odysseus, wear ordinary masks on
their faces; the sons of Atreus
have huge structures in keeping
with their roles in the play. Walter
designed the masks superbly;
Agamemnon and Menelaus,
especially, look exactly as those
characters should look, and are
immediately identifiable.
The company, beginning with
this concept of the play, has
however encountered a number of
problems that can be summarized
as inadequate adaptation to the
environment. Frost Amphitheatre
is hard pressed to be a theatre of
any kind, and the company has
not taken this sufficiently into
consideration.
Unfocused Stage
For one thing, the square lines
of Frost and the slightly raised
stage mean there is almost no
natural focus to the stage; and to
create such a focus is nearly
impossible. Compare the shape of
a real Greek theatre to that of

Frost to see what I mean. As a
result, movement must be highly
exaggerated, which means the
pacing is inevitably slow.
Similarly, sound is easily
dissipated, and the situation is not
imporved by dozens of airplanes
passing overhead.
In a Greek theatre the
production might have been able
to hold focus; as it is, that is the
main thing wrong with this show.
The nature of the theatre works
against the audience member's
concentration on the stage.
Which is a shame. Because
some very good things are
happening in this play, only it is
hard to notice all of them. One
gets the intuitive feeling of the
play in pieces; but these pieces are
nevertheless exciting, and afford a
glimpse at whiat the play might
have been.
It is impossible to say whether
anything is drastically wrong with
the play besides the stage, since
that is such an overwhelming
force. But no one will miss the
impact of the show, even though
he may have difficulty
understanding it.

passed over in favor of crafty
Odysseus in the awarding of the
shield of Achilles.
Societal Pressure
Ajax, under the heavy weight
of societal pressures—especially
from his father, to whom he
cannot return unhonored—goes
made and slaughters flocks of
captive beats, thinking in his
madness that they are
Agamemnon, Menelaus and
Odysseus. Athene is the creator of
this madness, because Ajax had
scorned the gods.
Realizing he is trapped on all
sides, Ajax chooses to kill himself
on Hector's blade as a final act of
self-definition.
Yet even in death Ajax is not
allowed to be himself. His
followers wish to give him a burial

of great honor and glory;
Menelaus and Agamemnon order
that he remain unburied.
Odysseus, speaking as the voice of
reason, says the memory of Ajax's
deeds in battle will hearten the
Greeks in the light of his funeral
pyre, and the sons of Atreus
concede.
Ending in Joy
Odysses offers the shield of
Achilles to be placed on the pyre,
but Ajax's brother Teucer says the
shield would better serve leading
the Greeks. As Ajax's young son
lights the pyre, the chorus sings a
final note of joy as Ajax is finally
allowed to be a man; in this
production, he rises, unmasked
(the only such case in the play)
and naked, and walks out from
among the chorus, who follow
him out of the theatre.
Director Bob Walter and Water
ensemble have built Sophocles'
play into a complex, ritualized
performance emphasizing the
mythical, archetypal elements of
Greek theatre transformed into an
American mode. American in the
largest sense: the ritual draws on
elements of Aztec myth and
typology (as in Ajax's suicide on
the altar); the music uses
jazz-based and rhythmic-chant
structures; the use of
torch-lighting on a Greek stage
combines the strains of "Western
culture" and the culture of the
Western Hemisphere.
Yet these formal elements od
not stand out as derivative; one
does not think while observing the
play of the Aztec influence, for
example; one is simply aware that
the cohesive, distinctive mood of
the play is in some way American
without losing the connection

with Greece.
Use of Counterpoint
The complexity of
thyproduction is largely due to a
kind of contrapuntal conception
of staging. The elements of the
play —ritual, dance, music,
poetry —work together by
counterpoint rather than simple
harmonic lines, to produce a
sharply defined, distinctive mood.
Richard Geldard's beautiful
verse translation has a haunting
mood of its own that can be seen
in the opening lines:
"The white waves roll to the
black land as they have always
done. The sound is at once now
and what has gone before. Their
crack and hiss drown the cries of
men."
Or:
"The land is home
The sea is death
The line between
Men die to hold."
Ritual Celebration
Rather than repeat the moody
flow of the poetry in the other
elements of the play, Walter has
chosen to use contrast: highly
formalized, ritualistic dance
movements; earthy music and
rhythms; interspersed colloquial
sections to set off the ritual. The
result is a unique mood in ritual
celebration which is never quite
what one expects it to be.
Adding to the typological
structure of the play are masks
and mask-structures worn by the
characters. The most human of
the characters, Ajax and
Odysseus, wear ordinary masks on
their faces; the sons of Atreus
have huge structures in keeping
with their roles in the play. Walter
designed the masks superbly;
Agamemnon and Menelaus,
especially, look exactly as those
characters should look, and are
immediately identifiable.
The company, beginning with
this concept of the play, has
however encountered a number of
problems that can be summarized
as inadequate adaptation to the
environment. Frost Amphitheatre
is hard pressed to be a theatre of
any kind, and the company has
not taken this sufficiently into
consideration.
Unfocused Stage
For one thing, the square lines
of Frost and the slightly raised
stage mean there is almost no
natural focus to the stage; and to
create such a focus is nearly
impossible. Compare the shape of
a real Greek theatre to that of

Frost to see what I mean. As a
result, movement must be highly
exaggerated, which means the
pacing is inevitably slow.
Similarly, sound is easily
dissipated, and the situation is not
imporved by dozens of airplanes
passing overhead.
In a Greek theatre the
production might have been able
to hold focus; as it is, that is the
main thing wrong with this show.
The nature of the theatre works
against the audience member's
concentration on the stage.
Which is a shame. Because
some very good things are
happening in this play, only it is
hard to notice all of them. One
gets the intuitive feeling of the
play in pieces; but these pieces are
nevertheless exciting, and afford a
glimpse at whiat the play might
have been.
It is impossible to say whether
anything is drastically wrong with
the play besides the stage, since
that is such an overwhelming
force. But no one will miss the
impact of the show, even though
he may have difficulty
understanding it.
Ajax 1969 plays through
Saturday at 8 p.m. in Frost.
Gathering of the tribes in Frost
Amphitheatre to dance witness to
the life, death and birth of Ajax in
the aftermath of Illium. Bringing us
a tale by torchlight, exit by
starlight. Water confronted us
with American heritage in Tom
Paine, now back to the roots of
the West in Ajax 1969.
Ajax is a highly complex,
multi-level, sometimes confusing
play. Its approach to the audience
is on an intuitional and
instinctional level, and trying to
comprehend what is happening
intellectually can easily add to the
confusion. But perhaps a
sorting-out of some of these levels
may be useful.
