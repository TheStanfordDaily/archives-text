ThelUndergraduate Psychology
Club wiTt-rmnt Its mulUen rnei'tlllfcj '
"Monday afternoon at 4:15 in e2,
Cubberley. The club, which has
the support of the department
and is seeking approval from
ASSU, is the result of nearly two
years work. It all started last year
when a number of undergrads
decided that there were a lot of
changes that were needed to
improve the undergraduate
education in the department.
Actually, several committees of
the organization began
functioning before the club
became official. The Curriculum
Committee has been working
since last fall. A number of
changes have resulted from that
committee's work.
Colloquium Committee
Starting winter quarter, the
Colloquium Committee has
presented a series of bi-weekly
programs for undergraduates.
These Monday afternoon meetings
are followed by a social hour
where undergrads have a chance
to speak informally with
professors and grad students.
Both of these committees will
continue to function next year
under the official auspices of the
club. The organization also plans
to initiate some form of
communication for
undergrads—perhaps a newsletter.
Other possible projects range from
a departmental course evaluation
to an occasional departmental
"happy hour."
The Monday meeting has

several important luncuons. r irsi,
a number of changes, adopted by
the department at the urging of
the curriculum committee, will be
explained. These changes may be
important to some students for
planning their next year's
program. The meeting is also an
organizational meeting. The club's
constitution calls for a
"government by committee."
These committees will be set up at
the meeting; they will direct the
projects and activities of the club.
Steering Committee
Genera] government will bt
provided by a steering committee
consisting of representatives from
the functional committees. Tht
main function of the steering
committee is expected to bt
intra-organizatior
communication.
Seniors Worked Hard
The club's acting chairman
noted that "one of the most
unfortunate aspects of the club is
that many graduating seniors, for
example Barb Levin who started
the whole thing last year, have
worked hard to create this
organization—l hope we can dc
something with the club which
will make their work worth it."
Any students who are
interested in working on tht
club's projects or who havt
suggestions for the club, but art
unable to attend the meeting
should send their name, address
and phone number to Box 2228
Stanford.
