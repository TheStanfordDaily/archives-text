# Different Approach To Problems
## Urban Arts Foundation Established 
### 
Three Stanford faculty
members have recently created
the Urban Arts Foundation in an
attempt to "take a different
approach to urban problems."
Professors Edward Freenberg
and George Jenkins of Political
Science and Sanford Dornbusch
of Sociology say they are trying
to relate the real and the
theoretical problems of
urbanization in the United States,

Africa, Latin America and Asia by
providing jobs and establishing
workshops for aspiring urban
artists and craftsmen, and
subsidizing basic comparative
urban research at Bay Area
universities.
Jenkins commented that the
sprawl of urban problems is
reflected in the various projects
undertaken by the organization.
These range from converting

oak iceboxes into liquor cabinets
to turning gunstocks into
candlesticks. Computer graphics
are also currently on sale as are
several solid walnut tables and
stools.
Working with Urban Arts are
community groups such as
Berkeley's Ghettos, Inc., and East
Palo Alto's Nairobi Cultural
Center where Urban Arts is
striving to establish functioning
workshops.
Work currently being done by
Ghettos, Inc. for Urban Arts
includes building frames for
pictures, upholstering furniture,
and working on a mailbox for the
Law School and coffee tables for
Dean Knight of UCB.
Begun during Winter quarter
while Jenkins was at the
University of California, Urban
Arts draws its student workers
from both Stanford and Berkeley.
Depending on conflicting
activities and who is in town,
those working on Saturday's in
Jenkin's garage-workshop
fluctuate from three to a dozen.
Several students are from his
Urban Politics course, where he
regularly makes pre-class
announcements of workshop
projects.
Students thus far have built

tables, loaned a chain saw,
introduced him to two bankers
and even bought some of the
things they have made themselves.
In the garage, piled high with
lumber, several workers have
commented that the
organization desperately needs a
workshop where orders could be
received systematically and work
could proceed regularly, perhaps
on Stanford property, "where the
barbershopand the shoe shop have
good places to work."
Work starts early on Saturday
morning when cars begin to arrive
at Jenkins' home from both sides
of the bay. Coffee is put on, the
wood is moved out, the lathe and
table saw are turned on, and the
varnish cans opened.
A visitor to the workshop
immediately realizes that there is
no authoritarian structure in the
organization. Friendly arguments
about the proper shape for a
candlestick are common.
Work stops at lunch for
barbecue, beer and home-made
wine, and a discussion of future
plans and sales. Current orders are
now in the thousands of dollars.
Various organizations in the
community have given the new
group a helping hand.
The Stanford Bank provides
free banking service to the Urban

Arts Foundation. Hubbard and
Johnson are surfacing the walnut
stock, and Coldwell, Banker are
providing storage space. Kush
Manufacturing of East Palo Alto
provide uses of their bandsaw, and
Emery Barnes, director of
Vocational training of
Opportunities Industrial Center
West, consults with the group.
Barnes has directed them to
East Palo Alto printers and
truckers who provide needed
services. Urban Arts is also
establishing ties with several
groups in Watts.
Professor Jenkins is especially
anxious to hear from students and
faculty members who are working
in leather, ceramics, glass,
lithography, sculpture or other
media, who would like to
cooperate in establishing Urban
Arts on a national basis during the
summer months.
"We have a dulcimere maker
and a photographer, and we have
heard of a glass blower," he said.
"And there must be a candle
maker somewhere " Samples of
the group's work are on display in
Tresidder Memorial Union.
Inquiries about the
organization's activities and
products can be made at Jenkins
home-workshop, where an urban
seminar is planned for the summer
months, by calling 941-3516.
