# Summer Session Offers Opportunity

### 
Stanford's "Summer Visitor"
program, open to students as well
as those who just want to refresh
their intellects, has grown
increasingly popular since its
inception three years ago.
A. Berkley Driessel, assistant to
the provost and aassistant director
of Summer Session, points out
that those who are not candidates
for Stanford degrees but
nevertheless want to spend a
profitable summer in study are
welcome to apply.
Those eligible can either be
graduates or undergraduates at
other universities, graduates of
other recognized colleges or
institutions, persons over 25,
juniors in high school, or recent
high school graduates.
These students are known as
"non-matrics," short for
non-matriculated students or

those not working toward a
Stanford degree.
Summer session, Driessel
noted, is of course always open to
Stanford or other undergraduates
who wish to pick up more units
toward a bachelor's degree under
less pressure than during the
course of the normal school year.
Summer session has many
advantages, Driessel said: there are
fewer students; total enrollment
averages around 4200, as opposed
to a normal 11,500 during the
regular year. Tuition costs are
lower, classes are smaller, contacts
between faculty and students are
easier.
An analysis made by Summer
Session officials shows that in
recent years, summer visitors have
come from virtually every
American college and
university—public, private, and
church-related.
Eight-four have sent at least one
student, 40 of them at least two.
The University of Colorado,
UCLA and others in the state
system, as well as neighboring
Foothill College have sent 10 to
20 students during recent
summers.
Stanford's off-hour recreation
possibilities abound, and the
famous Stanford Summer Festival
program offers a wide variety of
cultural attractions covering the
spectrum of music, art and drama.
