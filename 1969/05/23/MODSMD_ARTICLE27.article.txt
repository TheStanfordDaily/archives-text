# Escondido Faculty Water Slated To Be Fluoridated
## 
### 
Water supplies for Escondido
Village and the faculty residential
area at Stanford will be
fluoridated, starting late this
summer, President Kenneth S.
Pitzer announced Monday.
A ballot of those affected
shows residents support the
change by a 9-to-l majority. In
all, about 5,500 persons are
involved, including those in 17
fraternities and four row houses.
Costs of about five cents per
month per living unit will be
recovered though water bills for
home owners, which were
increased Dec. 1, and through
apartment rentals.
The change was made possible
by conversion of the campus area
from a series of local water wells
to Hetch Hetchy as a supply. It
will bring the campus area in
conformance with present
practices of Palo Alto, San
Francisco, and New York City,
among others.

At President Pitzer's request,
Profs. Dale Kaiser, biochemistry,
and Charles Yanofsky, biology,
reviewed the literature on skeletal
fluorosis and allergy to fluoride
and consulted with both the
California and U.S. Public Health
Services.
"We do not see evidence of a
significant risk at this time," they
concluded, although "we do see
the possibility of a risk in the
future, particularly if the fluoride
content of food should rise to
high levels."
In November, an open forum
was held for area residents, where
fluoridation advocates and
opponents expressed their views.
Materials later circulated with the
ballots summarized pro and con
arguments.
Associate Prof. Lewis Arnow,
pharmacology, said sustained
fluoidation has resulted in an
average reduction of 60 percent in
dental caries (cavities) without a

single substantiated case of
toxicity.
Mrs. Robert Politzer, an
instructor in English, argued that
toxic effects may not show up for
a long time, that children could
receive fluorides by other direct
means, and that "the ethical,
intellectual, and economic
attainments . . .of this community
are such that mass medication is
inappropriate."
About six out of 10 living units
receiving ballots voted. Campus
homes voted 87 percent,
Escondido Village families 91
percent, Escondido Village single
student apartments 93 percent,
and fraternities and row houses
100 percent in favor of the
change.
According to Edward A.
Scoles, assistant business manager
for university housing, officers of
the State Department of Public
Health will check installation of
the fluoridation equipment.
