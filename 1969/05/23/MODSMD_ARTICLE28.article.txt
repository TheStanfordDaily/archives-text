# 20th Century Painting
## Chinese Exhibit 
### 
An exhibition of modern
Chinese painting is being held in
the Miedel Room of Stanford
Museum from May 23 to June 15,
in connection with the opening of
the Nathan Cummings Art
Building.
The art of twentieth-century
China is a vivid expression of the
creative forces at work in a great
civilization in upheaval, and a
witness to the vitality of the
Chinese artistic tradition under

stress. This exhibition, of modest
size, illustrates some of the most
successful responses of Chinese
painters, between 1910 and 1969,
to the modern world and the
challenge of the West.
Pure traditional art is presented
by Huang Pin-hung, perhaps the
last great exponent of the Wu
School of scholarly landscape
painting, and by P'u Hsin-yu, a
princely academic whose most
typical work is quite untouched

by history.
The painting of Ch'i Pai-shih
and Fu Pao-shih shows a new
vitality which is the response of
traditional art at its best, while
Chang Ta-ch'ien is a personality
too vital not to be responsive to
currents in art around him.
The twenties and thirties were
the time'of the introduction and
absorption of Western art into
China and the search for a new
style that was both modern and
Chinese. Some of the results of
this search can be seen in the
work of Lin Feng-mien, while
P'ang Hsun-ch'in illustrates both
the discovery of the Western
frontiers, and the nostalgia for a
more peaceful era, that
characterized the art of the war
years.
It might have been expected
that art in China after 1949 would
be confined to 'Socialist realism';
but, until 1966 at least, a wide
range of styles was practiced (so
long as they stopped short of
abstraction), and the work of Li
K'o-jan and Ch'eng Shih-fa shows
how successfully these painters
were able to combine freshness of
vision and technique with
acceptable content.
The rest of the exhibition is
devoted to Chinese artists in
Europe and America, Hong Kong
(chiefly the Circle Group) and
Taiwan (chiefly the Fifth Moon
Group). Their work represents the
Chinese contribution to the
international movement in
modern art.
The impact of the New York
School of the nineteen-fifties,
particularly, has stimulated
painters such as Zao Wou-ki and
Liu Kuo-sung to discover, or
rediscover, abstract expressionist
elements in their own tradition.

It might have been expected
that art in China after 1949 would
be confined to 'Socialist realism';
but, until 1966 at least, a wide
range of styles was practiced (so
long as they stopped short of
abstraction), and the work of Li
K'o-jan and Ch'eng Shih-fa shows
how successfully these painters
were able to combine freshness of
vision and technique with
acceptable content.
The rest of the exhibition is
devoted to Chinese artists in
Europe and America, Hong Kong
(chiefly the Circle Group) and
Taiwan (chiefly the Fifth Moon
Group). Their work represents the
Chinese contribution to the
international movement in
modern art.
The impact of the New York
School of the nineteen-fifties,
particularly, has stimulated
painters such as Zao Wou-ki and
Liu Kuo-sung to discover, or
rediscover, abstract expressionist
elements in their own tradition.
An exhibition of modern
Chinese painting is being held in
the Miedel Room of Stanford
Museum from May 23 to June 15,
in connection with the opening of
the Nathan Cummings Art
Building.
The art of twentieth-century
China is a vivid expression of the
creative forces at work in a great
civilization in upheaval, and a
witness to the vitality of the
Chinese artistic tradition under

stress. This exhibition, of modest
size, illustrates some of the most
successful responses of Chinese
painters, between 1910 and 1969,
to the modern world and the
challenge of the West.
Pure traditional art is presented
by Huang Pin-hung, perhaps the
last great exponent of the Wu
School of scholarly landscape
painting, and by P'u Hsin-yu, a
princely academic whose most
typical work is quite untouched

by history.
The painting of Ch'i Pai-shih
and Fu Pao-shih shows a new
vitality which is the response of
traditional art at its best, while
Chang Ta-ch'ien is a personality
too vital not to be responsive to
currents in art around him.
The twenties and thirties were
the time'of the introduction and
absorption of Western art into
China and the search for a new
style that was both modern and
Chinese. Some of the results of
this search can be seen in the
work of Lin Feng-mien, while
P'ang Hsun-ch'in illustrates both
the discovery of the Western
frontiers, and the nostalgia for a
more peaceful era, that
characterized the art of the war
years.
