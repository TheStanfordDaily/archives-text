# Company Presents Confession Drama
## 
### 
"The Devils," a play by John
Whitting, will be presented by The
Company, the undergraduate
drama group which last winter
performed "Marat-Sade", at 8
p.m., May 26-27 in the Toyon
Lounge.
A libertine priest is charged
with diabolism when lust and
hysteria possess the nuns of a
convent in 17th century France.
The priest prefers torture and
martyrdom at the hands of the
Church to confession of a crime
he did not commit.
John Whiting's drama is based
upon "The Devils of Loudun" by
Aldous Huxley. The play received
its world premiere by the Royal
Shakespeare Company in 1961.

The Company is supported by
the Dean of Students Office. The
faculty advisor is Larry
Friedlander, assistant professor of
English. The drama group was
organized two years ago as an
jutlet for Stanford
undergraduates who are

informally interested in the
theater.
To achieve a sense of
"community theater," The
Company performs many of its
productions in he student
dormitories. Also, since its
inception, the group has never
charged admission to its
performances.
"The Company removes that
special sanctity of theater and
allows a new freshness and
experimentation," said
Friedlander. "Students from
many diversified disciplines can
come together and show that
drama can happen anywhere."
"The Devils" is directed,
produced and performed entirely
by students. Bonnie Woodworth is
Director, Ken King is set designer
and producer.
Leading characters will be
played by Stephen Cramolini,
Jonathon Dedmon, William Ganz,
Mark Griffiths, Andrea Hine, Jay
Morris, Nancy Papale, and Steve
Walker.
