## Mass Berkeley Arrests 
### 
Compiled from The Daily Californian
and the Associated Press
BERKELEY—PoIice and National
Guardsmen surrounded and arrested
almost 500 People's Park supporters
parading peacefully in downtown
Berkeley yesterday.
While the 482 arrests were being
made by Berkeley Police, a roving band
of about 200 filtered through university
buildings overturning ashtrays and
breaking windows.
These demonstrators were
attempting to build support for those
arrested from students in the
classrooms. Their efforts apparently had
a negative rather than positive effect.
Yesterday's events began as a group
of about 25 faculty supporters led a
crowd of about 1000 students out to
UC's west gate where they split into

small groups and headed for downtown
Berkeley.
Police Warning
A Berkeley police squad car with a
loudspeaker warned the demonstrators
they were violating Gov. Ronald
Reagan's emergency order which
prohibits parades, rallys and marches.
The marchers were first halted and
then split by police into two groups.
The larger group of about 600 turned
around and began marching south on
Shattuck. They were kept on the
sidewalk by California Highway Patrol
and Berkeley Police cars.
The marchers entered the business
district and soon found themselves in
what was apparently a well-planned
trap. National Guard troops had closed
off all but one route of possible escape
and slowly pushed the demonstrators

into a Bank of America parking lot
surrounded by a high wall.
In the confusion, about 100 people
escaped leaving almost 500 between the
walls and the guard.
Arresl Announced
Shortly before 2 p.m. police
announced that they were all under
arrest for unlawful assembly and
blocking the street.
Surrounded by a double line of
guard, police moved in and began
making the arrests. Each person was
pulled from the lot, frisked, informed of
his rights, photographed, fingerprinted
and loaded onto one of three sheriff's
busses.
Included in this non-violent arrest
was John Hurst, associate professor of
education at UC, Robert Scheer, editor
°112 Ramparts magazine, two ministers
and at least 15 medics.
In addition to the single mass arrest
of the 482, fourteen others were
arrested in isolated incidents resulting in
a total of 496 arrests yesterday. This
brings the total number of those
arrested since the disturbances began
last Thursday to 813.
Park supporters plan to continue
their fight over the weekend. They plan
to march at 10 a.m. from Washington
School at the corner of Grove and
Bancroft tomorrow morning to
Shattuck and University Avenues.
Apollo Skims Moon
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)-Two Apollo 10 astronauts
returned safely to their command ship
Thursday after twice flying a fragile
spacecraft within 9.4 miles of the lunar
surface in man's closest approach to the
moon.
Air Force Col. Thomas P. Stafford
and Navy Cmdr. Eugene A. Cernan
guided their lunar lander module
through a complex series of rocket
firings that brought it to a rendezvous in
moon orbit with the command ship.
Stafford and Cernan brought the
cralt back together despite what ground
controllers called "wild gyrations"
shortly after the upper and lower stages
of the moon lander were separated.
The two mother ship and the moon
taxi were separated for eight hours.
During that time, Stafford and Cernan
descended to within 49,000 feet of the
moon.
Their mission was to survey a trail
lor the Apollo 1 1 moon landing in >Julv.

BERKELEY—PoIice and National
Guardsmen surrounded and arrested
almost 500 People's Park supporters
parading peacefully in downtown
Berkeley yesterday.
While the 482 arrests were being
made by Berkeley Police, a roving band
of about 200 filtered through university
buildings overturning ashtrays and
breaking windows.
These demonstrators were
attempting to build support for those
arrested from students in the
classrooms. Their efforts apparently had
a negative rather than positive effect.
Yesterday's events began as a group
of about 25 faculty supporters led a
crowd of about 1000 students out to
UC's west gate where they split into

small groups and headed for downtown
Berkeley.
Police Warning
A Berkeley police squad car with a
loudspeaker warned the demonstrators
they were violating Gov. Ronald
Reagan's emergency order which
prohibits parades, rallys and marches.
The marchers were first halted and
then split by police into two groups.
The larger group of about 600 turned
around and began marching south on
Shattuck. They were kept on the
sidewalk by California Highway Patrol
and Berkeley Police cars.
The marchers entered the business
district and soon found themselves in
what was apparently a well-planned
trap. National Guard troops had closed
off all but one route of possible escape
and slowly pushed the demonstrators

into a Bank of America parking lot
surrounded by a high wall.
In the confusion, about 100 people
escaped leaving almost 500 between the
walls and the guard.
Arresl Announced
Shortly before 2 p.m. police
announced that they were all under
arrest for unlawful assembly and
blocking the street.
Surrounded by a double line of
guard, police moved in and began
making the arrests. Each person was
pulled from the lot, frisked, informed of
his rights, photographed, fingerprinted
and loaded onto one of three sheriff's
busses.
Included in this non-violent arrest
was John Hurst, associate professor of
education at UC, Robert Scheer, editor
°112 Ramparts magazine, two ministers
and at least 15 medics.
In addition to the single mass arrest
of the 482, fourteen others were
arrested in isolated incidents resulting in
a total of 496 arrests yesterday. This
brings the total number of those
arrested since the disturbances began
last Thursday to 813.
Park supporters plan to continue
their fight over the weekend. They plan
to march at 10 a.m. from Washington
School at the corner of Grove and
Bancroft tomorrow morning to
Shattuck and University Avenues.
Apollo Skims Moon
SPACE CENTER, Houston
(AP)-Two Apollo 10 astronauts
returned safely to their command ship
Thursday after twice flying a fragile
spacecraft within 9.4 miles of the lunar
surface in man's closest approach to the
moon.
Air Force Col. Thomas P. Stafford
and Navy Cmdr. Eugene A. Cernan
guided their lunar lander module
through a complex series of rocket
firings that brought it to a rendezvous in
moon orbit with the command ship.
Stafford and Cernan brought the
cralt back together despite what ground
controllers called "wild gyrations"
shortly after the upper and lower stages
of the moon lander were separated.
