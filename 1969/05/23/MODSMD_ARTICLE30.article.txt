# BSU To Offer Trilogy
## 
### 
A trilogy of new plays by black
writers will receive their West
Coast premieres in performances
by the Black Student Union
(BSU) this month.
Johnie Scott of the BSU will
serve as executive director of the
trilogy—"The Electronic Nigger,"
"A Son Come Home," and "Ole
Judge Mose Is Dead"—which will
be presented as an evening
package at 8 p.m. May 25, 26, 28,
and 29 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
The plays are the BSU's
maiden effort at launching a
permanent Black Cultural Arts
program at Stanford, which will
draw on the wide range of talents
among the black students in all
the creative arts.
Play director is John Cochran,
former sociology instructor at San

Francisco City College, one of the
organizers of the Dialogue Black
White in the City.
He is teaching three
undergraduate special scourses in
production, beginning drama, and
makeup. These are given at "Black
House," a small bungalow just
west of Bowman Alumni House
given to the BSU for their
headquarters. The courses are
offered Tuesday and Thursday
afternoons and Wednesday nights.
"The Electronic Nigger," a
comedy by Ed Bullins, is the
major presentation of the three. It
won the Vernon Rice award for
the best off-Broadway production
of the current season.
Psychological Problems
It is set in a Southern
California junior college and deals

with psychological problems of a
highly intelligent Negro youth
named Carpentier and his teacher,
Prof. Jones.
The second Bullins play, "A
Son Come Home," deals with the
conflict between an aging mother
and a son recently released from
the Army.
The third play, by Joseph
White, is "Ole Judge Mose Is
Dead." It is set in the South and
concerns the changes which take
place in the black community
unbeknownst to the white.
Tickets for the public showing
of all three plays are on sale at
Tresidder Union box office.
