# Petition Submitted
## New Research Policy Questioned 
### 
The Academic Council announced
yesterday that it will review the decision
of its Senate on classified research next
fall. The Senate yesterday approved a
student-faculty conference committee
program strengthening written
composition for undergraduates.
The Council move came in response
to a petition signed by more than 50
members and submitted to Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler. The
April 24 Senate action, states the
petition, "has such grave consequences
for the University that it appears
desirable that it should be reviewed by
the Academic Council, after its
members have been made fully aware of

the facts upon which the decision was
based." The Senate had declared on
April 24 that "the principle of openness
in research ... is of overriding
importance."
Its guidelines affecting secret
research would permit one or more
researchers to have access to classified
information when their project would
be "significantly advanced" by this
knowledge.
Remote Relationship
But the guidelines urge that the
relationship between such information
and the project in question "be
sufficiently remote so that a member of
the research group who does not hold a
security clearance would nevertheless be
able to participate fully in all of the
intellectually significant portions of the
project.'
The petition suggests that polling of
the Council be done by written ballot
following it's next regular meeting,
scheduled for late September.
The Senate approved without dissent
recommendations as detailed in a May
22 report to the Senate and the Student
Education Council. The
recommendations:
Set a two-quarter
course-requirement in writing, to be met
through composition courses in the
English Department or authorized

courses in other departments.
Enable students demonstrating
sufficient skill in writing during the
first-quarter composition course to be
exempted from the second quarter on
certification by their instructor.
Provide for up to 25 percent of the
entering class to gain exemption from
the requirement through examination.
Ask for the establishment of a new
writing center by the appropriate
administrative officer in conjunction
with the Sub-Committee on Writing of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies to provide counseling and
tutoring in written composition on a
voluntary or referral basis for all
students.
Earlier the Senate also without
dissent, had approved education of the
writing requirement from three to two
quarters starting next fall, although the
other changes remain subject to the
creation of a committee on writing and
to funding priorities. The report of the
Conference Committee, chaired by
Speech Professor Arthur Hastings, is a
result of recommendations by the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES) and
from previous actions of the Senate and
the Student Education Council. The
Education Council earlier rejected the
course requirement while suggesting the
formation of the writing center.

Secretary H. Donald Winbigler. The
April 24 Senate action, states the
petition, "has such grave consequences
for the University that it appears
desirable that it should be reviewed by
the Academic Council, after its
members have been made fully aware of

the facts upon which the decision was
based." The Senate had declared on
April 24 that "the principle of openness
in research ... is of overriding
importance."
Its guidelines affecting secret
research would permit one or more
researchers to have access to classified
information when their project would
be "significantly advanced" by this
knowledge.
Remote Relationship
But the guidelines urge that the
relationship between such information
and the project in question "be
sufficiently remote so that a member of
the research group who does not hold a
security clearance would nevertheless be
able to participate fully in all of the
intellectually significant portions of the
project.'
The petition suggests that polling of
the Council be done by written ballot
following it's next regular meeting,
scheduled for late September.
The Senate approved without dissent
recommendations as detailed in a May
22 report to the Senate and the Student
Education Council. The
recommendations:
Set a two-quarter
course-requirement in writing, to be met
through composition courses in the
English Department or authorized

courses in other departments.
Enable students demonstrating
sufficient skill in writing during the
first-quarter composition course to be
exempted from the second quarter on
certification by their instructor.
Provide for up to 25 percent of the
entering class to gain exemption from
the requirement through examination.
Ask for the establishment of a new
writing center by the appropriate
administrative officer in conjunction
with the Sub-Committee on Writing of
the Committee on Undergraduate
Studies to provide counseling and
tutoring in written composition on a
voluntary or referral basis for all
students.
Earlier the Senate also without
dissent, had approved education of the
writing requirement from three to two
quarters starting next fall, although the
other changes remain subject to the
creation of a committee on writing and
to funding priorities. The report of the
Conference Committee, chaired by
Speech Professor Arthur Hastings, is a
result of recommendations by the Study
of Education at Stanford (SES) and
from previous actions of the Senate and
the Student Education Council. The
Education Council earlier rejected the
course requirement while suggesting the
formation of the writing center.
The Academic Council announced
yesterday that it will review the decision
of its Senate on classified research next
fall. The Senate yesterday approved a
student-faculty conference committee
program strengthening written
composition for undergraduates.
The Council move came in response
to a petition signed by more than 50
members and submitted to Academic
Secretary H. Donald Winbigler. The
April 24 Senate action, states the
