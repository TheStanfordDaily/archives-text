# A3M Continues Quiet Picketing
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
About 150 April Third Movement
demonstrators picketed peacefully in
front of Stanford Research Institute's
scarred Hanover facility for about V/ 2
hours yesterday afternoon.
A second lawful, peaceful picket is
scheduled for noon today at the Menlo
Park facility following a White Plaza
rally at 11:45.
An attempt was made late last night
to destroy the A3M dome on White
Plaza. It is reported that a girl chased
away two young men who were
attempting to kick in the base. The
dome is damaged, but is still standing.
Another meeting is scheduled for
Sunday night at 7:30, tentatively in
Cubberley Auditorium, to plan
immediate action for the Days of
Solidarity with Berkeley, next Monday
and Tuesday.
Yesterday's action came on the heels
of two days of running clashes with
police and a phone-in to SRI. These
tactics were designed to protest research
in chemical and biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, and work related to
the war in Southeast Asia. The
demonstrations are also intended to
make SRI unattractive to prospective
buyers.
The main group of demonstrators,
numbering about 35, left White Plaza at
about 12:20. Carrying protest signs they
headed toward the Hanover facility by
way of Stern and Wilbur dining halls,
encouraging others to join them.
Amazed employees stared as the group
marched through the Stern kitchen
chanting "1-2-3-4, We won't fight the
boss's war; 5-6-7-8 Organize to smash
the state!"
Although few left their lunches, the
group swelled to about 50 marchers and
followers in cars as it headed down the
southbound lane of Escondido Road
toward the industrial park.
The troup was led by a blue and
white Ford station wagon which
supplied horn honking and sporadic

Beatle music. The car was topped with
brilliantly painted panels with a large
"HI" lettered in front.
A small train of vehicles, including a
police car and a garbage truck, fell-in
somewhat accidentally behind the
demonstrators. They handed leaflets to
drivers and onlookers along the way.
At 1:00 the group joined 22
picketers already at SRI. The crowd
grew to a maximum of 150 at about
1:45. After chanting a countdown from
sixty, everyone left shortly after 2:00.
According to police, the Hanover
SRI building is almost completely
empty. SRI has been planning to vacate
the leased premises in June and has been
systematically moving out. The SRI
public relations office maintained that
the moving schedule had not been
stepped up except for those in damaged
offices.
Seven helmeted Palo Alto policemen
stood by yesterday as students carrying
signs paced on the Hanover Street and
Page Mill Road sides of the building. In
all, 17 men from the Palo Alto and
Santa Clara County police forces were
in the area.
At one point two uniformed
policemen asked a small group of
demonstrators to move from their seats
on the SRI lawn at the corner of Page
Mill and Hanover. They moved to the
curb after slight hesitation.
Another brief encounter with police
developed when demonstrators blocked
Hanover Street while on their way back
to campus shortly after 2 p.m. Hanover
and California Street traffic was delayed
briefly, but the crowd scattered out of
the street when twelve Palo Alto
policemen in three squad cars
approached with red lights flashing and
sirens blaring. No arrests were made.
A proposed phone-in designed to tie
up University lines was averted when
the phone in the Publication Board
Workroom was reconnected for use by
the A3M.

demonstrators. They handed leaflets to
drivers and onlookers along the way.
At 1:00 the group joined 22
picketers already at SRI. The crowd
grew to a maximum of 150 at about
1:45. After chanting a countdown from
sixty, everyone left shortly after 2:00.
According to police, the Hanover
SRI building is almost completely
empty. SRI has been planning to vacate
the leased premises in June and has been
systematically moving out. The SRI
public relations office maintained that
the moving schedule had not been
stepped up except for those in damaged
offices.
Seven helmeted Palo Alto policemen
stood by yesterday as students carrying
signs paced on the Hanover Street and
Page Mill Road sides of the building. In
all, 17 men from the Palo Alto and
Santa Clara County police forces were
in the area.
At one point two uniformed
policemen asked a small group of
demonstrators to move from their seats
on the SRI lawn at the corner of Page
Mill and Hanover. They moved to the
curb after slight hesitation.
Another brief encounter with police
developed when demonstrators blocked
Hanover Street while on their way back
to campus shortly after 2 p.m. Hanover
and California Street traffic was delayed
briefly, but the crowd scattered out of
the street when twelve Palo Alto
policemen in three squad cars
approached with red lights flashing and
sirens blaring. No arrests were made.
A proposed phone-in designed to tie
up University lines was averted when
the phone in the Publication Board
Workroom was reconnected for use by
the A3M.

ON THE LlNE—Members of the April Third Movement picket outside SRl's Hanover Street
facility yesterday afternoon.
About 150 April Third Movement
demonstrators picketed peacefully in
front of Stanford Research Institute's
scarred Hanover facility for about V/ 2
hours yesterday afternoon.
A second lawful, peaceful picket is
scheduled for noon today at the Menlo
Park facility following a White Plaza
rally at 11:45.
An attempt was made late last night
to destroy the A3M dome on White
Plaza. It is reported that a girl chased
away two young men who were
attempting to kick in the base. The
dome is damaged, but is still standing.
Another meeting is scheduled for
Sunday night at 7:30, tentatively in
Cubberley Auditorium, to plan
immediate action for the Days of
Solidarity with Berkeley, next Monday
and Tuesday.
Yesterday's action came on the heels
of two days of running clashes with
police and a phone-in to SRI. These
tactics were designed to protest research
in chemical and biological warfare,
counterinsurgency, and work related to
the war in Southeast Asia. The
demonstrations are also intended to
make SRI unattractive to prospective
buyers.
The main group of demonstrators,
numbering about 35, left White Plaza at
about 12:20. Carrying protest signs they
headed toward the Hanover facility by
way of Stern and Wilbur dining halls,
encouraging others to join them.
Amazed employees stared as the group
marched through the Stern kitchen
chanting "1-2-3-4, We won't fight the
boss's war; 5-6-7-8 Organize to smash
the state!"
Although few left their lunches, the
group swelled to about 50 marchers and
followers in cars as it headed down the
southbound lane of Escondido Road
toward the industrial park.
The troup was led by a blue and
white Ford station wagon which
supplied horn honking and sporadic

Beatle music. The car was topped with
brilliantly painted panels with a large
"HI" lettered in front.
A small train of vehicles, including a
police car and a garbage truck, fell-in
somewhat accidentally behind the
demonstrators. They handed leaflets to
drivers and onlookers along the way.
At 1:00 the group joined 22
picketers already at SRI. The crowd
grew to a maximum of 150 at about
