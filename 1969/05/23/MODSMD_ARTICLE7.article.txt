# LASSU Adjourns; Quorum Fails Again
## 
### DAVID DAVENPORT 
LASSU representatives were treated to a one-and-a-half hour power show at
last night's meeting, but most were not amused. The meeting was adjourned at
9:10 due to lack of a quorum, the same problem which plagued the legislature last
week.
The meeting was shut down after several members walked out, protesting
LASSU's "failure to deal with the important issues, such as a bill to call for the
resignation of the Board of Trustees," according to a leader of the dissenters.
Changes in the agenda of the meeting, which has created sharp division in the
body, sparked last night's walkout as well as the premature halt of last week's
meeting.
Activities began even before many of the legislators arrived when Speaker Yale
Braunstein and representative Paul Witt were served with the Temporary
Restraining Order, regarding disruptions at SRI, by Gilbert Diaz, a member of the
Coalition for an Academic Community.
Braunstein and Witt used the first 20 minutes of the meeting to read the
injunction, including several of the attached affadavits, and explain the
Temporary Restraining Order.
Unrest surfaced immediately as some legislators questioned the relevance of the
presentation to the LASSU meeting. Witt explained that serving the TRO before
the LASSU meeting was "clearly an attempt to intimidate a specific political
group."
He closed his speech with what ended up to be the theme of the walkout: "If
we continue with business as normal we will lose whatever bit of legitimacy we
have left. Wo must deal with the important issues."
The legislature squeezed in the passage of three bills during the quorum calls
and temporary adjournments. It approved a loan to the Photography Club,
approved the expansion of ASSU polling places from three to nine, and seated 18
new members to fill vacancies from Graduate Humanities and Sciences.
On the second quorum call, the meeting was adjourned. Among other issues,
the legislature had not yet dealt with next year's budget.
Disgruntled representatives asked when the next meeting would be held and
when the budget would be considered. Speaker Braunstein responded, "Next
Monday . . . hopefully."
