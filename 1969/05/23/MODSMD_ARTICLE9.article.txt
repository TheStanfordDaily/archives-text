# A 						First Step
## 
### 
The 1968-69 academic year is about to
pass into history. Though it may be
premature to place the April 3rd Movement
(A3M) into the scrapbook, it is not too
soon to look back on the tumultuous past
two months at Stanford and seek some
perspective.
it is obvious that the evolution of the
Movement has been toward increased
militancy and therefore diminished
support. The most recent A3M meetings
are no larger than SDS meetings and most
supporters are hard-core radicals.
To many in the Stanford community,
these latest developments prove what they
assumed from the very beginning-the
Movement embodies and is dominated by
the most radical extremist element on
campus. This conclusion logically leads to
the total dismissal of anything concerning
the A3M. It would be no small mistake if
such a dismissal were imposed across the
board.
We do not favor the tactics of violence
and anguish, and we condemn those in the
Movement who only follow the route of
major confrontation and guerilla raids.
That condemnation, however, is most
deeply felt because the tactics are hurting
people and reducing the long range
possibility of achieving certain goals.
The goals must never be forgotten and
the tactics should enhance the potential for
success. Tactics should not be the channel
for venting frustration and playing games
with police. The original goals of the A3M
remain immensely significant not only for
Stanford, but for the entire nation.
The need to halt war-related research at
Stanford and SRI hits the very gut of
critical problems in this country. For too

long Stanford has been in league with the
military-industrial complex. That phrase
has become a cliche, but the facts of the
cliche cannot be avoided. A simple walk
around campus leaves little doubt where
priorities lie at Stanford. The typical
Greyhound tour proudly points to
monuments such as the Industrial Park, the
new Space Engineering building, etc.
Stanford and SRI are key cogs in the
military effort of the United States. Recent
activities here have not been futile. When
secret research is abolished at Stanford and
when the value of SRI is reduced because it
is the center of hot controversy, the most
important men in Washington take more
than casual notice.
Once Stanford moves away from its
jealous provider at the Pentagon, perhaps
MIT will move in the same direction, and
UCLA, and Berkeley. Without the
cooperation of these mainstays of defense
research, the Pentagon will not find it so
easy to pursue wars in Asia and build up
weapon stockpiles and knowledge that go
begging for trial under fire.
The first step has been taken at
Stanford. The initiators of that step were
the many supporters of the original April
3rd Movement. It would be more than
tragic if the impetus of the first step were
lost through mindless tactics. The gains
made this Spring are major, but they will
only endure if support grows.
Once again, we plead for nonviolence
and restraint. A picket line at SRI is far
more effective than a rock through a
window. There are thousands of people at
Stanford who want to care and want to act.
Destruction makes them impotent.

Stanford and SRI are key cogs in the
military effort of the United States. Recent
activities here have not been futile. When
secret research is abolished at Stanford and
when the value of SRI is reduced because it
is the center of hot controversy, the most
important men in Washington take more
than casual notice.
Once Stanford moves away from its
jealous provider at the Pentagon, perhaps
MIT will move in the same direction, and
UCLA, and Berkeley. Without the
cooperation of these mainstays of defense
research, the Pentagon will not find it so
easy to pursue wars in Asia and build up
weapon stockpiles and knowledge that go
begging for trial under fire.
The first step has been taken at
Stanford. The initiators of that step were
the many supporters of the original April
3rd Movement. It would be more than
tragic if the impetus of the first step were
lost through mindless tactics. The gains
made this Spring are major, but they will
only endure if support grows.
Once again, we plead for nonviolence
and restraint. A picket line at SRI is far
more effective than a rock through a
window. There are thousands of people at
Stanford who want to care and want to act.
Destruction makes them impotent.
The 1968-69 academic year is about to
pass into history. Though it may be
premature to place the April 3rd Movement
(A3M) into the scrapbook, it is not too
soon to look back on the tumultuous past
two months at Stanford and seek some
perspective.
it is obvious that the evolution of the
Movement has been toward increased
militancy and therefore diminished
support. The most recent A3M meetings
are no larger than SDS meetings and most
supporters are hard-core radicals.
To many in the Stanford community,
these latest developments prove what they
assumed from the very beginning-the
Movement embodies and is dominated by
the most radical extremist element on
campus. This conclusion logically leads to
the total dismissal of anything concerning
the A3M. It would be no small mistake if
such a dismissal were imposed across the
board.
We do not favor the tactics of violence
and anguish, and we condemn those in the
Movement who only follow the route of
major confrontation and guerilla raids.
That condemnation, however, is most
deeply felt because the tactics are hurting
people and reducing the long range
possibility of achieving certain goals.
The goals must never be forgotten and
the tactics should enhance the potential for
success. Tactics should not be the channel
for venting frustration and playing games
with police. The original goals of the A3M
remain immensely significant not only for
Stanford, but for the entire nation.
The need to halt war-related research at
Stanford and SRI hits the very gut of
critical problems in this country. For too

long Stanford has been in league with the
military-industrial complex. That phrase
has become a cliche, but the facts of the
cliche cannot be avoided. A simple walk
around campus leaves little doubt where
priorities lie at Stanford. The typical
Greyhound tour proudly points to
