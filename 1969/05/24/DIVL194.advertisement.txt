Summer is
a lazy time...
... even at Stanford. Sitting under a tree, lying in
the grass—between, before, and even during
classes. The old get-up-and-go was lost some
where back in May.
But not for all of us. There are a few masochists
still slaving away, putting out a newspaper
twice a week to keep all of you informed. If you
feel that strange urge to sit down at a typewriter
even on the most beautiful California day—join
us at THE DAILY.
Come in any afternoon—we're in the Storke Stu
dent Publications Bldg., Lomita Drive between
Panama and Santa Theresa. Not everyone is
lazy.
