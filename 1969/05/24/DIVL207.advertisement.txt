■ Lafayette
§1 Is llere!
I And we thought
I you ought to know
I about it
Stanford regulars know about us, but so many
I of you come just for the summer, and perhaps
I you don't.
Lafayette stores in the Bay Area are associated
I with 240 others throughout the nation to bring
I you home electronic needs, many at wholesale
I prices.
Try us for tubes, TV and FM antennas, blank
I tape and tape recorder supplies, diamond phono
I needles, electronic books, tools, and like that.
Visit us, too, for portable phonos, small radios,
I stereo components, tape recorders — at lowest
I possible prices.
You'll like Lafayette—come see.
