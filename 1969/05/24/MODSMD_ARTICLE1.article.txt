# SES Changes Get Approval
## 
### 
Faculty and student represen
tatives have reached agreement on
the most fundamental revision in
undergraduate course require
ments in more than a decade.
Developed over the past three
years by the Study of Education
at Stanford, the new basic
requirements, effective Sept. 1,
are simply that students complete
a two-quarter course in written
composition and take a total of
three quarter's work in each of
three areas: 1) humanities and the
fine arts; 2) social sciences; and 3)
mathematics, natural sciences, and
technology.
Foreign language and the
history of Western Civilization
will be dropped as University-wide
requirements for a bachelor's
degree, although curricular
guidelines may "strongly advise"
language study and most students
probably will elect at least one
course involving historical studies.
Individual departments also may
require study in either or both of
these fields for their majors.
Still subject to refinement in
detail, the new requirements were
approved Thursday, June 5, by
the Senate of the Academic
Council in a 34-1 vote. They were
previously endorsed by the
Student Education Council, a
representative body elected to
consider SES recommendations.
Packer Headed Study
Headed by Vice Provost
Herbert L. Packer, the SES
Steering Committee expressed the
rationale for its recommendations
in these terms:
"Freedom to choose what
knowledge and what disciplines to
learn may be Stanford's greatest
gift to the student. For to choose
he must think about himself and
about the world in which he is
involved."
"And this process of thought
may contribute more to the
student's educational
development than any number of
required University courses . . .His
education is not imposed. It's his
own."
The Steering Committee
included six faculty and three
students. Its principal report on
undergraduate education was

drafted by an undergraduate.
More than 200 students, faculty
and staff participated in the
study.
The SES recommended a
substantial reduction in
University-wide requirements. It
suggested that every department
should have at least one option
for students that prescribed no
more than half their total work,
including studies outside their
major department. This
recommendation has not yet been
acted upon by either faculty or
student representatives.
Earlier this year, the Senate of
the Academic Council approved a
two-quarter requirement in
historical studies by a 17-14 vote.
This was firmly opposed by
student representatives on the
Education Council and, on
recommendation of a joint
conference committee, was
dropped in a 26-7 vote.
Conference committee
spokesmen pointed out that
history was the most popular
single major among
undergraduates and said it was
still "highly likely" that most
students would choose a course in
this field prior to graduation.
On May 8, in accord with SES
recommendations, the Senate
rejected a proposal for a
University-wide requirement of
foreign language proficiency by a
3 2-12 vote. More than 50
professors have signed a petition
requesting that the entire
Academic Council review this
decision, which it will do this fall.

requirements for a bachelor's
degree, although curricular
guidelines may "strongly advise"
language study and most students
probably will elect at least one
course involving historical studies.
Individual departments also may
require study in either or both of
these fields for their majors.
Still subject to refinement in
detail, the new requirements were
approved Thursday, June 5, by
the Senate of the Academic
Council in a 34-1 vote. They were
previously endorsed by the
Student Education Council, a
representative body elected to
consider SES recommendations.
Packer Headed Study
Headed by Vice Provost
Herbert L. Packer, the SES
Steering Committee expressed the
rationale for its recommendations
in these terms:
"Freedom to choose what
knowledge and what disciplines to
learn may be Stanford's greatest
gift to the student. For to choose
he must think about himself and
about the world in which he is
involved."
"And this process of thought
may contribute more to the
student's educational
development than any number of
required University courses . . .His
education is not imposed. It's his
own."
The Steering Committee
included six faculty and three
students. Its principal report on
undergraduate education was

drafted by an undergraduate.
More than 200 students, faculty
and staff participated in the
study.
The SES recommended a
substantial reduction in
University-wide requirements. It
suggested that every department
should have at least one option
for students that prescribed no
more than half their total work,
including studies outside their
major department. This
recommendation has not yet been
acted upon by either faculty or
student representatives.
Earlier this year, the Senate of
the Academic Council approved a
two-quarter requirement in
historical studies by a 17-14 vote.
This was firmly opposed by
student representatives on the
Education Council and, on
recommendation of a joint
conference committee, was
dropped in a 26-7 vote.
Conference committee
spokesmen pointed out that
history was the most popular
single major among
undergraduates and said it was
still "highly likely" that most
students would choose a course in
this field prior to graduation.
On May 8, in accord with SES
recommendations, the Senate
rejected a proposal for a
University-wide requirement of
foreign language proficiency by a
3 2-12 vote. More than 50
professors have signed a petition
requesting that the entire
Academic Council review this
decision, which it will do this fall.
Faculty and student represen
tatives have reached agreement on
the most fundamental revision in
undergraduate course require
ments in more than a decade.
Developed over the past three
years by the Study of Education
at Stanford, the new basic
requirements, effective Sept. 1,
are simply that students complete
a two-quarter course in written
composition and take a total of
three quarter's work in each of
three areas: 1) humanities and the
fine arts; 2) social sciences; and 3)
mathematics, natural sciences, and
technology.
Foreign language and the
history of Western Civilization
will be dropped as University-wide
requirements for a bachelor's
degree, although curricular
guidelines may "strongly advise"
language study and most students
probably will elect at least one
course involving historical studies.
