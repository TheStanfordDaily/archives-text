# Still Hope For Idealism
## 
### Willard W. Wirtz 
(The following are excerpts
from Willard Wirtz's
Commencement address.)
I know today's categorical
imperative, though, is to be
relevant—to now. It would be as
wrong to be silent at Stanford
about this year's events on the
campus as to seek sanctuary at
some little South Dakota college
to inveigh against what was called
there last week an "insurrection"
by those "intoxicated with the
romance of violent revolution."
So I have done what distance
and the press permit to learn the
facts of April and May at
Stanford, including a whole new
set of initials (SRI and AEL,
ASSU, SDS and SES, YAF, A3M)
and such a complex of cross
fertilized boards and councils and
as I think might confound a
Congressional committee if it
were to manifest a dubious
interest at the wrong time.
But I mean no diminish of the
facts, for they are that the very
meaning of a free society and of a
university are challenged
today —by a claim that
obstruction and destruction,
disdain for the law, and worst of
all, I guess, brutish contempt for
disagreement, are valid forms of
protest and dissent.
They are not. They violate
reason itself.
To the extent that such claims
create immediate crises that
require action, a stranger to the
campus, an invited guest of the
university, could comment on
only at peril to the situation and
with no conceivable possibility of
helping it.
And yet the roots of these
disruptions clearly reach, far
beyond the campus, into the
whole national community and
around the world. These remarks

proceed from the sense that
behind the campus facts of an
apparent claim of validity for
disorder, an almost universal issue
of truth—or untruth—is being
raised. This issue is whether an
almost absolutist idealism - that
totally rejects the procrastinating
counsel of experience-can be a
fair change today in the pursuit of
human purpose.
In the belief, then, that youth
demand not that we accept its
answers but only that we ask its
questions, I take a few minutes to
face the one that seems to me
most 112 u ndamental—and most
difficult. Is there basis in hard
reason and honest hope to believe
that idealism that insists on
working now has any better
chance today than it has had in
the past?
My answer is yes—on one
critical condition.
This condition is that youth
make now on the community of
the country and the world the
same kind of demands that it has
made on the colleges and
universities—and that it press
them with equal persistence.
This is a Spartan condition.
The targets for this year were
close at hand, in easy range:
research laboratories conducting
CBW (chemical-biological warfare)
experiements just a few blocks
from the dormitories; worn out
university procedures that people
just on the other side of the desk
had the authority to change.
Protagonists and antagonists alike
shared the basic commonality of a
belief in reason.
Tomorrow's objectives have to
be the malignant anachronisms of
a government that seems very far
away and held by those with
intransigent interests in the status
quo. How much will youth's spirit

wane when those as humdrum as
getting rid of the rule that permits
filibusters in the U.S. Senate;
breaking the bondage of the
seniority system and the Rules
Committee in the House of
Representatives; applying conflict
of interest rules not just to judges
but to legislators as well; mending
corrupt practices acts that are
today only fences built by foxes?
Will youth fight as hard lor
"maximum feasible participation"
by the poor in the poverty
program as it has for a black
studies curriculum?
I mean no discouragement. I
hope and believe—for the first
time —that this idealism has
muscle.
SRI is one thing. ABl\
another. Just being "against
military-industrial complex" is
only an easy catharsis unless we
go on to establish a set of
affirmative priorities. Stopping
war is at the head of youth's list.
It has to be but nothing will be
settled until this is cleared up. But
peace will be a half-victory until
its dividends are plowed back into
humanity's common enterprise.
There is iinother fundamental.
We call ours, properly, "the
civilization of the dialogue." Yet
this dialogue has become too
much a politics of poisoned
catch-phrase marshalled on
occasion by ghost-writers and read
then by statesmen from
teleprompters and that the
dialogue become a religion of
rituals that obstruct the larger
faith that reason offers; and that
the dialogue has become too
much the jargon of deceit in
which we hawk the products of
our commerce; and that the
dialogue has become the
c ojn m e rc i a 1 ized dominion
television seizes over the minds of

a people's children. Idealism will
work only if the trash is cleared
out of the channels of the
dialogue, so the truth can get
through.
One other thing about putting
idealism on an effective working
basis: idealism reflects by its very
nature the concepts of
compromise and consensus. This
means that the advocates of
change are inevitably weakened
by internal division, for they want
different things or the same things
in different ways and that is a
mistake. The custodians of inertia
face no such problem. They are
knit only out of nervousness, not
from goodwill around the
centering idea of things as they
are. So, today, those who believe
in human equality are split into
those who say "separate is not
equal" and those who demand
separatism be the measure of
equality—and the only
beneficiaries are those who don't
believe in equality at all.
Idealism will work only if
idealists—youth—will make those
compromises—not with tradition
or the Establishment, but of each
other— which the advocates of
change have to make to overcome
the monolithic inertial force of
the status quo.
Is this too large an order? I
don't know. I don't believe so. I
hope not. For I think the future
hinges and the case for idealism
depends on it utterly and entirely.

fertilized boards and councils and
as I think might confound a
Congressional committee if it
were to manifest a dubious
interest at the wrong time.
But I mean no diminish of the
facts, for they are that the very
meaning of a free society and of a
university are challenged
today —by a claim that
obstruction and destruction,
disdain for the law, and worst of
all, I guess, brutish contempt for
disagreement, are valid forms of
protest and dissent.
They are not. They violate
reason itself.
To the extent that such claims
create immediate crises that
require action, a stranger to the
campus, an invited guest of the
university, could comment on
only at peril to the situation and
with no conceivable possibility of
helping it.
And yet the roots of these
disruptions clearly reach, far
beyond the campus, into the
whole national community and
around the world. These remarks

proceed from the sense that
behind the campus facts of an
apparent claim of validity for
disorder, an almost universal issue
of truth—or untruth—is being
raised. This issue is whether an
almost absolutist idealism - that
totally rejects the procrastinating
counsel of experience-can be a
fair change today in the pursuit of
human purpose.
In the belief, then, that youth
demand not that we accept its
answers but only that we ask its
questions, I take a few minutes to
face the one that seems to me
most 112 u ndamental—and most
difficult. Is there basis in hard
reason and honest hope to believe
that idealism that insists on
working now has any better
chance today than it has had in
the past?
My answer is yes—on one
critical condition.
This condition is that youth
make now on the community of
the country and the world the
same kind of demands that it has
made on the colleges and
universities—and that it press
them with equal persistence.
This is a Spartan condition.
The targets for this year were
close at hand, in easy range:
research laboratories conducting
CBW (chemical-biological warfare)
experiements just a few blocks
from the dormitories; worn out
university procedures that people
just on the other side of the desk
had the authority to change.
Protagonists and antagonists alike
shared the basic commonality of a
belief in reason.
Tomorrow's objectives have to
be the malignant anachronisms of
a government that seems very far
away and held by those with
intransigent interests in the status
quo. How much will youth's spirit

wane when those as humdrum as
getting rid of the rule that permits
filibusters in the U.S. Senate;
breaking the bondage of the
seniority system and the Rules
Committee in the House of
Representatives; applying conflict
of interest rules not just to judges
but to legislators as well; mending
corrupt practices acts that are
today only fences built by foxes?
Will youth fight as hard lor
"maximum feasible participation"
by the poor in the poverty
program as it has for a black
studies curriculum?
I mean no discouragement. I
hope and believe—for the first
time —that this idealism has
muscle.
SRI is one thing. ABl\
another. Just being "against
military-industrial complex" is
only an easy catharsis unless we
go on to establish a set of
affirmative priorities. Stopping
war is at the head of youth's list.
It has to be but nothing will be
settled until this is cleared up. But
peace will be a half-victory until
its dividends are plowed back into
humanity's common enterprise.
There is iinother fundamental.
We call ours, properly, "the
civilization of the dialogue." Yet
this dialogue has become too
much a politics of poisoned
catch-phrase marshalled on
occasion by ghost-writers and read
then by statesmen from
teleprompters and that the
dialogue become a religion of
rituals that obstruct the larger
faith that reason offers; and that
the dialogue has become too
much the jargon of deceit in
which we hawk the products of
our commerce; and that the
dialogue has become the
c ojn m e rc i a 1 ized dominion
television seizes over the minds of

a people's children. Idealism will
work only if the trash is cleared
out of the channels of the
dialogue, so the truth can get
through.
One other thing about putting
idealism on an effective working
basis: idealism reflects by its very
nature the concepts of
compromise and consensus. This
means that the advocates of
change are inevitably weakened
by internal division, for they want
different things or the same things
in different ways and that is a
mistake. The custodians of inertia
face no such problem. They are
knit only out of nervousness, not
from goodwill around the
centering idea of things as they
are. So, today, those who believe
in human equality are split into
those who say "separate is not
equal" and those who demand
separatism be the measure of
equality—and the only
beneficiaries are those who don't
believe in equality at all.
Idealism will work only if
idealists—youth—will make those
compromises—not with tradition
or the Establishment, but of each
other— which the advocates of
change have to make to overcome
the monolithic inertial force of
the status quo.
Is this too large an order? I
don't know. I don't believe so. I
hope not. For I think the future
hinges and the case for idealism
depends on it utterly and entirely.
(The following are excerpts
from Willard Wirtz's
Commencement address.)
I know today's categorical
imperative, though, is to be
relevant—to now. It would be as
wrong to be silent at Stanford
about this year's events on the
campus as to seek sanctuary at
some little South Dakota college
to inveigh against what was called
there last week an "insurrection"
by those "intoxicated with the
romance of violent revolution."
So I have done what distance

Stanford, including a whole new

with no conceivable possibility of
helping it.
And yet the roots of these
disruptions clearly reach, far
beyond the campus, into the
whole national community and
around the world. These remarks

proceed from the sense that
behind the campus facts of an
apparent claim of validity for
disorder, an almost universal issue
of truth—or untruth—is being
raised. This issue is whether an
almost absolutist idealism - that
totally rejects the procrastinating
counsel of experience-can be a
fair change today in the pursuit of
human purpose.
In the belief, then, that youth
demand not that we accept its
answers but only that we ask its
questions, I take a few minutes to
face the one that seems to me
most 112 u ndamental—and most
difficult. Is there basis in hard
reason and honest hope to believe
that idealism that insists on
working now has any better
chance today than it has had in
the past?
My answer is yes—on one
critical condition.
This condition is that youth
make now on the community of
the country and the world the
same kind of demands that it has
made on the colleges and
universities—and that it press
them with equal persistence.
This is a Spartan condition.
The targets for this year were
close at hand, in easy range:
research laboratories conducting
CBW (chemical-biological warfare)
experiements just a few blocks
from the dormitories; worn out
university procedures that people
just on the other side of the desk
had the authority to change.
Protagonists and antagonists alike
shared the basic commonality of a
belief in reason.
Tomorrow's objectives have to
be the malignant anachronisms of
a government that seems very far
away and held by those with
intransigent interests in the status
quo. How much will youth's spirit

wane when those as humdrum as
getting rid of the rule that permits
filibusters in the U.S. Senate;
breaking the bondage of the
seniority system and the Rules
Committee in the House of
Representatives; applying conflict
of interest rules not just to judges
but to legislators as well; mending
corrupt practices acts that are
today only fences built by foxes?
Will youth fight as hard lor
"maximum feasible participation"
by the poor in the poverty
program as it has for a black
studies curriculum?
I mean no discouragement. I
hope and believe—for the first
time —that this idealism has
muscle.
SRI is one thing. ABl\
another. Just being "against
military-industrial complex" is
only an easy catharsis unless we
go on to establish a set of
affirmative priorities. Stopping
war is at the head of youth's list.
It has to be but nothing will be
settled until this is cleared up. But
peace will be a half-victory until
its dividends are plowed back into
humanity's common enterprise.
There is iinother fundamental.
We call ours, properly, "the
civilization of the dialogue." Yet
this dialogue has become too
much a politics of poisoned
catch-phrase marshalled on
occasion by ghost-writers and read
then by statesmen from
teleprompters and that the
dialogue become a religion of
rituals that obstruct the larger
faith that reason offers; and that
the dialogue has become too
much the jargon of deceit in
which we hawk the products of
our commerce; and that the
dialogue has become the
c ojn m e rc i a 1 ized dominion
television seizes over the minds of

a people's children. Idealism will
work only if the trash is cleared
out of the channels of the
dialogue, so the truth can get
through.
One other thing about putting
idealism on an effective working
basis: idealism reflects by its very
nature the concepts of
compromise and consensus. This
means that the advocates of
change are inevitably weakened
by internal division, for they want
different things or the same things
in different ways and that is a
mistake. The custodians of inertia
face no such problem. They are
knit only out of nervousness, not
from goodwill around the
centering idea of things as they
are. So, today, those who believe
in human equality are split into
those who say "separate is not
equal" and those who demand
separatism be the measure of
equality—and the only
beneficiaries are those who don't
believe in equality at all.
Idealism will work only if
idealists—youth—will make those
compromises—not with tradition
or the Establishment, but of each
other— which the advocates of
change have to make to overcome
the monolithic inertial force of
the status quo.
Is this too large an order? I
don't know. I don't believe so. I
hope not. For I think the future
hinges and the case for idealism
depends on it utterly and entirely.
(The following are excerpts
from Willard Wirtz's
Commencement address.)
I know today's categorical
imperative, though, is to be
relevant—to now. It would be as
wrong to be silent at Stanford
about this year's events on the
campus as to seek sanctuary at
some little South Dakota college
to inveigh against what was called
there last week an "insurrection"
by those "intoxicated with the
romance of violent revolution."
So I have done what distance
and the press permit to learn the
facts of April and May at
Stanford, including a whole new
set of initials (SRI and AEL,
ASSU, SDS and SES, YAF, A3M)
and such a complex of cross
fertilized boards and councils and
as I think might confound a
Congressional committee if it
were to manifest a dubious
interest at the wrong time.
But I mean no diminish of the
facts, for they are that the very
meaning of a free society and of a
university are challenged
today —by a claim that
obstruction and destruction,
disdain for the law, and worst of
all, I guess, brutish contempt for
disagreement, are valid forms of
protest and dissent.
They are not. They violate
reason itself.
To the extent that such claims
create immediate crises that
require action, a stranger to the
campus, an invited guest of the
university, could comment on
only at peril to the situation and
with no conceivable possibility of
helping it.
And yet the roots of these
