## Berkeley & SRI Revisited 
### 
Editor, The Daily:
Since a May 23 Daily article by
Michael Sweeney tried to
implicate SRI in the May 20 tear
gas spraying in Berkeley by a
National Guard helicopter, the
following facts should be noted.
Col. Andrew Wolfe, Public
Information Officer for the
National Guard, says that
helicopter used as a tear-gas
dispenser a device called a "Mark
5 riot control agent dispenser."
This device is described in detail
in Army Field Manual 19-15,
published in December, 1964. The
manual gives full instructions for
spraying crowds from a
helicopter.
This would indicate that this
device was a standard piece of
Army equipment in 1964, and
was developed at an earlier date.
Since SRl's work in
dissemination of chemical agents

began late in 1964 and ended in
1967, it seems obvious that this
particular helicopter did not make
use of any knowledge developed
at SRI.
Xerox copies of the relevant
pages from Army Field Manual
19-15 are enclosed, and Col.
Wolfe's statement can be checked
by calling him at (916) 483-6411.

Manager, Public Relations

Mr. Sweeney's reply:
My articles on May 23 and May
26 never stated that SRI
developed a particular piece of
Army hardware. Rather, I showed
that SRI worked on the
technology of disseminating tear,
a technology which is applicable
to the M-5 dispenser or any other
gadget the Army wants to use.
Homer Meaders' letter and the
accompanying xeroxed pages
from the Army field manual
actually lend important support
to the argument that SRl's
research was directly applicable to
the Berkeley atrocity. The
excerpts from the 1964 manual
describe the M-5 as large,
complicated device weighing more
than 200 lbs and occupying more
than 20 cubic feet.
It is adaptable to different
chemical agents—"so pounds of
CSI or 120 pounds of CNl"—and
has the machinery necessary to
turn the agent into an aerosol
cloud—"a pressure tank-assembly,
a hose assembly, and a pressure
regulator."
As documented in the Daily
articles, SRI worked on the
specific properties of the CS
versions of tear gas, and
experimented with CS and
simulants for CS to learn how best
to spray it out in an aerosol cloud
under pressure.
Effect On Refinements
Therefore, any refinement in
the M-5 device since 1964, or any
change in the adjustment of
pressure, nozzle characteristics or
any other parameter of the
spraying device, or any
improvement in the CS agent
itself would draw upon the
research reports which SRI
submitted to the Army between
1964 and the present (Note that
the 1964 manual mentioned
"CSI." Is there a "CS2" or
"CS3"?) SRI may well have done
work on tear gas before 1964

under an earlier CBW contract,
but they won't talk about it.
If Meaders still wants to
maintain that SRI is not
implicated in the Berkeley
helicopter gassing, he must prove
that the CS agent used at Berkeley
has not been improved since
1964, and that the M-5 device has
not been altered in components or
operation since that time.
And even if this were the case,
the fact would remain that SRI
did research expressly designed to
help the Army or National Guard
do what it did at Berkeley.
Examination Refused
The Army manual which
Meaders consulted came from the
SRI Library, according to a stamp
on one of the pages he sent the
Daily. The manual is called "Civil
Disturbances and Disasters."
Army units in the Stanford area
refused to allow the Daily to
examine a copy, but they did
reveal that the manual has been
revised since 1964. Perhaps
Meaders, with his access to
restricted government documents,
can find out for us if the revised
versions shows in detail how SRI
research was applied.
Incredibly, Meaders states 1.
his letter that "SRl's work in
dissemination of chemical agents
began late in 1964 and ended in
1967." Documentary evidence
was published in the May 26 Daily
which showed that SRI worked
on the dissemination of nerve gas
as early as 1958 and that SRI now
holds an Army CBW contract
called "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic
Powders," such as tear gas.
The Stanford community
should realize that we have no
guarantee that SRI will not
continue to do research in
chemical-biological warfare. The
SRI Board of Directors has
promised an end to research
"directly dealing with the
development of weapons" of
CBW.
That promise has no meaning,
since it will be SRI managers like
Homer Meaders who decide what
the words "directly dealing"
mean. Moreover, the Stanford
trustees have announced that they
will soon sever all ties between
Stanford and SRI. Then the SRI
Board of Directors will be free to
set any CBW research policy it
wants.

Col. Andrew Wolfe, Public
Information Officer for the
National Guard, says that
helicopter used as a tear-gas
dispenser a device called a "Mark
5 riot control agent dispenser."
This device is described in detail
in Army Field Manual 19-15,
published in December, 1964. The
manual gives full instructions for
spraying crowds from a
helicopter.
This would indicate that this
device was a standard piece of
Army equipment in 1964, and
was developed at an earlier date.
Since SRl's work in
dissemination of chemical agents

began late in 1964 and ended in
1967, it seems obvious that this
particular helicopter did not make
use of any knowledge developed
at SRI.

pages from Army Field Manual
19-15 are enclosed, and Col.
Wolfe's statement can be checked

Mr. Sweeney's reply:
My articles on May 23 and May
26 never stated that SRI
developed a particular piece of
Army hardware. Rather, I showed
that SRI worked on the
technology of disseminating tear,
a technology which is applicable
to the M-5 dispenser or any other
gadget the Army wants to use.
Homer Meaders' letter and the
accompanying xeroxed pages
from the Army field manual
actually lend important support
to the argument that SRl's
research was directly applicable to
the Berkeley atrocity. The
excerpts from the 1964 manual
describe the M-5 as large,
complicated device weighing more
than 200 lbs and occupying more
than 20 cubic feet.
It is adaptable to different
chemical agents—"so pounds of
CSI or 120 pounds of CNl"—and
has the machinery necessary to
turn the agent into an aerosol
cloud—"a pressure tank-assembly,
a hose assembly, and a pressure
regulator."
As documented in the Daily
articles, SRI worked on the
specific properties of the CS
versions of tear gas, and
experimented with CS and
simulants for CS to learn how best
to spray it out in an aerosol cloud
under pressure.
Effect On Refinements
Therefore, any refinement in
the M-5 device since 1964, or any
change in the adjustment of
pressure, nozzle characteristics or
any other parameter of the
spraying device, or any
improvement in the CS agent
itself would draw upon the
research reports which SRI
submitted to the Army between
1964 and the present (Note that
the 1964 manual mentioned
"CSI." Is there a "CS2" or
"CS3"?) SRI may well have done
work on tear gas before 1964

under an earlier CBW contract,
but they won't talk about it.
If Meaders still wants to
maintain that SRI is not
implicated in the Berkeley
helicopter gassing, he must prove
that the CS agent used at Berkeley
has not been improved since
1964, and that the M-5 device has
not been altered in components or
operation since that time.
And even if this were the case,
the fact would remain that SRI
did research expressly designed to
help the Army or National Guard
do what it did at Berkeley.
Examination Refused
The Army manual which
Meaders consulted came from the
SRI Library, according to a stamp
on one of the pages he sent the
Daily. The manual is called "Civil
Disturbances and Disasters."
Army units in the Stanford area
refused to allow the Daily to
examine a copy, but they did
reveal that the manual has been
revised since 1964. Perhaps
Meaders, with his access to
restricted government documents,
can find out for us if the revised
versions shows in detail how SRI
research was applied.
Incredibly, Meaders states 1.
his letter that "SRl's work in
dissemination of chemical agents
began late in 1964 and ended in
1967." Documentary evidence
was published in the May 26 Daily
which showed that SRI worked
on the dissemination of nerve gas
as early as 1958 and that SRI now
holds an Army CBW contract
called "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic
Powders," such as tear gas.
The Stanford community
should realize that we have no
guarantee that SRI will not
continue to do research in
chemical-biological warfare. The
SRI Board of Directors has
promised an end to research
"directly dealing with the
development of weapons" of
CBW.
That promise has no meaning,
since it will be SRI managers like
Homer Meaders who decide what
the words "directly dealing"
mean. Moreover, the Stanford
trustees have announced that they
will soon sever all ties between
Stanford and SRI. Then the SRI
Board of Directors will be free to
set any CBW research policy it
wants.

in Army Field Manual 19-15,
published in December, 1964. The
manual gives full instructions for
spraying crowds from a
helicopter.
This would indicate that this
device was a standard piece of
Army equipment in 1964, and
was developed at an earlier date.
Since SRl's work in
dissemination of chemical agents

began late in 1964 and ended in
1967, it seems obvious that this
particular helicopter did not make
use of any knowledge developed
at SRI.

Mr. Sweeney's reply:
My articles on May 23 and May
26 never stated that SRI
developed a particular piece of
Army hardware. Rather, I showed
that SRI worked on the
technology of disseminating tear,
a technology which is applicable
to the M-5 dispenser or any other
gadget the Army wants to use.
Homer Meaders' letter and the
accompanying xeroxed pages
from the Army field manual
actually lend important support
to the argument that SRl's
research was directly applicable to
the Berkeley atrocity. The
excerpts from the 1964 manual
describe the M-5 as large,
complicated device weighing more
than 200 lbs and occupying more
than 20 cubic feet.
It is adaptable to different
chemical agents—"so pounds of
CSI or 120 pounds of CNl"—and
has the machinery necessary to
turn the agent into an aerosol
cloud—"a pressure tank-assembly,
a hose assembly, and a pressure
regulator."
As documented in the Daily
articles, SRI worked on the
specific properties of the CS
versions of tear gas, and
experimented with CS and
simulants for CS to learn how best
to spray it out in an aerosol cloud
under pressure.
Effect On Refinements
Therefore, any refinement in
the M-5 device since 1964, or any
change in the adjustment of
pressure, nozzle characteristics or
any other parameter of the
spraying device, or any
improvement in the CS agent
itself would draw upon the
research reports which SRI
submitted to the Army between
1964 and the present (Note that
the 1964 manual mentioned
"CSI." Is there a "CS2" or
"CS3"?) SRI may well have done
work on tear gas before 1964

under an earlier CBW contract,
but they won't talk about it.
If Meaders still wants to
maintain that SRI is not
implicated in the Berkeley
helicopter gassing, he must prove
that the CS agent used at Berkeley
has not been improved since
1964, and that the M-5 device has
not been altered in components or
operation since that time.
And even if this were the case,
the fact would remain that SRI
did research expressly designed to
help the Army or National Guard
do what it did at Berkeley.
Examination Refused
The Army manual which
Meaders consulted came from the
SRI Library, according to a stamp
on one of the pages he sent the
Daily. The manual is called "Civil
Disturbances and Disasters."
Army units in the Stanford area
refused to allow the Daily to
examine a copy, but they did
reveal that the manual has been
revised since 1964. Perhaps
Meaders, with his access to
restricted government documents,
can find out for us if the revised
versions shows in detail how SRI
research was applied.
Incredibly, Meaders states 1.
his letter that "SRl's work in
dissemination of chemical agents
began late in 1964 and ended in
1967." Documentary evidence
was published in the May 26 Daily
which showed that SRI worked
on the dissemination of nerve gas
as early as 1958 and that SRI now
holds an Army CBW contract
called "Dissemination and Aerosol
Behavior of Hydrophobic
Powders," such as tear gas.
The Stanford community
should realize that we have no
guarantee that SRI will not
continue to do research in
chemical-biological warfare. The
SRI Board of Directors has
promised an end to research
"directly dealing with the
development of weapons" of
CBW.
That promise has no meaning,
since it will be SRI managers like
Homer Meaders who decide what
the words "directly dealing"
mean. Moreover, the Stanford
trustees have announced that they
will soon sever all ties between
Stanford and SRI. Then the SRI
Board of Directors will be free to
set any CBW research policy it
wants.
MICHAEL SWEENEY
Editor, The Daily:
Since a May 23 Daily article by
Michael Sweeney tried to
implicate SRI in the May 20 tear
gas spraying in Berkeley by a
National Guard helicopter, the
following facts should be noted.
Col. Andrew Wolfe, Public
Information Officer for the
National Guard, says that
helicopter used as a tear-gas
dispenser a device called a "Mark
5 riot control agent dispenser."
This device is described in detail
in Army Field Manual 19-15,
published in December, 1964. The
manual gives full instructions for
spraying crowds from a
helicopter.
This would indicate that this
device was a standard piece of
Army equipment in 1964, and
was developed at an earlier date.
