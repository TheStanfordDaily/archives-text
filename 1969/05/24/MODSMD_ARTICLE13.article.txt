## "ABM: An Evaluation of the Decision to Deploy an Anti-Ballistic Missile System" 
### 
BACK IN THE DAYS of back yard fallout shelters, seven
years ago, there remained the delusion that each one of
us could do something individually to protect our families
and ourselves.
Never mind that most of us didn't actually build a shelter, we
considered it. That showed our vulnerability to "security" appeals
right there. And ever since then, whenever the Pentagon
announced some new multi-billion dollar "safety" system we
tended to go for the "experts' " word that it was just the thing.
It is certainly understandable. A man has got to believe in
something. And in this, the nuclear-computer age, the forces
that control a man's life or death have been pretty much removed
from his own decision-making power. The data is so complicated
and so much of it is classified, how are we to know what to think
about it, one way or the other? Most of us laymen haven't yet
figured out if it's a good idea to get into airplanes, or how they
ever manage to stay up in the air.
With no way even to start thinking intelligently about today's
"security" problems, we tend simply not to think about them at
all. The result is that our safety is truly in the lap of the gods,
or, to put it more accurately, in the lap of the Pentagon.
Experts in high places "with greater access to information" tell
us that tor our safety we need this or that. And we implicitly give
our go-ahead and wind up paying for it besides. Like putting
quarters into the insurance machine before getting onto an air
plane. It won't keep the plane up, but at least it's doing something.
Which brings us to ABM.

"Anti-missile defense is an essential component in the network of military
systems designed to give the American people a seamless garment of
security in an age of acute danger."
—AP quote from pro-ABM presentation. May 7, 1969
The ABM (Sentinel-Safeguard) is probably the most compli
cated electronic system ever attempted.
Each of its elements — missiles, computers, radars—is at the
extreme of sophistication for its type. The computer program
ming alone, for example, presents problems not yet solved even
on the theoretical level.
The computers will be asked simultaneously to steer the radars,
identify potential targets, predict trajectories, distinguish between
warheads and the thousands of possible decoys, eliminate false
targets, reject signals from earlier explosions (some of which may
be deliberately diversionary), correct for blackout effects, allocate
and guide interceptor missiles, and automatically arm and fire
them if an enemy missile is interpreted as being in range.
All of this must be done continuously and with 1007 c precision
between the time attacking missiles first appear and their moment
of impact. That time may be as little as 10 minutes.
The whole operation, in other words, is just too rapid and com
plex even to allow for human checking or more than a last second
okay by the President.
The computer will do the checking itself.
Well. If everyone knew for sure that Safeguard would work,
then there might be some (shaky) confidence about turning our
lives over to it. But a look at the chart shows the gap between
expected performance and actual performance in the case of
systems many times less complex than this one. Performance is
nearly always below promise, even when there is plenty of time
and the possibility for testing.

There is no such margin of error with Safeguard. It must work
first time out. There is no reason to believe it will.
The possible consequences of its not working just so may be
illustrated by this Newsweek note, December 19, 1960, concern
ing the Pentagon's previous "security" creation, Ballistic Missile
Early Warning System :
"The Air Force disclosed last week that the giant radar picked
up a [hostile] signal, and the missile's' position [30 minutes from
a U.S. target] was instantly flashed on a screen at the under
ground SAC headquarters in Omaha."
Fortunately for the world, the reflex to counterstrike, which
was supposed to be nearly instantaneous upon sighting of such
an enemy missile heading our way, did not operate on this day,
simply because the scientists who worked on BMEWS radar,
and who supervised and knew its real capabilities had in their

hearts no confidence that it had yet been made to work with any
reliability. They realized the much too frequent fallibilities of
such inventions as these. It is a good thing they did. For as News
week concluded:
"The 'missile' that had reflected the radar signal turned out to
be the moon."

Malfunction of such new equipment as BMEWS is more the
rule than the exception. And yet now, some scientists at the
Pentagon say we should proceed with a far more difficult project,
and, what's worse, one that does not allow for ultimate human
analysis and control.

"The 'missile' that had reflected the radar signal turned out to
be the moon."

Malfunction of such new equipment as BMEWS is more the
rule than the exception. And yet now, some scientists at the
Pentagon say we should proceed with a far more difficult project,
and, what's worse, one that does not allow for ultimate human
analysis and control.
BACK IN THE DAYS of back yard fallout shelters, seven
years ago, there remained the delusion that each one of
us could do something individually to protect our families
and ourselves.
Never mind that most of us didn't actually build a shelter, we
considered it. That showed our vulnerability to "security" appeals
right there. And ever since then, whenever the Pentagon
announced some new multi-billion dollar "safety" system we
tended to go for the "experts' " word that it was just the thing.
It is certainly understandable. A man has got to believe in
something. And in this, the nuclear-computer age, the forces
that control a man's life or death have been pretty much removed
from his own decision-making power. The data is so complicated
and so much of it is classified, how are we to know what to think
about it, one way or the other? Most of us laymen haven't yet
figured out if it's a good idea to get into airplanes, or how they
ever manage to stay up in the air.
With no way even to start thinking intelligently about today's
"security" problems, we tend simply not to think about them at
all. The result is that our safety is truly in the lap of the gods,
or, to put it more accurately, in the lap of the Pentagon.
Experts in high places "with greater access to information" tell
us that tor our safety we need this or that. And we implicitly give
our go-ahead and wind up paying for it besides. Like putting
quarters into the insurance machine before getting onto an air
plane. It won't keep the plane up, but at least it's doing something.
Which brings us to ABM.

"Anti-missile defense is an essential component in the network of military
systems designed to give the American people a seamless garment of
security in an age of acute danger."
—AP quote from pro-ABM presentation. May 7, 1969
The ABM (Sentinel-Safeguard) is probably the most compli
cated electronic system ever attempted.
Each of its elements — missiles, computers, radars—is at the
extreme of sophistication for its type. The computer program
ming alone, for example, presents problems not yet solved even
on the theoretical level.
The computers will be asked simultaneously to steer the radars,
identify potential targets, predict trajectories, distinguish between
warheads and the thousands of possible decoys, eliminate false
targets, reject signals from earlier explosions (some of which may
be deliberately diversionary), correct for blackout effects, allocate
and guide interceptor missiles, and automatically arm and fire
them if an enemy missile is interpreted as being in range.
All of this must be done continuously and with 1007 c precision
between the time attacking missiles first appear and their moment
of impact. That time may be as little as 10 minutes.
The whole operation, in other words, is just too rapid and com
plex even to allow for human checking or more than a last second
okay by the President.
The computer will do the checking itself.
Well. If everyone knew for sure that Safeguard would work,
then there might be some (shaky) confidence about turning our
lives over to it. But a look at the chart shows the gap between
expected performance and actual performance in the case of
systems many times less complex than this one. Performance is
nearly always below promise, even when there is plenty of time
and the possibility for testing.

There is no such margin of error with Safeguard. It must work
first time out. There is no reason to believe it will.
The possible consequences of its not working just so may be
illustrated by this Newsweek note, December 19, 1960, concern
ing the Pentagon's previous "security" creation, Ballistic Missile
Early Warning System :
"The Air Force disclosed last week that the giant radar picked
up a [hostile] signal, and the missile's' position [30 minutes from
a U.S. target] was instantly flashed on a screen at the under
ground SAC headquarters in Omaha."
Fortunately for the world, the reflex to counterstrike, which
was supposed to be nearly instantaneous upon sighting of such
an enemy missile heading our way, did not operate on this day,
simply because the scientists who worked on BMEWS radar,
and who supervised and knew its real capabilities had in their

hearts no confidence that it had yet been made to work with any
reliability. They realized the much too frequent fallibilities of
such inventions as these. It is a good thing they did. For as News

and who supervised and knew its real capabilities had in their

hearts no confidence that it had yet been made to work with any
reliability. They realized the much too frequent fallibilities of
such inventions as these. It is a good thing they did. For as News
week concluded:
"The 'missile' that had reflected the radar signal turned out to
be the moon."

Malfunction of such new equipment as BMEWS is more the
rule than the exception. And yet now, some scientists at the
Pentagon say we should proceed with a far more difficult project,
and, what's worse, one that does not allow for ultimate human
analysis and control.
