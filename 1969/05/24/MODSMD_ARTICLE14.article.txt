# Modern Weapons Systems—Performance Measured Against Original Expectations
## 
### 
The chart compares actual perfor
mance achievement against Pentagon
promises for systems not nearly as
complex as Safeguard. The study
from which it was extracted also
shows that on the average these sys
tems—even if they didn't work at all
—cost from 200-300% more than was
budgeted for them, and whichever
ones were created in a hurry, like
Safeguard will he, cost the most
and failed the most. Included among
the "disappointments" are the
BMEWS system, the SAGE system,
and the DEW line system, which
have been the backbone of our "de-

Washington Post
fense" over the last years. This news
raises indelible questions concerning
how "safe" complex technology has
ever made us. Of course, even if they
"work," anything less than destruction
of every warhead aimed at our cities
would result in millions of deaths.
And there simply is no way to calcu
late for every contingency of an at
tack. As Professor Herbert York,
writing in Scientific American, said:
"Such calculations always involve
predictions about the form of the
attack. But since the form is un
knowable the calculations are non
sensical."
