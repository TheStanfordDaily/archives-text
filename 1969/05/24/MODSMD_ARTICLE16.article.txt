• ROTC Committee

A faculty-student committee
has been appointed by President
Kenneth S, Pitzer to advise him
on the future of the Reserve
Officer Training Corps at
Stanford.
In May, the faculty voted to
end academic credit for military
training and education, starting
with freshmen entering in 1970.
Pitzer said he would consult with
the Department of Defense
toward an appropriate non-credit
ROTC program.
In appointing the committee,
whose chairman is Prof. Alan S.
Manne, economics and operations
research, Pitzer said he expected
negotiations with the military
services to continue through the
summer and fall. Other committee
members include Professors
Gordon H. Bower, J. Keith Mann,
Jean Mayers, and Lyman Van
Slyke, and students Carol Roesch,
William Blanchard, and Dan E.
Caldwell.
• Tape Decks
Faced with an avalanche of
stereo tape deck thefts from autos
parked at Stanford University,
campus police have instituted
emergency measures.
Effective immediately, any
member of the student body,
faculty or staff who wants his
license number and other
information engraved on his
stereo tape unit can have it done
free at the Police Department.

Manne, economics and operations
research, Pitzer said he expected
negotiations with the military
services to continue through the
summer and fall. Other committee
members include Professors
Gordon H. Bower, J. Keith Mann,
Jean Mayers, and Lyman Van
Slyke, and students Carol Roesch,
William Blanchard, and Dan E.
Caldwell.
