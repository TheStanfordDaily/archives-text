# Radical Research Institute Begins Activity Under Fire
## 
### 
By BARBARA SIMON
A new radical research
organization, tentatively named
the Pacific Research Institute, has
already been attacked by Palo
Alto Times Editor Alexander
Bodi. Harry Cleaver, graduate in
economics, Michael Sweeney,
senior in psychology, and lawyer
Jim Wolpman are incorporating
directors for the group, which will
focus on current socio-economic
problems.
Bodi accuses the new political
research group of radical activities
and suggests a multi-pronged
attack to smash it before it cam
get under way. The non-profit tax
exempt organization hopes to
amass a publicly available file
and library of data on economic
development and growth as well
as sociological and political
studies.
The exact program is still in
the planning stage, and will
develop largely according to the
specific interests of the
researchers. Though the local
scene and SRI activities will be
included, the agenda is neither
Stanford focused, Stanford
sponsored, nor strictly a part of
any Stanford radical student
organization as Bodi intimates.
Bodi named an Alpine Road
address as the "radicals'
headquarters for the summer" and
invites nonradicals "to counter
this kind of activity." Bodi slams
every possible zoning and safety
ordinance on the researchers.

"Is the property properly
zoned for public gatherings??" he
asks. "Is there adequate offstreet
parking? Are there sufficient fire
extinguishers and other safety
measures to protect the welfare of
the radicals who will be gathering
there? Are there adequate toilet
facilities—perhaps segregated for
mixed attendance?
"Are the building's
foundations solid enough to keep
the structure from collapsing on
the substantial crowd that might
gather there? How about the
electrical wiring? And sewage
disposal? There are all sorts of
city and district ordinances and
regulations that could be brought
to bear."
Bodi encourages further
harassment by "infiltration,"
enjoining conservatives to attend
meetings, get on mailing lists, and
be elected to office within the
organization.
'Observer' Blames 'Times'
In addition to scourging the
"administrative repression" Bodi
calls for, the latest Peninsula
Observer points out "the Times
bears at least part of the blame for
the bombings of the Free
University and local left
organizations last
winter .. . Bodi's quoting the
address of the PRI [Pacific
Research Institute] is a direct
incitement to the next batch of
bombers."
The Observer holds the Times'
editorial and like anti-radical

propaganda "responsible for the
climate of opinion in this country
that makes bombers possible."
Concerning Bodi's
recommendation for infiltration,
the Observer points to the reality
of right-wingers acting as "tools of
the Stanford administration, the
local police, and the Stanford
Research Institute in the recent
activities against SRI.
Right Wing Activity
Rightwingers took names and
photographs, swore out affidavits, \
delivered injunctions and I
probably fingered Stanford
radicals to the governmental
committees that are currently '
warming up for an all-out attack
on the student left.
There is a right-wing revival
going on, and it's going on
because it's being encouraged by
people who have something to
protect, and who aren't too
particular about what they use to
protect it."
In answer to Bodi's threats of j
zoning and ordinance harassment,
the Observer retorts, "When
political decisions, like whether to
drive the radicals out of your
town, are put into the hands of
building authorities, or even the
police, there's not much the

A new radical research
organization, tentatively named
the Pacific Research Institute, has
already been attacked by Palo
Alto Times Editor Alexander
Bodi. Harry Cleaver, graduate in
economics, Michael Sweeney,
senior in psychology, and lawyer
Jim Wolpman are incorporating
directors for the group, which will
focus on current socio-economic
problems.
Bodi accuses the new political
research group of radical activities
and suggests a multi-pronged
attack to smash it before it cam
get under way. The non-profit tax
exempt organization hopes to
amass a publicly available file
and library of data on economic
development and growth as well
as sociological and political
studies.
The exact program is still in
the planning stage, and will
develop largely according to the
specific interests of the
researchers. Though the local
scene and SRI activities will be
included, the agenda is neither
Stanford focused, Stanford
sponsored, nor strictly a part of
any Stanford radical student
organization as Bodi intimates.
Bodi named an Alpine Road
address as the "radicals'
headquarters for the summer" and
invites nonradicals "to counter
this kind of activity." Bodi slams
every possible zoning and safety
ordinance on the researchers.

"Is the property properly
zoned for public gatherings??" he
asks. "Is there adequate offstreet
parking? Are there sufficient fire
extinguishers and other safety
measures to protect the welfare of
the radicals who will be gathering
there? Are there adequate toilet
facilities—perhaps segregated for
mixed attendance?
"Are the building's
foundations solid enough to keep
the structure from collapsing on
the substantial crowd that might
gather there? How about the
electrical wiring? And sewage
disposal? There are all sorts of
city and district ordinances and
regulations that could be brought
to bear."
Bodi encourages further
harassment by "infiltration,"
enjoining conservatives to attend
meetings, get on mailing lists, and
be elected to office within the
organization.
'Observer' Blames 'Times'
In addition to scourging the
"administrative repression" Bodi
calls for, the latest Peninsula
Observer points out "the Times
bears at least part of the blame for
the bombings of the Free
University and local left
organizations last
winter .. . Bodi's quoting the
address of the PRI [Pacific
Research Institute] is a direct
incitement to the next batch of
bombers."
The Observer holds the Times'
editorial and like anti-radical

propaganda "responsible for the
climate of opinion in this country
that makes bombers possible."
Concerning Bodi's
recommendation for infiltration,
the Observer points to the reality
of right-wingers acting as "tools of
the Stanford administration, the
local police, and the Stanford
Research Institute in the recent
activities against SRI.
Right Wing Activity
Rightwingers took names and
photographs, swore out affidavits, \
delivered injunctions and I
probably fingered Stanford
radicals to the governmental
committees that are currently '
warming up for an all-out attack
on the student left.
There is a right-wing revival
going on, and it's going on

people who have something to
