# The 						Well-Tuned Ear
## The 						Sounds Of Summer 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
There will bo lots and lots of
good sounds around the Bay this
summer, regardless of your
specific tastes. I favor Bach,
Beethoven, Brubeck and Doors, so
I'll be busy; but even if 18th
century French Opera is your bag,
you will be able to find it.
A profusion of Music Festivals
and other money-losing
productions sprinkle the calendar;
I'll make an effort to keep you
informed.
The Stanford Summer Festival,
of course, is the biggest, most
well-known, most diversified, and
most sold out of any of these
events. Stephen Baffrey, the
Festival director, is always
working on the eighth task: to
present the history of music in
repertory in eight weeks.
Saucy lad, you say, but no:
they are presenting medieval,

renaissance and baroque (New
York Pro Music, Stanford
Renaissance Band, classic and
romantic (Guarneri Quartet, New
York Chamber soloists), dixieland
and rock (Preservation Hall .Jazz
Band and New York Rock & Roll
Ensemble.
Other Features
The only noticeable absence is
serial, twelve-tone, and electronic
music (John Cage next year?). A
fine guitarist, Oscar Ghiglia, a
respected organist, Cathlene
Crozier, and a young soprano,
Elly Ameling, will perform works
from several periods. In addition,
a number of ancillary events will
be staged, including concerts,
lectures and meet-the-artists, at
(thankfully) lower prices.
Other Festivals include those at
Carmel, Saratoga (opens Saturday
with a Mozart opera) and Concord
(opens August 28). A few of the

free things which sound like fun
include the 193 rd birthday of San
Francisco with a concert at the
Golden Gate Park Bandstand at 2
p.m. this Sunday, a chamber
music concert at the Paul M;u>son
Vineyards in Saratoga at 3 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, and Gilbert
and Sullivan's Gondoliers also
Sunday at 2 p.m. on the Sigmund
Stern Grove in the City—a fun bit
of fluff.
Other events of interest include
Arthur Fiedler gamely trying to
get the San Francisco Symphony
to groove like the Boston Pops,
coloratura Joan Sutherland at the
Masonic, Gounod's "Romeo et
Juliette" sung in French at the
Opera, and a ballet, all in the City.
The Tresidder Box Office (x
4317) hands out free information
about everything that costs, and
will gladly sell you tickets, too.
The Stanford Summer Festival has
its own box office at x 2932. He
who hesitates stays home, so
hurry.
Nothing to do Thursday? May
I suggest seeing the Guarneri
String Quartet, playing in Dink at
8:30. This young group has been
hailed by Time magazine as the
"heirs to the Budapest String
Quartet," mainly for their
interpretations of Beethoven,
Mozart and Schumann.
Thursday's concert features
Beethoven, Mozart and
Hindemith, so it should be quite
good.
Sounds like summer. Enjoy,
enjoy.


OPENS THURSDAY—The Guarneri String Quartet, hailed as the successors to the
Budapest String Quartet, open the musical portion of the Stanford Summer
Festival Thursday night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.

music concert at the Paul M;u>son
Vineyards in Saratoga at 3 p.m.
Saturday and Sunday, and Gilbert
and Sullivan's Gondoliers also
Sunday at 2 p.m. on the Sigmund
Stern Grove in the City—a fun bit
of fluff.
Other events of interest include
Arthur Fiedler gamely trying to
get the San Francisco Symphony
to groove like the Boston Pops,
coloratura Joan Sutherland at the
Masonic, Gounod's "Romeo et
Juliette" sung in French at the
Opera, and a ballet, all in the City.
The Tresidder Box Office (x
4317) hands out free information
about everything that costs, and
will gladly sell you tickets, too.
The Stanford Summer Festival has
its own box office at x 2932. He
who hesitates stays home, so
hurry.
Nothing to do Thursday? May
I suggest seeing the Guarneri
String Quartet, playing in Dink at
8:30. This young group has been
hailed by Time magazine as the
"heirs to the Budapest String
Quartet," mainly for their
interpretations of Beethoven,
Mozart and Schumann.
Thursday's concert features
Beethoven, Mozart and
Hindemith, so it should be quite
good.
Sounds like summer. Enjoy,
enjoy.


OPENS THURSDAY—The Guarneri String Quartet, hailed as the successors to the
Budapest String Quartet, open the musical portion of the Stanford Summer
Festival Thursday night in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
There will bo lots and lots of
good sounds around the Bay this
summer, regardless of your
specific tastes. I favor Bach,
Beethoven, Brubeck and Doors, so
I'll be busy; but even if 18th
century French Opera is your bag,
you will be able to find it.
A profusion of Music Festivals
and other money-losing
productions sprinkle the calendar;
I'll make an effort to keep you
informed.
The Stanford Summer Festival,
of course, is the biggest, most
well-known, most diversified, and
most sold out of any of these
events. Stephen Baffrey, the
Festival director, is always
working on the eighth task: to
present the history of music in
repertory in eight weeks.
Saucy lad, you say, but no:
they are presenting medieval,

renaissance and baroque (New
York Pro Music, Stanford
Renaissance Band, classic and
romantic (Guarneri Quartet, New
York Chamber soloists), dixieland
and rock (Preservation Hall .Jazz
Band and New York Rock & Roll
Ensemble.
Other Features
The only noticeable absence is
serial, twelve-tone, and electronic
music (John Cage next year?). A
fine guitarist, Oscar Ghiglia, a
respected organist, Cathlene
Crozier, and a young soprano,
Elly Ameling, will perform works
from several periods. In addition,
a number of ancillary events will
be staged, including concerts,
lectures and meet-the-artists, at
(thankfully) lower prices.
Other Festivals include those at
Carmel, Saratoga (opens Saturday
with a Mozart opera) and Concord
(opens August 28). A few of the

free things which sound like fun
include the 193 rd birthday of San
Francisco with a concert at the
Golden Gate Park Bandstand at 2
p.m. this Sunday, a chamber
music concert at the Paul M;u>son
Vineyards in Saratoga at 3 p.m.
