# M.E. Prof Named Dean Of Students
## 
### 
Peter Z. Bulkeley, Stanford's
new Dean of Students, plans to
make the central concern of his
office "the quality of student
life." To do this Bulkeley hopes
to have the enforcement of
University regulations transferred
to a "University prosecutor."
Bulkeley's appointment as
Dean of Students was announced
by President Kenneth Pitzer on
June 3. The former dean, Joel P.
Smith, resigned last January in

order to assume the presidency of
Denison University in Ohio.
Bulkeley comes to his new post
after twelve years on Stanford's
engineering faculty. Although his
recent experience has been in the
Department of Mechanical
Engineering, the new dean
attended Bowdoin, a liberal arts
college in Maine, as an
undergraduate, and believes he
will be able to relate to
humanities students without
difficulty.
According to Bulkeley, the two
major jobs of the typical Dean of
Students office in the days of "in
loco parentis" were "loving" and
"disciplining," two functions
which parents perform.
Bulkeley sees today's students
as more sophisticated, and he
finds the dean's disciplinary
function "anomalous" and
"inappropriate." He told The
Daily in an interview that he did
not want his office to be a linear
extension of the dean's office in a
high school.
Bulkeley asserts that there is a
need for integrated planning for
the whole University community.
As an example, he pointed out
that planning for fraternity
members was one thing, but that
the interaction of students' lives,
housing, and education is another.
He thinks that the elements of
i the residence system should be
viewed as a system and not as
discrete entities. Bulkeley says
that what happens in Florence
Moore's "impacted ghetto of 450
women" affects what can happen
in other residences like Wilbur or
Roble.
