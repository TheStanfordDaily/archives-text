# McClellan Committee
## Pitzer Answers Subpoena 
### 
Replying to a congressional
subpoena June 3, Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer supplied
the McClellan Committee, a
Senate subcommittee investigating
campus disorders, with all
requested material which Stanford
had in its files, but had trouble
convincing McClellan that was all
Stanford had.
Provost Richard Lyman told a
group in Memorial Church the day
before, "We must comply with
any requests that are
constitutional."
Pitzer had previously released a
statement to the University
community in which he declared:
"Our obligation to abide by the
law would be identical even if we
did not receive a penny from the
government . . .We cannot guide
ourselves by the rule of law and
deny that rule when it suits us in
our relations with others."
Names Provided
Pitzer provided the committee
with 16 names of persons found
guilty of taking part in campus

disruptions and listed information
of federal financial aid received by
27 individuals at Stanford. He
informed the committee that
some of the organizations listed in
the subpoena were not registered
with the University.
Of on-campus organizations
Pitzer said: "We do not believe
that disclosure of that (one)
member of (an) organization
whose name has been filed with
the University is either required
by or is in furtherance of your
subpoena, since we have no
official records disclosing whether
or not such individual is or is not
an officer of the organization.
"Indeed, I would be most
reluctant in any event to disclose
the names of those individuals
without some clarification of the
scope and purpose of your
investigation and the possible
pertinency that such names could
have to that purpose."
McClellan Sends Letter
On June 7, Senator John
McClellan, chairman of the
committee, wrote Pitzer charging
that Pitzer's information supplied
June 3 was "not fully responsive"
to the subpoena.
Noting that his committee's list
in the subpoena of individuals and
organizations was drawn from
Stanford's and SRl's court
injunctions, McClellan said that
"it seemed incompatible" that
Stanford would afterwards state
that it had no knowledge of the
existence of certain of these
organizations and the identities of

their officers.
Pitzer then pointed out to
McClellan that the University's
own injunction named only
individuals, and hi. averted that
SRI, whose injunction named
student groups, was a separate
organization from the University.
Pitzer explained in further
detail Stanford's policy of not
keeping the names of officers of
student groups on file.
Committee Satisfied
It is believed that the
McClellan Committee is satisfied
for the present with the
University's response.
Response to the whole
encounter with the McClellan
Committee varied. Stanford SDS
demanded that Pitzer "tell the
McClellan Committee nothing and
provide them with none of the
information it seeks."
SDS members Jeff Blum, Fred
Cohen, and Marc Weiss said that
the McClellan Committee's efforts
appeared to be part of "a
coordinated effort to incapacitate
campus radicals over the summer
and quell campus disturbances in
the fall." They maintained that
the main function of disruptions
has been to make the public aware
of certain issues and induce
changes.
The Stanford Daily warned
editorially that federal control
over the universities was nearly a
stranglehold and contended that
the extent of federal funding at
Stanford, left the administration
almost completely at McClellan's

mercy.
Lyman's Comments
Provost Lyman said, "The very
places that are struggling hardest
to take care of their own
(disciplinary) problems feel as if
the tools for doing that are being
snatched from their hands by
federal authorities thousands of
miles from the campus scene."
Lyman counseled against
defiance of the subpoena and
claimed "it is going to
take . . .years of hard work to
restore enough mutual confidence
in Americans to wipe out the
chance for a second round of
McCarthy ism in the 1970'5."
Lyman said he felt that "many
if not most members of Congress
believe, as do vast numbers of
Americans that university
faculties, administrators, and
student bodies have been far too
permissive in dealing with
disruptions."
He called for people who
opposed ''unwarranted
intrusions" to keep the focus of
their endeavors on "the objective
of protecting the university and
its members" from such
interference.
Two former officers of
Stanford alumni clubs in southern
California sent Senator McClellan
a telegram urging that he use "all
measures within your authority"
to compel the University to
provide the information which
was subpoenaed.
