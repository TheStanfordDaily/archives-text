# For National Convention:
## Stanford Said No To SDS 
### BILL EVERS 
The Stanford administration
denied June 4 a request from the
Stanford chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society for
permission to hold the national
SDS convention on the Stanford
campus.
SDS member Leonard Siegel
described the administration's
action as "a clear statement of a
political position vis-a-vis SDS by
the University," while University
President Kenneth Pitzer said that
he did not intend to change the
policy of denying the use of
Stanford facilities to "political
action groups other than local
chapters registered as voluntary
organizations of the University."
The initial request to have the
national convention here from
June 16 to June 22 came in a
letter written June 2 by Siegel. He
asked for the use of Encina
Pavilion and about 25 classrooms.
He also indicated that there was a
possibility that some delegates
might need an area where they
could lay out their sleeping bags.
Violates University Policy
In denying the SDS request,

Assistant Business Manager
Edward A. Scoles, who said he
had discussed the matter with the
President's Office, stated the
University's policy on use of
campus facilities by political
action groups. In addition, Scoles
declared that "the University is
not prepared to undertake the
additional security and other
expenses which we believe would
be required for a meeting of an
organization with the national
record of SDS."
Siegel of Stanford SDS wrote
back to Scoles, saying that
rejecting the convention on the
ground that it was a national, not
a local, meeting of SDS was
"essentially bureaucratic and
arbitrary, and therefore
insufficient."
In a letter to President Pitzer,
Siegel discussed the "security"
problem raised in Scoles' letter.
Siegel noted that SDS's national
office and its Stanford chapter
were "willing to make verbal or
written commitments to accept
complete legal and financial
responsibility for the actions of
delegates." He promised that an
agenda would be submitted and

that the conference would be
"entirely open" and would engage
in "no political or social action
whatever." Siegel mentioned the
"fine record of conduct" of
delegates to previous SDS
conventions at the Universities of
Indiana and Kentucky.
Would Alleviate Tensions
In two of his letters, Siegel
suggested that if the
administration would grant SDS's
request, it would alleviate tensions
on the Stanford campus. On one
occasion, he also commented that
there had been "serious
discussions" within the Stanford
chapter about Pitzer's June 14
inauguration as Stanford's new
president.
Siegel told Pitzer, "This is an
opportunity for Stanford to show
the Left the same impartiality it
does to the Department of
Defense." But Pitzer upheld
Scoles' decision not to allow the
convention.
According to the Stanford
University News Service, Stanford
rejects 30 to 50 requests a year
for use of its facilities for
conferences.
