# Commencement Quiet; Wirtz Boosts Idealism
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Traditional academic pomp
and ceremony was in full bloom
at Stanford during the weekend of
Commencement, June 14-15.
The two days were highlighted
by the inauguration of Kenneth
Sanborn Pitzer as the sixth
president of Stanford Univeristy
and a commencement address by
former Secretary of Labor Willard
Wirtz which drew a standing
ovation, the only one in recent
memory except for that given
retiring President Wallace Sterling
last year.
There is "reason and honest
hope" to believe that idealism has
a better chance today than it had
in the past, Wirtz told an audience
of 8,500 in Frost Amphitheater.
But he said this would happen
only if youth "makes now on the
community of the country and
the world the same kind of
demands that it has made on the
colleges and universities—with the
same degrees of persistence."
(See excerpts from his speech
on page two.)
Threats of disruptions at the
two events failed to materialize.
Members of SDS attended both
ceremonies, but there were no
incidents. Members of the
administration kept a wary eye on
the radicals during the
proceedings, however.
There were a few, small
individual protests. At the
inauguration, a student host,
former speaker of the Legislature
Yale Braunstein, appeared in
academic robe and coolie hat.

At Commencement, several
graduates hat anti-ABM stickers
plastered on their robes or
mortarboards. Several wore beads,
and one carried a dog as he went
up to receive his diploma from
President Pitzer. But this was the
full extent of out-of-the-ordinary
activity.
The featured speaker at Pitzer's
inauguration was John Gardner,
head of the Urban Coalition,
Stanford Trustee, and former
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare.
He declared that intervention
into the University by federal and
state governments is a
''counter-productive and
potentially dangerous" means of
saving these institutions.
"If universities are to be saved,
they will have to do it
themselves," he added.

At Commencement, the annual
Dinkelspiel Awards were given
out, tliis year going to seniors
Norton Batkin III and Joyce
Elaine King and Law Professor
Herbert L. Packer.
Packer was director of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), and Batkin a member of
the SES Steering Committee. Miss
King, a black, has worked with
the Personnel Office in training
minority students on the
University staff.
The Dinkelspiel Awards are
given for outstanding service to
the University.
Packer, who recently suffered a
stroke, appeared in a wheelchair.
During his address, Wirtz noted
that "the targets for this year
were close at hand, in eary range:
research laboratories conducting
