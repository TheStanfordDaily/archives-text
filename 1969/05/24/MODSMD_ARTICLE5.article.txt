# Commencement Quiet; Wirtz Boosts Idealism
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Traditional academic pomp
and ceremony was in full bloom
at Stanford during the weekend of
Commencement, June 14-15.
The two days were highlighted
by the inauguration of Kenneth
Sanborn Pitzer as the sixth
president of Stanford Univeristy
and a commencement address by
former Secretary of Labor Willard
Wirtz which drew a standing
ovation, the only one in recent
memory except for that given
retiring President Wallace Sterling
last year.
There is "reason and honest
hope" to believe that idealism has
a better chance today than it had
in the past, Wirtz told an audience
of 8,500 in Frost Amphitheater.
But he said this would happen
only if youth "makes now on the
community of the country and
the world the same kind of
demands that it has made on the
colleges and universities—with the
same degrees of persistence."
(See excerpts from his speech
on page two.)
Threats of disruptions at the
two events failed to materialize.
Members of SDS attended both
ceremonies, but there were no
incidents. Members of the
administration kept a wary eye on
the radicals during the
proceedings, however.
There were a few, small
individual protests. At the
inauguration, a student host,
former speaker of the Legislature
Yale Braunstein, appeared in
academic robe and coolie hat.

At Commencement, several
graduates hat anti-ABM stickers
plastered on their robes or
mortarboards. Several wore beads,
and one carried a dog as he went
up to receive his diploma from
President Pitzer. But this was the
full extent of out-of-the-ordinary
activity.
The featured speaker at Pitzer's
inauguration was John Gardner,
head of the Urban Coalition,
Stanford Trustee, and former
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare.
He declared that intervention
into the University by federal and
state governments is a
''counter-productive and
potentially dangerous" means of
saving these institutions.
"If universities are to be saved,
they will have to do it
themselves," he added.

At Commencement, the annual
Dinkelspiel Awards were given
out, tliis year going to seniors
Norton Batkin III and Joyce
Elaine King and Law Professor
Herbert L. Packer.
Packer was director of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), and Batkin a member of
the SES Steering Committee. Miss
King, a black, has worked with
the Personnel Office in training
minority students on the
University staff.
The Dinkelspiel Awards are
given for outstanding service to
the University.
Packer, who recently suffered a
stroke, appeared in a wheelchair.

During his address, Wirtz noted
that "the targets for this year
were close at hand, in eary range:
research laboratories conducting
CBW experiments a few blocks
from the dormitories; worn out
University procedures that people
just on the other side of the desk
had the authority to change . . .
Malignant Anachronisms
"Tomorrow's objectives have
to be the malignant anachronisms
of a government that seems very
far away and held by those with
intransigent interests in the status
quo . . .
"SRI is one thing. ABM is
another. Just being 'against the
military-industrial complex' is
only an easy catharsis unless we
go on to establish a set of
affirmative priorities."
Earlier that day, in the
baccalaureate sermon, the
suffragen bishop of Washington
D.C., the Right Rev. Paul Moore,
Jr., said that today's student
unrest may be part of a
"tremendous historical event as
complicated and as far-reaching as
the Renaissance or the Industrial

Revolution."
Reassuring Revolt
"I think it's a reassuring revolt
against the conformist culture of
technology in a very deep,
perhaps even an unconscious
level," the ex-Marine and a
member of the NAACP's
Committee of 100 added.
At the later exercises for
advanced degree graduates in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences, outgoing H & S Dean
Robert Sears said the population
explosion may be the major
source of social frustration for the
young.
When population growth is
contrasted with the increase in
formal leadership positions in our
society "y° u cannot avoid the
conclusion that it's darned hard
these days to get daddy's
attention," he said. "There are
too many children in the family
and too few leadership and
decision-making figures to go
around."

of 8,500 in Frost Amphitheater.
But he said this would happen
only if youth "makes now on the
community of the country and
the world the same kind of
demands that it has made on the
colleges and universities—with the
same degrees of persistence."
(See excerpts from his speech
on page two.)
Threats of disruptions at the
two events failed to materialize.
Members of SDS attended both
ceremonies, but there were no
incidents. Members of the
administration kept a wary eye on
the radicals during the
proceedings, however.
There were a few, small
individual protests. At the
inauguration, a student host,
former speaker of the Legislature
Yale Braunstein, appeared in
academic robe and coolie hat.

At Commencement, several
graduates hat anti-ABM stickers
plastered on their robes or
mortarboards. Several wore beads,
and one carried a dog as he went
up to receive his diploma from
President Pitzer. But this was the
full extent of out-of-the-ordinary
activity.
The featured speaker at Pitzer's
inauguration was John Gardner,
head of the Urban Coalition,
Stanford Trustee, and former
Secretary of Health, Education
and Welfare.
He declared that intervention
into the University by federal and
state governments is a
''counter-productive and
potentially dangerous" means of
saving these institutions.
"If universities are to be saved,
they will have to do it
themselves," he added.

At Commencement, the annual
Dinkelspiel Awards were given
out, tliis year going to seniors
Norton Batkin III and Joyce
Elaine King and Law Professor
Herbert L. Packer.
Packer was director of the
Study of Education at Stanford
(SES), and Batkin a member of
the SES Steering Committee. Miss
King, a black, has worked with
the Personnel Office in training
minority students on the
University staff.
The Dinkelspiel Awards are
given for outstanding service to
the University.
Packer, who recently suffered a
stroke, appeared in a wheelchair.
During his address, Wirtz noted
that "the targets for this year
were close at hand, in eary range:
research laboratories conducting
CBW experiments a few blocks
from the dormitories; worn out
University procedures that people
just on the other side of the desk
had the authority to change . . .
Malignant Anachronisms
"Tomorrow's objectives have
to be the malignant anachronisms
of a government that seems very
far away and held by those with
intransigent interests in the status
quo . . .
"SRI is one thing. ABM is
another. Just being 'against the
military-industrial complex' is
only an easy catharsis unless we
go on to establish a set of
affirmative priorities."
Earlier that day, in the
baccalaureate sermon, the
suffragen bishop of Washington
D.C., the Right Rev. Paul Moore,
Jr., said that today's student
unrest may be part of a
"tremendous historical event as
complicated and as far-reaching as
the Renaissance or the Industrial

Revolution."
Reassuring Revolt
"I think it's a reassuring revolt
against the conformist culture of
technology in a very deep,
perhaps even an unconscious
level," the ex-Marine and a
member of the NAACP's
Committee of 100 added.
At the later exercises for
advanced degree graduates in the
School of Humanities and
Sciences, outgoing H & S Dean
Robert Sears said the population
explosion may be the major
source of social frustration for the
young.
When population growth is
contrasted with the increase in
formal leadership positions in our
society "y° u cannot avoid the
conclusion that it's darned hard
these days to get daddy's
attention," he said. "There are
too many children in the family
and too few leadership and
decision-making figures to go
around."
Traditional academic pomp
and ceremony was in full bloom
at Stanford during the weekend of
Commencement, June 14-15.
The two days were highlighted
by the inauguration of Kenneth
Sanborn Pitzer as the sixth
president of Stanford Univeristy
and a commencement address by
former Secretary of Labor Willard
Wirtz which drew a standing
ovation, the only one in recent
memory except for that given
retiring President Wallace Sterling
last year.
There is "reason and honest
hope" to believe that idealism has
a better chance today than it had
in the past, Wirtz told an audience
of 8,500 in Frost Amphitheater.
But he said this would happen
only if youth "makes now on the
community of the country and
the world the same kind of
