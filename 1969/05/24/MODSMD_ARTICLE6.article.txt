# Trustees Support Lowâ€”Cost Housing
## 
### 
Trustees of Stanford have
authorized "urgent exploration"
of a possible site for low and
moderate income rental housing
on University lands.
The site is located southeast of
the Page Mi 11 -Foot hi 11
intersection, near Frenchman's
Hill, a faculty-staff housing area.
The Trustees authorized
President Kenneth S. Pitzer and
Vice President Alf Brandin to
explore with developers and
government agencies "any and all
alternative proposals, including
appropriate zoning, financial
assistance, and rent subsidies,
toward the objective of helping to
meet a community need for
low-rent housing."
Occupancy of some or all of
the proposed rental housing
would be open to the public,
subject to those qualifications
established by governmental
agencies providing rent subsidies.
Efforts would be made to allocate
some of the proposed unit to help
meet the low-rent housing
demand among University
employees.

A recent student-faculty-staff
committee report recommended
the construction of
open-occupancy low-rent units,
and suggested that raw land be
leased free from the University. It
noted, however, that the Trustees
might face legal restraints if this
were done and the units were
open to those not otherwise
affiliated with the University.
"Truly significant rental
reductions can be achieved only
through federal interest subsidy
programs," the committee noted.
At current prices, the group
estimated full cost rentals would
run from $175 to $275 per
month. Under present federal
subsidies alone, this figure could
be reduced by as much as $95 per
month for persons with an annual
income of less than $5,000.
The Trustees also approved a
general site for development of
junior faculty and staff housing
rental units. This is located along
the north side of Bowdoin Street,
adjoining the Hacienda,
Escondido Elementary School,
and the campus recreational
center.
