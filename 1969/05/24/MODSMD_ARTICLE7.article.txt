# Summer Festival Opens New Season
## 
### 
The 1969 season of the
Stanford Summer Festival of the
Arts opens tonight with the West
Coast debut of the internationally
famous Bil Baird Marionette
Theater.
The Festival runs for 56 days
and includes 130 events, filling
the spectrum of artistic endeavor,
from a survey of New York
Off-Broadway Theater, to the
Joffrey Ballet, and classical, jazz,
and pop music.
Baird brings two productions
to Stanford. "People is the Thing
that the World is Fullest Of," a
topical revue, will be seen tonight
at 8 p.m. in Memorial
Auditorium. It will also be staged
nightly June 26 through June 29.
His other production is "Davy
Jones' Locker," a fantasy for
children, which will play
Wednesday night at 8 p.m., and
Saturday and Sunday at 2:30. All
performances are in Mem Aud.
Baird believes that puppets can
best be used for satire. "People
Is," a> revue of bright songs and
skits, spoofs such problems as the
population explosion, air
pollution, and beatnik

conformity.
"You can do very abstract
things with puppets," Baird says.
For example, a hilarious seduction
routine is depicted in a skit called
"The Lovers." Using no dialogue,
but a background recording of the
song, "Lover," the boy and girl
puppet express the joy, hesitancy,
and anguish of lovers everywhere
and of every age.
For "People Is," Baird uses a
cast of 165—157 of whom are
puppets. "The figures can dance,
swim, fly, concertize, gulp down
booze, make love, sword-fight,
walk on stilts, or impersonate
such well-knowns as Leonard
Bernstein or Abe Lincoln," he
notes.
The puppeteer admits that "we
wrote 'Davy Jones' Locker' to
amuse ourselves, but like our
'Winnie the Pooh' performance, it
gets an enormous response from
adults." The play revolves around
a sea monster who grows small
because no one believes in him,
and a mermaid who wishes to
become a girl.
Also opening this week is the
Guarneri String quartet

Jones' Locker," a fantasy for
children, which will play
Wednesday night at 8 p.m., and
Saturday and Sunday at 2:30. All
performances are in Mem Aud.
Baird believes that puppets can
best be used for satire. "People
Is," a> revue of bright songs and
skits, spoofs such problems as the
population explosion, air
pollution, and beatnik

conformity.
"You can do very abstract
things with puppets," Baird says.
For example, a hilarious seduction
routine is depicted in a skit called
"The Lovers." Using no dialogue,
but a background recording of the
song, "Lover," the boy and girl
puppet express the joy, hesitancy,
and anguish of lovers everywhere
and of every age.
For "People Is," Baird uses a
cast of 165—157 of whom are
puppets. "The figures can dance,
swim, fly, concertize, gulp down
booze, make love, sword-fight,
walk on stilts, or impersonate
such well-knowns as Leonard
Bernstein or Abe Lincoln," he
notes.
The puppeteer admits that "we
wrote 'Davy Jones' Locker' to
amuse ourselves, but like our
'Winnie the Pooh' performance, it
gets an enormous response from
adults." The play revolves around
a sea monster who grows small
because no one believes in him,
and a mermaid who wishes to
become a girl.
Also opening this week is the
Guarneri String quartet


PEOPLE IS-Puppctccr with Bi! Baird's company manipulates his charges in "The
