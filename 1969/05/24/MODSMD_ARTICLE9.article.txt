# SDS Split

### 
The SDS national convention in Chicago has exposed very
publicly what many have known for a long time: that SDS
has two souls.
One group in SDS has a philosophy which is in what Carl
Oglesby, a former national officer of SDS, once called "the
grain of American humanist individualism and voluntaristic
associational action." This is the SDS of the Port Huron
Statement of 1962. This is the soul which animates the
thoughts of Tom Hayden:
"What would happen to bureaucracies if they had to be
understood by the people they are supposed to serve? What
would happen to banks and corporations if people wanted a
say over how they were operated? What would happen to
reformers and negotiators if their 'constituencies' decided to
speak for themselves? What would happen to schools if the
teachers questioned the kids about what is important to
know, and the kids answered back and dedided how to learn
it? What would happen to professors if poor people could
give lectures on poverty?"
There is another soul. It is found in the Progressive Labor
Party. Its philosophy is a collectivism based on centralized
power. Democratic centralism replaces the earlier SDS
organizational principle of participatory democracy. Straight
appearance and behavior replaces the vigorous counter
culture of the long-haired. The power politics of Progressive
Labor have brought inflexible dogmatism into SDS. Historian
Staughton Lynd now places his hopes in the Resistance, if it
can escape its original single-issue focus on the draft.
The news from Chicago seems to indicate that the SDS
regulars, by voting in caucus to expell the PL faction are
trying to return to the spirit expressed in the Port Huron
Statement: "We are aware of countering perhaps the domin
ant conception of man in the Twentieth Century: that he is
a thing to be manipulated, ancj that he is inherently incapable
of directing his own affairs." A humanistic viewpoint, with a
basic concern for the individual. This, of course, is directly
counter to the underlying nature of the PL: a completely
collectivist approach, where the goals and desires of the
individual are submerged.
We believe that this return to its founding principles is
vital for SDS, if it is to retain any degree of effectiveness. But
the regulars must remember that PL's success was due, in
large part to the failure of imagination of its opponents. PL's
influence on SDS was never obvious at Stanford because they
lacked adherents here. But PL's performance elsewhere leaves
little doubt that the regulars were accurate when PL passed
a resolution declaring that PL "was not a viable part of the
meaning of SDS."
