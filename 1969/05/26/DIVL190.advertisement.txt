THE SAGA OF SCLC
Since the Student Conduct Legislative Council (SCLC) has
existed, no rules have been passed by this lawmaking body
of the Community. Its short history has been marked by con
troversev and failure. These appear to be the relevant facts in
the chronology of SCLC.
ITEM As soon as SCLC was organized the legality of the
Student Representatives was questioned by a Faculty member
of SCLC The serious question involved was that the student
'members of the Council were not elected by a system of pro
portional representation, a requirement of the Charter. The
Academic Senate and the Administration were forced to accept
the student members: the question of illegality was never
brought up in the Student Legislature. LASSU simply ratified
the results of the election To force the issue, the Faculty mem
ber who questioned the legality of the student election re
signed from the Council, lie later withdrew his resignation so
th.it the Council could at least begin to function.
ITEM PhilipoTaubman. upon election as Editor of the STAN
FORD DAILY resigned from SCLC, pleading possible con
fl ct ot interest. The next student runner-up. who was not then
a reentered student, was introduced by the student members
of SCLC as 1 hil T .tubman s replacement. The question of il
legality of a student member again was raised because the
student Constitution clearly provides:
1 ) Only students . who possess a valid certificate of reg
istration shall be eligible to vote in anv election of the
Association, to be elected, or to hold office in the Asso
ciation. or to be otherwise representative of the students
of Stanford University. ( Article 1, Section 2).
2 ) No decision of a Board shall be valid if inconsistent with
this Constitution or its By-Laws. ( Article 111, Section 5).
This possible illegality delayed and concerned SCLC, but it
accepted the non-student in order to operate. The Speaker of
the Legislature pledged to both the Committee of Fifteen and
SCLC, that he would take up this question with the Student
Legislature. Clearly this was correct because the Student Con
stitution provided:
1 ) Supreme Legislative power in the Student Bodv shall be
vested in the Student Legislature ( Article 111, Section 1).
2 ) The Student Legislature shall have the following powers:
1 o interpret the Fundamental Standard, this Constitution
and its By-Laws (Article 111. Section 5. Subsection 0).
However, the Speaker of the Student Legislature never rais
ed the question of tlvs student's legalitv with the Student Legis
lature This student registered this quarter, subsequently drop
ping all course work. He is still a member of SCLC.
If elected 1 pledge myself to undo the damage done to our
Legislative-Judicial System. It is my desire to help establish
the SCLC as a respected source of law for the governance of
this Community.
TONY MARAN, Candidate for SCLC
