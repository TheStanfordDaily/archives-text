SAGA PART II
ITEM 1w o members of the Legislature, oik' a member of the
Committee of Fifteen, atempted to raise the question of the
students position on the SCLC; the Speaker
ruled them both out of order. Ou an appeal of that decision the
Speaker refused to put that appeal to a vote of the Legislature.
On a later motion to impeach the Speaker that evening, the
Speaker peremptorily adjourned the Legislature. The motion
to impeach was made by still another member of the Legisla
ture whose appeal of the Speaker's decision was ruled out of
order.
ITEM The Speaker of the Legislature subsequently filed
charges against the two students who attempted to raise the
simple question of legality of a non-registered student being a
member of SCLC I'pon investigation the Stanford Judicial
Council found these charges to be frivolous and without merit.
ITEM At a time when the Stanford Judicial Council (S|C)
was holding hearings to determine whether "extraordinary cir
cumstances' existed during the ALL sit-in that would justify
use of the residual powers of the President, the student mem
bers ol SCI.C apparently attempted to interfere with SIC. They
did this by representing at an SCI.C meeting the view that
there was an Administration "plot" against the students. These
students introduced a motion which in ellect could be inter
preted to limit the jurisdiction of the Stanford ludicial Council
and the I Diversity President. Tlrs motion was almost certainly
outside the jurisdiction of SCI.C but the Council passed it as
proposed legislation. No public hearings concerning this lcgis
laton were held.
Within minutes of passage, a student member of SCLC took
the proposal to the Stanford Judicial Council while it was in
session, and the hearings were interrupted. As proposed legis
lation Stanford Judicial Council was not required to observe
this proposed law. yet the purpose of the action was apparent:
to prejudice the hearings in progress at a time when the Com
munity was in turmoil.
If elected I pledge myself to undo the damage done to our
Legislative-Judicial System. It is my desire to help establish
the SCLC as a respected source of law for the governance of
this Community.
