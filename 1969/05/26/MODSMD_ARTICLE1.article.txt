# SRI Disclaims Tear Gas Link
## 
### 
Charges and countercharges are
flying in the wake of an article
published in last Friday's Daily that
claimed that Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) developed the
technology for aerosol dissemination of
CS tear gas an; the National Guard drew
upon that technology in last week's
Berkeley helicopter gas attack.
A response from SRI officials to the
article termed it "a blatant example of
malicious propaganda." The letter to
the editor from SRI Public Relations
Manager Homer Meaders and SRI
Physical Chemist William Thuman is
reprinted on page 2 of Today's Daily.
The officials questioned the
credentials of Daily associate editor
Michael Sweeney, who authored the
controversial article. Meaders is quoted
in Saturday's San Jose Mercury as
calling Sweeney a "liar," and declaring
that The Daily had sunk "to a new
journalistic low" by printing the article.
Solid Facts
In a statement released last night,
Daily editor Philip Taubman stated:
"Controversial investigatory reporting is
never greeted with open arms by those
being investigated and exposed. I did
not expect executives at SRI to be
pleased with Mr. Sweeney's article.

Their denials, however, seem hardly
credible in light of solid facts supporting
Mr. Sweeney's article."
Sweeney released the following
statement: "SRI is attempting to
cover-up their involvement in tear gas
and other chemical warfare. It won't
work. The evidence on SRl's work is
clear-cut, and the public can judge for
itself."
In another development, a scheduled
interview yesterday by The Daily of
Meaders and Thuman was cancelled by
Meaders because he felt it wouldn't be
productive.

Following a brief discussion with
several Daily editors Saturday, Thuman
agreed to a formal, taped interview.
Meaders was also agreeable, but later
phoned back to report that the
interview was cancelled because
Thuman felt he was getting boxed in by
people at The Daily, that he was being
pressed on insignificant technical
matters, and that because of the
classified nature of his work he would
be unable to respond to most questions.
The letter from Meaders and Thuman
disputed a number of facts in Sweeney's
article. They flatly stated at the outset
that "SRI has never done any work in
the aerial dissemination of chemical
agents."
They concluded with a blast at The
Daily for "consistently" allowing "its
news columns to be prostituted by
self-serving interest groups who
obviously have little regard for truth.
"Students on the Stanford campus,
whose fees support The Daily, certainly
deserve a better shake from you. How
about giving them some objective,
factual reporting for a change?" they
concluded.
Confusing The Issues
In a letter of response (also reprinted
on page 2), Daily editor Philip Taubman
charged the SRI officials with playing
"a game of semantics" to confuse the
issues.
Taubman charged that the basic
contention of Friday's article remains
unchallenged. Meaders and Thuman
cloud the issues, Taubman claimed, with
a refusal to acknowledge the use of
aerosol techniques in the aerial
dissemination of chemical agents.
♦
Claiming that SRI "is denying what
is obviously true," Taubman alleged
that "SRI is deeply afraid of the public
outcry against the Berkeley helicopter
gassing, so afraid that it has made a
calculated gamble to deny everything.
SRI believes that gamble will succeed
because so much of the evidence is
secret, and because SRI is putting all its
prestige on the line in denying the
ch^rres."

is obviously true," Taubman alleged
that "SRI is deeply afraid of the public
outcry against the Berkeley helicopter
gassing, so afraid that it has made a
calculated gamble to deny everything.
SRI believes that gamble will succeed
because so much of the evidence is
secret, and because SRI is putting all its
prestige on the line in denying the
ch^rres."

Details of SRl's work in chemical
agent dispersal methods is printed on
page 3 of today's DAILY.
Charges and countercharges are
flying in the wake of an article
published in last Friday's Daily that
claimed that Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) developed the
technology for aerosol dissemination of
CS tear gas an; the National Guard drew
upon that technology in last week's
Berkeley helicopter gas attack.
A response from SRI officials to the
article termed it "a blatant example of
malicious propaganda." The letter to
the editor from SRI Public Relations
Manager Homer Meaders and SRI
Physical Chemist William Thuman is
reprinted on page 2 of Today's Daily.
The officials questioned the
credentials of Daily associate editor
Michael Sweeney, who authored the
controversial article. Meaders is quoted
in Saturday's San Jose Mercury as
calling Sweeney a "liar," and declaring
that The Daily had sunk "to a new
journalistic low" by printing the article.
Solid Facts
In a statement released last night,
Daily editor Philip Taubman stated:
"Controversial investigatory reporting is
never greeted with open arms by those
being investigated and exposed. I did
not expect executives at SRI to be
pleased with Mr. Sweeney's article.

Their denials, however, seem hardly
credible in light of solid facts supporting
Mr. Sweeney's article."
Sweeney released the following
statement: "SRI is attempting to
cover-up their involvement in tear gas
and other chemical warfare. It won't
work. The evidence on SRl's work is
clear-cut, and the public can judge for
itself."
In another development, a scheduled
interview yesterday by The Daily of
Meaders and Thuman was cancelled by
Meaders because he felt it wouldn't be
productive.

Following a brief discussion with
several Daily editors Saturday, Thuman
agreed to a formal, taped interview.
Meaders was also agreeable, but later
phoned back to report that the
interview was cancelled because
Thuman felt he was getting boxed in by
people at The Daily, that he was being
pressed on insignificant technical
matters, and that because of the
classified nature of his work he would
be unable to respond to most questions.
The letter from Meaders and Thuman
disputed a number of facts in Sweeney's
article. They flatly stated at the outset
that "SRI has never done any work in
the aerial dissemination of chemical
agents."
They concluded with a blast at The
Daily for "consistently" allowing "its
news columns to be prostituted by
self-serving interest groups who
obviously have little regard for truth.
"Students on the Stanford campus,
whose fees support The Daily, certainly
deserve a better shake from you. How
about giving them some objective,
factual reporting for a change?" they
concluded.
Confusing The Issues
In a letter of response (also reprinted
on page 2), Daily editor Philip Taubman
charged the SRI officials with playing
"a game of semantics" to confuse the
issues.
Taubman charged that the basic
contention of Friday's article remains
unchallenged. Meaders and Thuman
cloud the issues, Taubman claimed, with
a refusal to acknowledge the use of
aerosol techniques in the aerial
dissemination of chemical agents.
