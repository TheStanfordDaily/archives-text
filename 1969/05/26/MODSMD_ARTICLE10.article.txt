The controversy over SRl's gas warfare
research raises two urgent issues: the social
responsibility of science, and the honesty
of SRI.
SRI has done research for the Army
Chemical Corps involving CS tear gas. That
fact is admitted by SRI. Yet on Saturday,
an SRI researcher who had worked in CBW
told three Daily reporters that he
personally disapproved of the use of CS
tear gas by a National Guard helicopter at
Berkeley on Tuesday.
Yet this man worked on the contract
which researched tear gas dispersion. Yet
he disapproves of an instance of its use.
And he would doubtlessly disapprove of
the use of more lethal nerve gas, biological
warfare, or other military techniques
researched by SRI.
How can this man -and countless other
military researchers in this
nation—reconcile the conflict between their
indifferent attitude toward the application
of their work and their disapproval of the
eventual uses of that research? One way to
avoid the conflict is to refuse to admit that
one's research was actually chemical
warfare. We see this approach in SRl's
letter on this page.
Many American scientists are taking a
more forthright stand. They are refusing to
work for mission-oriented Defense
agencies, and are banding together to
oppose chemical and biological warfare and
the anti-ballistic missile system. They have
realized that they cannot depend on some
abstract political process to save this nation
from militarism. They can only depend on
themselves. And they are acting.
Meanwhile, SRI acts like a blind man
that cannot see what the government does
with its research. The SRI researcher told
us he has no idea of what Edgewood
Arsenal does with his CBW reports; he just
sends them off. Perhaps SRI does not care
what happens to its research, but the rest
of the community does.
Can we trust SRI to do what it says it
will do? This issue deserves immediate
consideration by the Stanford community.
On May 13, the Trustees announced that
the SRI Board's Executive Committee had
announced it would "refuse to engage in
research projects dealing directly with the
development of weapons of biological or
chemical warfare."

Yet we have seen how limited a
coneeption SRI has of the uses of its CBW
research. SRI may even deny that it ever
did research "directly dealing with the
development of weapons" of CBW. They
would quibble over the phrase "directly
dealing," and they would quibble over the
words "development" and "weapons," and
meanwhile they would go'ahead and accept
contracts from the Edgewood Arsenal, with
innocent names like "Research Studies on
the Dissemination of Solid and Liquid
Agents." (Translation: tear gas and nerve
gas.)
In the near future, the Stanford
community won't even be in a position to
argue with SRI about what it does. The
Trustees have announced they are moving
with all deliberate speed to sever SRI from
the University, under terms of their
exclusive choosing. What guarantee will we
have then that SRI will not do CBW
research? Whatever decision has been made
by the SRI Executive Committee, they
would then certainly be in a position to
change their minds—in secret, so their
decision cannot be challenged.
This case brings home two vital reasons
why SRI must be retained, under
community control: first, can we trust SRI
to adhere to the spirit of any promises that
may be made; and second, assuming we can
accept their honesty, how can we allow
only SRI researchers to control the nature
of their work given their great disinterest in
its applications, as exemplified by the
attitude of the researcher we quoted
above?
The concern over what government
agencies will do with the discoveries passed
on to them by SRI has been expressed by
the community, and not by the
administrators—or by most researchers—at
SRI. Logically, therefore, we can expect no
one besides the community to put limits on
research at SRI, for the community is the
only body worried about the application of
research.
Such logic is not the kind that can be
understood by the Trustees. Ironically they
too are concerned with the applications of
SRl's work. But, unlike most of the
Stanford community, they are happy with
the results.
