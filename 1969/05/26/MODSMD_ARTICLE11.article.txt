# Sapir Column 'Slanderous'
## 
### 
I am outraged that you should permit a slanderous statement to be
published by your guest columnist, Marc Sapir, on May 23, 1969,
without at least verifying some of the elementary facts contained
therein. Though I could discuss both elements of his disjointed diatribe
against the Medical School and me, I shall concern myself only with
those comments directed at me. His statements directed toward the
suitability provisions of the proposed requirements for graduation from
Stanford Medical School can most appropriately be answered by other
members of the Committee on Courses and Curriculum and the
administrative officers of the Medical School.
The slanderous statement by Marc Sapir I refer to is, "As a result of
that incident I was almost failed in psychiatry . . The incident in
question is his public refusal to participate in a seminar run by a
psychiatrist who sits on the SJC. Mr. Sapir obviously implies that I
almost failed him in a course because of his or his wife's political beliefs
and activities. Since this is patently false, and since I refuse to be
intimidated in my legitimate activities as a teacher and as a member of
the Stanford faculty, I feel obligated to publicly state the facts in this
case.
I was preceptor for the seminar portion of the psychiatric clerkship
in February, 1969, of which Marc Sapir was one of eight members. In
the second meeting of an eight-session seminar, Mr. Sapir interrupted a
fellow student's clinical case presentation to attack my participation as
a member of the SJC. I suggested that because this was a didactic
session, only one of eight such sessions, that he defer this discussion
until the end of the meeting, when I would be happy to meet with him.
He persisted in his attack, become more vituperative and personal,
despite the fact that I pointed out to him he was taking class time away
from the other seven students. Therefore, I asked him to leave the room
and to meet me at the end of the session. He eventually complied with
my request to leave. However, he did not meet me at the end of the
session, nor did he attend any of the remaining sessions.
Since Mr. Sapir missed six of the eight required meetings, I felt that
his grade in the course, for which I was responsible, must rely heavily
on reports of his clinical performance with patients. I received reports
by two psychiatric residents (instructors) which indicated that he
performed satisfactorily in this clinical work with patients. On this
basis, I decided to give him a passing grade in the course. In a written
communication to the Medical School Dean's Office, a routine
procedure for all students, I explained his performance in the entire
course, including the fact that although he did not attend the didactic
portion of the course, his overall performance was such that he
deserved a passing grade.
Although it may be inconceivable to Mr. Sapir that I could and did
evaluate his clinical performance independently of both his person
animus towards me, and of his political activities in the community,
this is exactly what did transpire. It is especially unfortunate that Mr.
Sapir cannot discriminate between the personal and professional, since
this is one of the essential ingredients of a good physician.
I have deliberately detailed the facts in this case because of the harm
done both to faculty and students when irresponsible charges of
personal and/or political bias enter into the professor's evaluation of a
student's academic performance. In my view, the potential tyranny of
these charges is so enormous that it could bring the teaching function
of the faculty to an immediate halt. This attempt at intimidation
cannot go unanswered if academic freedom for both students and
faculty is to be maintained.
I hope other members of the Stanford community join me in this
resolve. The Editorial Staff of The Daily might well be the first.

I am outraged that you should permit a slanderous statement to be
published by your guest columnist, Marc Sapir, on May 23, 1969,
without at least verifying some of the elementary facts contained
therein. Though I could discuss both elements of his disjointed diatribe
against the Medical School and me, I shall concern myself only with
those comments directed at me. His statements directed toward the
suitability provisions of the proposed requirements for graduation from
Stanford Medical School can most appropriately be answered by other
members of the Committee on Courses and Curriculum and the
administrative officers of the Medical School.
The slanderous statement by Marc Sapir I refer to is, "As a result of
that incident I was almost failed in psychiatry . . The incident in
question is his public refusal to participate in a seminar run by a
psychiatrist who sits on the SJC. Mr. Sapir obviously implies that I
almost failed him in a course because of his or his wife's political beliefs
and activities. Since this is patently false, and since I refuse to be
intimidated in my legitimate activities as a teacher and as a member of
the Stanford faculty, I feel obligated to publicly state the facts in this
case.
I was preceptor for the seminar portion of the psychiatric clerkship
in February, 1969, of which Marc Sapir was one of eight members. In
the second meeting of an eight-session seminar, Mr. Sapir interrupted a
fellow student's clinical case presentation to attack my participation as
a member of the SJC. I suggested that because this was a didactic
session, only one of eight such sessions, that he defer this discussion
until the end of the meeting, when I would be happy to meet with him.
He persisted in his attack, become more vituperative and personal,
despite the fact that I pointed out to him he was taking class time away
from the other seven students. Therefore, I asked him to leave the room
and to meet me at the end of the session. He eventually complied with
my request to leave. However, he did not meet me at the end of the
session, nor did he attend any of the remaining sessions.
Since Mr. Sapir missed six of the eight required meetings, I felt that
his grade in the course, for which I was responsible, must rely heavily
on reports of his clinical performance with patients. I received reports
by two psychiatric residents (instructors) which indicated that he
performed satisfactorily in this clinical work with patients. On this
basis, I decided to give him a passing grade in the course. In a written
communication to the Medical School Dean's Office, a routine
procedure for all students, I explained his performance in the entire
course, including the fact that although he did not attend the didactic
portion of the course, his overall performance was such that he
deserved a passing grade.
Although it may be inconceivable to Mr. Sapir that I could and did
evaluate his clinical performance independently of both his person
animus towards me, and of his political activities in the community,
this is exactly what did transpire. It is especially unfortunate that Mr.
Sapir cannot discriminate between the personal and professional, since
this is one of the essential ingredients of a good physician.
I have deliberately detailed the facts in this case because of the harm
done both to faculty and students when irresponsible charges of
personal and/or political bias enter into the professor's evaluation of a
student's academic performance. In my view, the potential tyranny of
these charges is so enormous that it could bring the teaching function
of the faculty to an immediate halt. This attempt at intimidation
cannot go unanswered if academic freedom for both students and
faculty is to be maintained.
I hope other members of the Stanford community join me in this
resolve. The Editorial Staff of The Daily might well be the first.
