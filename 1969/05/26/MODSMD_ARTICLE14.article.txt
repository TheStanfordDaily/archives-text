# SRI: Defense And Prosecution
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily sank to a new
journalistic low Friday with the
lead article by Michael Sweeney in
which he attempted to implicate
SRI in the helicopter tear-gas
spraying at Berkeley. The fact
that Mr. Sweeney is a leader in the
ASM hardly qualifies him as a
factual reporter, and we were
surprised that the Daily would
publish as a news article such a
blatant example of malicious
propaganda.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said SRI has done "extensive
work on the technique of aerial
spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard" at Berkeley.
He was told that SRI has never
done any work in the aerial
dissemination of chemical agents.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said SRI had a "large, secret"
contract from Edgewood Arsenal.
He was told that project was
unclassified and, in fact, had in his
possession portions of the project
report itself.
Mr. Sweeney was doubly
(perhaps triply) false when he
quoted from Seymour Hersh's
book "Chemical and Biological
Warfare." Mr. Sweeney admitted
to Mr. Meaders Friday, in the
presence of two Daily reporters,
that he had never seen a copy of
Mr. Hersh's book. Yet Mr.
Sweeney quotes this book as
saying SRI developed nozzles for
the "aerial spraying of nerve gas."
The fact is, SRI has never
developed nozzles for the aerial
spraying of any chemical warfare
agent, and has never developed
nozzles for spraying nerve gas
from any location. Mr. Hersh's
book refers to SRI on pages 42,
235, 239, 248, 249-50, and 258.
Nowhere in the book does in
mention SRI in connection with
either nozzles or nerve gas.
No Mention
Hersh's book has been quoted
by members of A3M as blaming
an SRI-developed nozzle for the
death of a number of sheep near
Dugway Proving Ground in
Nevada. The truth is, Hersh's
book was published prior to this
incident and there is no mention
of the incident in the book.

SRI was in no way involved
with the Dugway incident, either
directly or indirectly. Another
example of the "by any means
necessary" tactics employed by
certain A3M activists.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said a current SRI project "is
specifically intended to develop
means for the Army to spread CS
over swamps and other wet areas
in Vietnam." In fact, this project
is a small study of the statistical
distribution of sizes of particles in
a hydrophobic (i.e.
water-repellent) powder. Our
study is trying to find out about
the range of sizes of the individual
particles. Mr. Sweeney was told
this, but chose not to print it.
Some researchers have
postulated the possibility that
hydrophobic powders might be
used to maintain on the ground
for extended periods many types
of chemicals. Conceivably, CS in
such a form might be so
distributed as to deny access to a
given area to anyone not
protected by a gas mask.
Similarly, pesticides might be
maintained on the surface of
water to kill water-breeding pests
such as mosquite larvae for
extended periods. None of SRl's
research involves either of these
applications.
Distorting
I am assuming that your
printer or copy reader was
responsible for the error which
gave $2.5 billion as the value of a
contract which actually amounted
to $2.4 million. (Yes, it was a
typo-Ed.)
SRI has never denied doing
research in dissemination
techniques for chemical agents.
Copies of our final report on the
large project, which ended in
1967, are available from the
appropriate governmental
agencies. Why, then, does the
A3M persist in distorting what
factual information they bother
to obtain and manufacturing out
of whole cloth the rest of the
propaganda?
Is the Stanford Daily a
newspaper or a propaganda organ
for the A3M? Is no attempt made
to have news articles written by

persons without obvious bias,
reserving personal opinion and
distortions for signed columns?
How long will the Daily continue
to rely on news reports from
dedicated activists giving their
versions of incidents in which
they acted as participants and not
as observers?
Prostituted
Even more to the point, why
does a student newspaper
supported by all the students at
Stanford consistently allow its
news columns to be prostituted
by self-serving interest groups
who obviously have little regard
for the truth?
Students on the Stanford
campus, whose fees support the
Daily, certainly deserve a better
shake from you. How about giving
them some objective, factual
reporting for a change?

hydrophobic powders might be
used to maintain on the ground
for extended periods many types
of chemicals. Conceivably, CS in
such a form might be so
distributed as to deny access to a
given area to anyone not
protected by a gas mask.
Similarly, pesticides might be
maintained on the surface of
water to kill water-breeding pests
such as mosquite larvae for
extended periods. None of SRl's
research involves either of these
applications.
Distorting
I am assuming that your
printer or copy reader was
responsible for the error which
gave $2.5 billion as the value of a
contract which actually amounted
to $2.4 million. (Yes, it was a
typo-Ed.)
SRI has never denied doing
research in dissemination
techniques for chemical agents.
Copies of our final report on the
large project, which ended in
1967, are available from the
appropriate governmental
agencies. Why, then, does the
A3M persist in distorting what
factual information they bother
to obtain and manufacturing out
of whole cloth the rest of the
propaganda?
Is the Stanford Daily a
newspaper or a propaganda organ
for the A3M? Is no attempt made
to have news articles written by

persons without obvious bias,
reserving personal opinion and
distortions for signed columns?
How long will the Daily continue
to rely on news reports from
dedicated activists giving their
versions of incidents in which
they acted as participants and not
as observers?
Prostituted
Even more to the point, why
does a student newspaper
supported by all the students at
Stanford consistently allow its
news columns to be prostituted
by self-serving interest groups
who obviously have little regard
for the truth?
Students on the Stanford
campus, whose fees support the

shake from you. How about giving
them some objective, factual
reporting for a change?

SRI
Editor, THE DAILY:
The Daily sank to a new
journalistic low Friday with the
lead article by Michael Sweeney in
which he attempted to implicate
SRI in the helicopter tear-gas
spraying at Berkeley. The fact
that Mr. Sweeney is a leader in the
ASM hardly qualifies him as a
factual reporter, and we were
surprised that the Daily would
publish as a news article such a
blatant example of malicious
propaganda.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said SRI has done "extensive
work on the technique of aerial
spraying of CS tear gas used by
the National Guard" at Berkeley.
He was told that SRI has never
done any work in the aerial
dissemination of chemical agents.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said SRI had a "large, secret"
contract from Edgewood Arsenal.
He was told that project was
unclassified and, in fact, had in his
possession portions of the project
report itself.
Mr. Sweeney was doubly
(perhaps triply) false when he
quoted from Seymour Hersh's
book "Chemical and Biological
Warfare." Mr. Sweeney admitted
to Mr. Meaders Friday, in the
presence of two Daily reporters,
that he had never seen a copy of
Mr. Hersh's book. Yet Mr.
Sweeney quotes this book as
saying SRI developed nozzles for
the "aerial spraying of nerve gas."
The fact is, SRI has never
developed nozzles for the aerial
spraying of any chemical warfare
agent, and has never developed
nozzles for spraying nerve gas
from any location. Mr. Hersh's
book refers to SRI on pages 42,
235, 239, 248, 249-50, and 258.
Nowhere in the book does in
mention SRI in connection with
either nozzles or nerve gas.
No Mention
Hersh's book has been quoted
by members of A3M as blaming
an SRI-developed nozzle for the
death of a number of sheep near
Dugway Proving Ground in
Nevada. The truth is, Hersh's
book was published prior to this
incident and there is no mention
of the incident in the book.

SRI was in no way involved
with the Dugway incident, either
directly or indirectly. Another
example of the "by any means
necessary" tactics employed by
certain A3M activists.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said a current SRI project "is
specifically intended to develop
means for the Army to spread CS
over swamps and other wet areas
in Vietnam." In fact, this project
is a small study of the statistical
distribution of sizes of particles in
a hydrophobic (i.e.
water-repellent) powder. Our
study is trying to find out about
the range of sizes of the individual
particles. Mr. Sweeney was told
this, but chose not to print it.

unclassified and, in fact, had in his
possession portions of the project
report itself.
Mr. Sweeney was doubly
(perhaps triply) false when he
quoted from Seymour Hersh's
book "Chemical and Biological
Warfare." Mr. Sweeney admitted
to Mr. Meaders Friday, in the
presence of two Daily reporters,
that he had never seen a copy of
Mr. Hersh's book. Yet Mr.
Sweeney quotes this book as
saying SRI developed nozzles for
the "aerial spraying of nerve gas."
The fact is, SRI has never
developed nozzles for the aerial
spraying of any chemical warfare
agent, and has never developed
nozzles for spraying nerve gas
from any location. Mr. Hersh's
book refers to SRI on pages 42,
235, 239, 248, 249-50, and 258.
Nowhere in the book does in
mention SRI in connection with
either nozzles or nerve gas.
No Mention
Hersh's book has been quoted
by members of A3M as blaming
an SRI-developed nozzle for the
death of a number of sheep near
Dugway Proving Ground in
Nevada. The truth is, Hersh's
book was published prior to this
incident and there is no mention
of the incident in the book.

SRI was in no way involved
with the Dugway incident, either
directly or indirectly. Another
example of the "by any means
necessary" tactics employed by
certain A3M activists.
Mr. Sweeney was false when he
said a current SRI project "is
specifically intended to develop
means for the Army to spread CS
over swamps and other wet areas
in Vietnam." In fact, this project
is a small study of the statistical
distribution of sizes of particles in
a hydrophobic (i.e.
water-repellent) powder. Our
study is trying to find out about
the range of sizes of the individual
particles. Mr. Sweeney was told
this, but chose not to print it.
Some researchers have
postulated the possibility that
hydrophobic powders might be
used to maintain on the ground
for extended periods many types
of chemicals. Conceivably, CS in
such a form might be so
distributed as to deny access to a
given area to anyone not
protected by a gas mask.
Similarly, pesticides might be
maintained on the surface of
water to kill water-breeding pests
such as mosquite larvae for
extended periods. None of SRl's
research involves either of these
applications.
Distorting
I am assuming that your
printer or copy reader was
responsible for the error which
gave $2.5 billion as the value of a
contract which actually amounted
to $2.4 million. (Yes, it was a
typo-Ed.)
SRI has never denied doing
research in dissemination
techniques for chemical agents.
Copies of our final report on the
large project, which ended in
1967, are available from the
appropriate governmental
agencies. Why, then, does the
A3M persist in distorting what
factual information they bother
to obtain and manufacturing out
of whole cloth the rest of the
propaganda?
Is the Stanford Daily a
newspaper or a propaganda organ
for the A3M? Is no attempt made
to have news articles written by

persons without obvious bias,
reserving personal opinion and
distortions for signed columns?
How long will the Daily continue
to rely on news reports from
dedicated activists giving their
versions of incidents in which
they acted as participants and not
as observers?
Prostituted
Even more to the point, why
does a student newspaper
supported by all the students at
Stanford consistently allow its
news columns to be prostituted
by self-serving interest groups
who obviously have little regard
for the truth?
Students on the Stanford
campus, whose fees support the
Daily, certainly deserve a better
shake from you. How about giving
them some objective, factual
reporting for a change?
