Besides the crude attempts to
slander Michael Sweeney and The
Daily, the most remarkable aspect
of Messrs. Meadersand Thuman's
letter is that it does not deny in
any way the contention of
Friday's article: namely that SRI
developed the technology for
aerosol dissemination of CS tear
gas and that the National Guard
helicopter drew upon that
technology in Berkeley last week.
The Meaders-Thuman letter is
trying to argue that SRI never did
experiments in aerial or airborne
dissemination, and therefore is
blameless. Note that they never
deny having done aerosol
research. They seem to be arguing
that aerial techniques are not
equal to aerosol methods. They
play a game of semantics in the
face of brutally clear facts: a
spokesman for the National Guard
stated last week that the
helicopter used "an aerosol type

of arrangement." In other words,
aerosol equipment was placed on
the helicopter and thus became
aerial dissemination equipment.
(See p. 3 for an article with details
of SRl's work.)
Here are the answers to other
points in the SRI letter:
1. The letter's contention
(paragraph 2> that SRI has "never
done any work in the aerial
dissemination of chemical agents"
is blatantly false, particularly
regarding nerve gas (see p. 3 of
today's Daily.)
2. SRl's CBW contracts are
"secret" in these ways: (1) many
researchers must have security
clearances to work on them, and
(2) much, if not all, of the
published research output is not
available to anyone besides CBW
researchers. According to the
present definitions used by the
Stanford faculty, this means such
contracts are "secret." SRI and
the Pentagon may call the
contract "unclassified," but that
is merely for public relations
purposes. As Seymour Hersh
points out in Chemical and
Biological Warfare (p. 225) "for
all practical purposes, most
Pentagon (CBW) projects are
secret but unclassified . .
3. Mr. Sweeney's citation of
Seymour Hersh's book about the
Dugway incident was copied from
the SRI Coalition's pamphlet,
"SRI," which was in error. We
apologize to our readers and to
Mr. Hersh for the mistake. But we
have no apology whatsoever to
SRI, which has done research in
nerve gas, nozzles, and aerosol
dispersion, as documented on p. 3
of today's Daily. Therefore SRI
was very much "involved" in the
Army's nerve gas program at
Dugway and elsewhere.
4. SRI denies that its current
chemical warfare project is related
to tear gas. Yet as reported in the
Daily and other newspapers, an
SRI researcher stood up at a
forum in Memorial Auditorium on
February 6 and said he objected
to working on this project because
it involved tear gas applications.
Moreover, tiie contract
description says it concerns
"explosive dissemination" of

powders like CS, which is what
bombs and gernades do. And
finally, the project is sponsored
by the Army's Edgewood Arsenal,
whose mission is the development
of CBW weapons.
5. SRI claims that we can ask
the government for copies of CBW
research reports. (SRI itself
refused to give us copies.) The
fact is that Edgewood Arsenal will
not release to the public anything
that has not had all relevant CBW
information edited out. But we'll
take up SRI on its bluff and ask
Edgewood for unedited copies of
all reports from SRI contract
DA-18-03 5-AMC-122(A), and
we'll let you know what happens.
Why is SRI denying what is
obviously true? SRI is deeply
afraid of the public outcry against
the Berkeley helicopter gassing, so
afraid that it has made a
calculated gamble to deny
everything. SRI believes that
gamble will succeed because so j
much of the evidence is secret,
and because SRI is putting all its
prestige on the line in denying the
charges. Also, SRI believes that
the technical aspects of tear gas
and nerve gas dispersion are J
beyond the grasp of the general
public, so that they cannot judge
for themselves the extent of SRl's
involvement.

3. Mr. Sweeney's citation of
Seymour Hersh's book about the
Dugway incident was copied from
the SRI Coalition's pamphlet,
"SRI," which was in error. We
apologize to our readers and to
Mr. Hersh for the mistake. But we
have no apology whatsoever to
SRI, which has done research in
nerve gas, nozzles, and aerosol
dispersion, as documented on p. 3
of today's Daily. Therefore SRI
was very much "involved" in the
Army's nerve gas program at
Dugway and elsewhere.
4. SRI denies that its current
chemical warfare project is related
to tear gas. Yet as reported in the
Daily and other newspapers, an
SRI researcher stood up at a
forum in Memorial Auditorium on
February 6 and said he objected
to working on this project because
it involved tear gas applications.
Moreover, tiie contract
description says it concerns
"explosive dissemination" of

powders like CS, which is what
bombs and gernades do. And
finally, the project is sponsored
by the Army's Edgewood Arsenal,
whose mission is the development
of CBW weapons.
5. SRI claims that we can ask
the government for copies of CBW
research reports. (SRI itself
refused to give us copies.) The
fact is that Edgewood Arsenal will
not release to the public anything
that has not had all relevant CBW
information edited out. But we'll
take up SRI on its bluff and ask
Edgewood for unedited copies of
all reports from SRI contract
DA-18-03 5-AMC-122(A), and
we'll let you know what happens.
Why is SRI denying what is
obviously true? SRI is deeply
afraid of the public outcry against
the Berkeley helicopter gassing, so
afraid that it has made a
calculated gamble to deny
everything. SRI believes that
gamble will succeed because so j
much of the evidence is secret,
and because SRI is putting all its
prestige on the line in denying the
charges. Also, SRI believes that
the technical aspects of tear gas
and nerve gas dispersion are J
beyond the grasp of the general
public, so that they cannot judge
for themselves the extent of SRl's
involvement.

Besides the crude attempts to
slander Michael Sweeney and The
Daily, the most remarkable aspect
of Messrs. Meadersand Thuman's
letter is that it does not deny in
any way the contention of
Friday's article: namely that SRI
developed the technology for
aerosol dissemination of CS tear
gas and that the National Guard
helicopter drew upon that
technology in Berkeley last week.
The Meaders-Thuman letter is
trying to argue that SRI never did
experiments in aerial or airborne
dissemination, and therefore is
blameless. Note that they never
deny having done aerosol
research. They seem to be arguing
that aerial techniques are not
equal to aerosol methods. They
play a game of semantics in the
face of brutally clear facts: a
spokesman for the National Guard
stated last week that the
helicopter used "an aerosol type

of arrangement." In other words,
aerosol equipment was placed on
the helicopter and thus became
aerial dissemination equipment.
(See p. 3 for an article with details
of SRl's work.)
Here are the answers to other
points in the SRI letter:
1. The letter's contention
(paragraph 2> that SRI has "never
done any work in the aerial
dissemination of chemical agents"
is blatantly false, particularly
regarding nerve gas (see p. 3 of
today's Daily.)
2. SRl's CBW contracts are
"secret" in these ways: (1) many
researchers must have security
clearances to work on them, and
(2) much, if not all, of the
published research output is not
available to anyone besides CBW
researchers. According to the
present definitions used by the
Stanford faculty, this means such
contracts are "secret." SRI and
the Pentagon may call the
contract "unclassified," but that
is merely for public relations
purposes. As Seymour Hersh
points out in Chemical and
Biological Warfare (p. 225) "for
all practical purposes, most
Pentagon (CBW) projects are
secret but unclassified . .
