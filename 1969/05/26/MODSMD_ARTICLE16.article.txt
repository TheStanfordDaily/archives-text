# Black Belt
## Judo At Stanford 
### 
Unknown to most of the
Stanford community, an
unprecedented event occurred in
the history of Stanford athletics
on Sunday, May 18. The occasion
was a Judo Promotional
Tournament held in the men's
gym under the auspices of the
Central Coast Judo Black Belt
Association, of which Stanford
Judo Club is a member. In the
tournament, Brian Koch, a
sophomore from Mercer Island,
Washington, won all his three
matches to earn the degree of
"Shodan," or first degree black
belt. He is the first "jodoka"
(judoist) to begin his training in
judo here at Stanford and attain
this coveted rank.
For Coach Tamo Kitaura, or
"Sensei" (instructor), this was the
climax of his efforts in teaching
judo at Stanford since its

founding over six years ago. The
fact that one of his raw recruit
from Stanford has earned the
"shodan" degree, which is highly
prized even in Japan, attest to his
skill in teaching the gentle, but
precise, art of judo.
