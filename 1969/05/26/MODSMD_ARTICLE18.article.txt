## Top Tribe Play Falls Short 
### 
It's not too often that a
baseball team wins 8 of its last 9
league ball games (12 of 13
overall) and still fails to win a
championship, but that's exactly
what happened to Coach Ray
Young's Indians this year.

'I'he Tribe went into the last
two weeks of the season tied for
first place in the Pacific-8 with
three other teams, all four clubs
having 8-4 records. The Indians
caught fire and lost only one ball
game the rest of the way, a 4-3

verdict to Oregon, but it cost
them the championship. UCLA's
Bruins won their last 12 straight
to take the title with a 17-4 mark.
The Tribe wound up 16-5.
During the past three years the
Indians have compiled the finest
record of any team in the
Pacific-8 in league play. In that
span the Tribe has chalked up 37
conference victories against 11
losses and 2 ties. Overall the
Indians' three-year mark is a
fantastic 106-30-2.
Three year varsity veterans Bob
Boone, Mark Marquess, Rod
Poteete and Ron Shoots closed
out their careers last weekend.
For Boone and Marquess, the
team's co-captains, it was a fitting
farewell. Boone pitched the
Indians to a 9-4 victory in
Friday's contest, striking out 7
and walking none while allowing
but four hits. Marquess' two-run
triple up the alley in left center
was the highlight of the game.
Boone, certain to be an
All-American this year, wound up
the team's leading hitter at .311
(.370 in league). The
multi-talented third
baseman-pitcher wound up the
1969 campaign with a brilliant 9-1
record and 1.27 ERA. Bob
completed 8 of the 10 games he
started this year, including 5 of 5
in league play. Marquess, an
All-American the past two years,
fell off a little at the plate to .294,
but led the team in runs scored
(38), triples (6), and stolen bases
(13).
UCLA's Jim York finished as
the league's top pitcher with an
0.45 ERA with three other Bruin
pitchers finishing among the top
six in the conference.
Stanford's Phil Keller was the
pitching strikeout leader with 64
in 58-1/3 innings, also a new Pac-8
record.
