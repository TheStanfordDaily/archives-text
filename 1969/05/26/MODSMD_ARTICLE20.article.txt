## Hockey Continues 
### 
The Stanford Ice Hockey Club
held a wrap-up meeting Thursday
night at TVesidder Memorial
Union on the campus. The Club,
believed to be the first Indian
hockey team in history, finished
the season with a 3-5 won-and-lost
record in exhibition play.
A major problem throughout
the year was the lack of
consistency. Although the
individual skills were obvious to
the two or three dozen faithful
supporters of the team, only
rarely were the Cards able to put
it all together in an agressive
performance from start to finish.
For example, in a recent game
against the San Francisco Senior
Hockey Club, the Stanford six got
behind by the score of 10-1
bef ore they seemed to warm up.
In the third period, however,
they came back with a rush and
nearly blew San Francisco off the
ice, only to bow finally, 11-7.
Perhaps the acquisition of a
non-playing coachâ€”a top priority
item during the coming
off-season will help to cure this
problem.
At last night's meeting the
Club voted to accept an invitation
to become a charter member of
the Bay Area Hockey League. As
presently constituted the loop has
four members, but there are four
more teams that may join before
the season starts.

The Stanford Club also elected
officers for the coming year. Bob
Kadlec, a left wing and graduate
student in Aeronautical
Engineering, was named President.
Others elected were
undergraduate wing "Flip"
O ianos, Vice-President, center
Hugh Tirell from the Business
School, Secretary; and chemistry
grad and goalie Dick Jones,
treasurer.
The team necessarily is
composed mostly of transplanted
Easterners and mid-Westerners.
But the hope is that a vigorous
recruiting and publicity campaign,
aided by support from the
Athletic Department and
Administration, will be able to sell
tnis exciting game to the Stanford
community.
