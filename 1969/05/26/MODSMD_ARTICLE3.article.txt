# University Must Survive
## Commager Hits Relevancy 
### EILEEN HALEY 
"The notion that only Stokely
Carmicheal or Prof. Marcuse are relevant
flies in the face of the whole history of
learning," stated Dr. Henry Steele
Commager, noted American historian
and author, during his speech before
300 people last Thursday.
Entitled "The Crisis in the
University," his speech's main thrust
was toward a clear conception of the
university's role in society.
Commager feels that the university
should not be involved in society's
current problems, not should it try to
be relevant.
He labelled students who demanded
these committments of the University
"misguided" and warned that they were
attacking the "purest" institution in our

country. As to solutions to current
problems, Commager advocated
working through politics.
High School Treatment
One of his strongest criticisms of
present day universities was what he
called the "tyranny of courses."
According to Commager, "Giving
courses in everything is the way the
university treats college students like
they were still in high school."
"We have corrupted students by
persuading them they cannot learn
anything except by taking courses," he
continued.
Commager remarked, "It is not the
business of the university to be relevant
in the sense that the newspapers or
television is relevant." He pointed out
that "the university is relevant as it is

involved in the past and the future of
mankind."
The university has obligations to
society, according to Commager, but he
emphasized that the most important of
these is to the "heritage of learning"
and to "long range problems," "not to
current war or plans, but the larger
academic and intellectual enterprise."
Individual Commitment
As an institution, the university
should not be involved in solving social
ills, according to Commager. However,
he lauded individuals within the
university who committed themselves to
improving the world. As far as
cooperating with the government,
Commager declared that the university
"is not a passive agent, it must have the
right to exercise judgment, moral and
intellectual."
Referring to the wave of "student
protest everywhere in the world,"
Commager noted that it indicates that
students "no longer have confidence in
government, politics, church, or
industry," and only the university is
left.
However, he feels that student
demonstrators are missing the point in
"attacking the most liberal" institution
in the country. Rather they should start
at the heart of the problem, not at the
margins, and "work through politics."
In answer to a question about
war-related research, Commager said
that the university should say no to all
such research, but warned that there
was no instance where violence has
speeded up this process.
