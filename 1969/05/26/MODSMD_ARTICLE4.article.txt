# Individual As A Social Unit
## Loneliness: A Stanford Problem? 
### SUSAN SWARD 
There are many students at Stanford
University today who feel that Stanford
prior to the mid-1960's was a harbor for
the rich playboys and playgirls of the
West Coast. The student body
allegedly frolicked at the fraternity
beer drinking parties, capsized sailboats
on Lake Lagunita on windy spring
afternoons, and generally led a carefree,
unaware life.
Whatever the merits of this legend, it
is widely accepted that Stanford
today—for whatever reasons—is not the
institution it was in the 50's. Given this
generally acknowledged evolution in the
character of the student body toward a
more aware, politically conscious
outlook on the world, several observers
of campus life have turned their
attention to the psychological make-up
of the Stanford student today in an
effort to evaluate "the new breed on the
farm."

One question frequently asked by
Stanford psychologists and laymen alike
is: "Are the students here plagued with
a feeling of loneliness?"
Loneliness Defined
The emotion of loneliness is defined
by Dr. David Dorosin, head of
psychiatry at Stanford's Health Center,
as an individual's sense that he is making
the journey through life alone, with a
doubt that his personally valued self
might be valued by others.
At first glance, Stanford might
appear to be an institution that is not
prone to loneliness. The hustle and
bustle of people moving to and fro
across the university's quad, the central
meeting places of Tresidder Union and
the new coffee house, and the relative
economic-social homogeneity of the
student body are all factors that would
seemingly detract from the student's
inclination toward loneliness.
Opinion and research on the question
of loneliness at Stanford indicate that
Stanford students are more lonely than
the casual observer of campus life might
expect.
While many individuals in the college
community may maintain that Stanford
is often a lonely place to live and work,
the great majority of these individuals
are careful to state that they do not feel
that Stanford is unique among college
campuses in this respect. A distinction is
also often made between feeling lonely
and being alone.
Dr. David Dorosin, who sees many
Stanford students personally for
therapy, is one of those individuals who
prefers to speak of loneliness as a
phenomenon experienced by college
students generally rather than by
Stanford students particularly.
Loneliness To Be Expected
A certain sense of loneliness is to be
expected during the college years,
according to Dr. Dorosin. In this period
of life the college student is testing
himself in new ways. He is no longer
clearly a member of the family that
brought him up, and he does not yet
have a family of his own in most cases
or other social relations which affirm his
valued self. Instead, it is the individual
who is the unit during college.
Dorosin, who has been at the Health
Center for one year and was at the
Stanford Medical Center for five years
before that, hopes to expand contact
between the residence system and"the
Health Center psychiatric services in the
years to come. Presently the psychiatric
service does no active proselytizing to
attract patients and instead relies on an
informal grapevine to announce the
availability of therapy for students.
The psychiatric service currently
treats about nine percent of the student
body yearly. Though the number of
patients has risen over recent years, it is

not clear that the rise is due to increased
severity of problems among Stanford
students, according to Dorosin.
Assistant Dean of Students, Bill
Wyman, believes that the housing
shortage and the lack of a refined
intellectual elite are both principal
contributors to an atmosphere of
loneliness on campus. Encounter groups
and student power organizations have
filled some of the existing void because
these activities give students a sense of
participating in a relevant concern,
Wyman feels.
The position of young faculty
members is one that is prone to
loneliness, Wyman believes. These a'p
the men whose very survival in thf
academic world often depends on
writing a book that they do not want to
write and that no one wants to read.
Students often turn against young
faculty very viciously, Wyman notes,
when faculty and student thinking do
not coincide.
Center Study
The Counseling and Testing Center is
another organization on campus that
concerns itself with the problem of
loneliness. In 1967 the Center issued
two reports subsumed under the title
"The Stanford Community As Seen By
Students —Scholarly, Aware and
Lonely."
Both studies were conducted by the
Center and were compiled from the
responses in "two carefully selected
representative samples of upperclassmen
on nearly 600 items."
Dr. John D. Black, Director of the
Center, said that the reports indicated
that "Stanford is a highly intellectual
and scholarly institution but is deficient
in its sense of community and in
providing the opportunity for satisfying
human relationships."
Katz Study
Dr. Joseph Katz, Director of the
Human Problems Institute, edited a
report on "Growth and Restraint in
College Students" in 1967 that sampled
over 3,000 Berkeley and Stanford
undergraduates. Katz commented on
the report,
"In spite of all the arrangements that
look favorable for people meeting each
other at Stanford, there is a good deal
of loneliness on the campus. Activities
need to be.done together."
Katz felt that one specific statistic
supported the observations that
Stanford is a lonely place: twenty five
percent of senior women here do not
date, even though the male-to-female
ratio for the whole student body is
about 4-1.
One other major study within the
university that has focused part of its
attention on this question is the Study
of Education at Stanford, an attempt at
self-study of the university bv p series of

administration - faculty-student
committees.
Norton Batkin 111, the only
undergraduate on the study's Steering
Committee, feels that the study's results
do relate to the question of loneliness
on the campus.
The study's impact on the question
of loneliness may be felt in two ways,
Batkin notes. The report's
recommendations may act to decrease
loneliness by taking some of the
emphasis away from academic
competition. For loneliness here is not a
function of physical separation as much
as it is a function of intellectual,
moti ational separation, Batkin feels.
C.l the other hand, the
lecoi lmendations may possibly increase
the student's sense of loneliness by
telling him to take more responsibility
for his own actions. As a person takes
on more responsibility, he usually
becomes more alone, Batkin feels.
Lonely Students?
Whatever the experts at Stanford say
about the problem of loneliness,
Stanford students seem to agree that
loneliness is an

ROLL CALL-Seventy*five persons marched silently Friday from the All Saints Episcopal
Church in Palo Alio to Cogswell Park to mourn all the dead in Vietnam. They began reading
the names of 35,000 American servicemen who have been killed since l%l at 8 a.m. It was
expected that the reading would take 18 hours. The group carried signs that read. "Stop the
War not the Job Corps" and "We are destroying a country and its People" and included
several clergymen and nuns. The march and the reading began peacefully and without
incident.
