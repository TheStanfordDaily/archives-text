# Guard Begins Berkeley Exit
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
The National Guard began pulling
out of Berkeley over the weekend after
the city council voted 8-1 Saturday
afternoon to ask Governor Reagan to
lift the strict "state of emergency"
regulations imposed May 22 when street
violence erupted over a "People's Park."
The council's request came during a
day-long meeting which was called to
hear citizens' viewpoints. Some 80
persons spoke before a capacity
audience in the council chambers.
Yesterday afternoon, demonstrators
held a memorial service lor James
Rector, who was slain by police on May
22, and then marched to vacant area at
Grant and Hearst Streets in Berkeley
and began working on a "People's Park
Annex."
The land, which is owned by the Bay
Area Rapid Transit Authority (BART)
and lies over a recently completed
BART tunnel, was quickly covered with
sod and planted with trees, flowers and
bushes.
Playground equipment was installed
and a fire was built which was'used to
cook dinner.

Up to presstime, police had taken no
action against the new park.
Resolution Passed
A resolution was also passed at the
council meeting which instructed
Alameda County Sheriff Frank I.
Madigan to investigate charges of
brutality at the Santa Rita
Rehabilitation Center, where more than
500 arrested demonstrators were
housed.
U.S. District Court Judge Robert H.
Pecham, acting on complaints of Santa
Rit a prisoners, issued a restraining order
Saturday prohibiting further abuses at
the facility.
A San Francisco Chronicle reporter
who was one of those arrested in the
mass arrest on Thursday, reported that
over 200 prisoners were forced to lay
face down on graveled asphalt for two
and a half hours, and were beaten by
guards if they moved or spoke.
Prisoners Beaten
He also described the beating of
several prisoners while they were being
searched for the third time before being
fingerprinted.
The reporter also explained how the
guards repeatedly entered the barracks
threatening the prisoners, issuing
contradictory orders and preventing
anyone from sleeping.
On Friday, the Academic Senate of
the University of California voted
overwhelmingly in favor of a resolution
urging that the cyclone fence that the
University had put up around People's
Park be removed.
Troop Withdrawal Urged
By a vote of 642 to 95, the Senate
urged the immediate withdrawal of
troops and police from the campus and
for investigations by the State Attorney
General and the U.S. Department of
Justice "into the police and military
lawlessness committed in the past eight
days in the name of maintaining law and
order."
While the faculty were meeting,
students tried to march from the
campus to Telegraph Avenue. They
were turned back by police using tear
gas and clubs. Twelve persons were
arrested and an Associated Press
photographer was clubbed by a
Berkeley Police Sargeant while trying to
Lake photographs of the arrests. Two
other photographers had their cameras
damaged by the same officer.
On Saturday, about 600
demonstrators gathered in a park across
the street from the city hall, where the
city council was meeting. They
remained in the park for almost an hour
throwing frisbees, blowing whistles and
snapping crickets, before heading up to
the nearby Shattuck Ave. business
district to begin the "shop-in" which
leaflets called for as part of a general
boycott of all Berkeley business.
Police made at least three arrests
before the order to disperse was given
from a police car. A man and his wife
were among the first arrested as they
shopped inside a dry goods store on
Shattuck. No reason for their arrest was
apparent.
