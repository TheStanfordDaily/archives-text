# Pitzer Relates Actions To Alumni Assembly
## 
### 
At last Saturday's Alumni Assembly,
University President Kenneth Pitzer
reacted to student activism this quarter,
and the Alumni praised the general
manner in which campus problems have
been handled.
Hundreds of young men and women
want to take action "to help remedy as
quickly as possible the problems of the
world about them," Pitzer said. But a
"new morality" has led to excesses.

"It has been used to justify illegal
actions by some individuals," Pitzer
said. "The argument being that a
minority that is clearly 'right' can
dictate with impunity to a majority that
is clearly 'wrong.' Thus a little evil is
permissible in order to eradicate a
greater evil."
This dangerous precedent has given
rise to a strong reaction, he continued:
"The wave of self-defined morality
swept demonstrators into the illegal
occupation of two buildings, and the
opposition to coercion solidified."
"Obviously, Stanford is not as
serene, or as private, as it was, even five
years ago," he continued. "It is not
comfortable. It may be more
intellectual and more stimulating."
Stanford faces a test both of its
capacity to govern its own affairs and in
its ability to secure the financial support
it requires for its work, Pitzer added.
"In this most troublesome time of
criticism and distrust and anger, hope
and reason must be re-established . . ."
The Stanford Alumni Assembly
adopted a resolution "unmistakably"
commending "the manner in which
problems have been handled on
campus." The Assembly also praised
groups for their "firm dedication to the
fundamental purposes of the University
in its essential educational task of
providing future leaders for America."
