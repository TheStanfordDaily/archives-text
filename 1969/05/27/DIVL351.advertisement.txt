"Professor Joseph J Schwab has written a tough
minded, analytic, and prescriptive book that is
more humane and more generous than any
apologia of student protest now in print There

ing behind his diminishing grants, or junior fac
ulty member fearing both freedom and libera
tion, who can afford not to read it and to study
it Perhaps, in place of a few of the academic
hegiras planned for this coming summer, it
might be more profitable, and far less costly, if a
few beleaguered (and some of the as yet un
touched) institutions were to build student-fac
ulty seminars around the text Professor
Schwab has produced the definitive handbook
for creative academic revolution!'
