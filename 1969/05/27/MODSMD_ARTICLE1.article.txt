# Quiet Rally At Capitol
##

SACRAMENTO
(AP)—Thousands of students and
sympathizers staged a quiet march
and orderly rally at the State
Capitol Monday and cheered
loudest when Linus Pauling,
Nobel Peace Prize winner, spoke
of the "evil, immoral and tragic
episode in Berkeley." Pauling will
join the Stanford faculty next
year.
Thousands of students also
boycotted classes at University of
California campuses Monday in
protest to the use of police and
National Guardsmen in Berkeley.
Gov. Reagan, target of the
massed protest against National
Guard troops at Berkeley, did not
speak to the crowd. He met with a
few of its representatives in his
office.
Police and other estimates of
the size of the crowd ranged from
4,500 to nearly 10,000.
"The university is not the
property of Gov. Reagan and the
other regents ... we must protest
until police and National Guard
are removed from the campus of
the University of California,"
Pauling said on the Capitol steps.
Strike Effective
Pauling, also a Nobel Prize
winner in chemistry and a veteran
protestor against nuclear testing,
evoked the loudest demonstration
of the hot, sunny afternoon.
The march, organized by
students at UC Davis, began six
blocks from the Capitol.
"The strike seems to be
effective," said a campus
spokesman at Santa Cruz. There
are nearly 100,000 students on
nine university campuses.
"Belongs to Us"
Pauling said the university can
"serve us better if it is not
throttled by politicians .. . The
university belongs to us, the
students, faculty and the people."
He also said "the episode at
Berkeley' is part of a
pattern . . . the evil war in
Vietnam, the ABM antiballistic
missile, continued exploitation of
the poor by the rich" and the
draft.
"The military-industrial
complex is responsible for the evil
episode that took place at
Berkeley," Pauling said. "It is the
military-industrial complex that
supports Gov. Reagan."
Sparse Rally
Meanwhile in Berkeley,
partisans for "people's park"
Monday urged supporters to "get
into the streets" to show
University of California officials
they intend to win the battle over
the controversial UC-owned plot.
The words were shouted to a
sparsely attended noon rally on
the Berkeley campus, while
sympathizers on other campuses
around the state demonstrated
peacefully.

and orderly rally at the State
Capitol Monday and cheered
loudest when Linus Pauling,
Nobel Peace Prize winner, spoke
of the "evil, immoral and tragic
episode in Berkeley." Pauling will
join the Stanford faculty next
year.
Thousands of students also
boycotted classes at University of
California campuses Monday in
protest to the use of police and
National Guardsmen in Berkeley.
Gov. Reagan, target of the
massed protest against National
Guard troops at Berkeley, did not
speak to the crowd. He met with a
few of its representatives in his
office.
Police and other estimates of
the size of the crowd ranged from
4,500 to nearly 10,000.
"The university is not the
property of Gov. Reagan and the
other regents ... we must protest
until police and National Guard
are removed from the campus of
the University of California,"
Pauling said on the Capitol steps.
Strike Effective
Pauling, also a Nobel Prize
winner in chemistry and a veteran
protestor against nuclear testing,
evoked the loudest demonstration
of the hot, sunny afternoon.
The march, organized by
students at UC Davis, began six
blocks from the Capitol.
"The strike seems to be
effective," said a campus
spokesman at Santa Cruz. There
are nearly 100,000 students on
nine university campuses.
"Belongs to Us"
Pauling said the university can
"serve us better if it is not
throttled by politicians .. . The
university belongs to us, the
students, faculty and the people."
He also said "the episode at
Berkeley' is part of a
pattern . . . the evil war in
Vietnam, the ABM antiballistic
missile, continued exploitation of
the poor by the rich" and the
draft.
"The military-industrial
complex is responsible for the evil
episode that took place at
Berkeley," Pauling said. "It is the
military-industrial complex that
supports Gov. Reagan."
Sparse Rally
Meanwhile in Berkeley,
partisans for "people's park"
Monday urged supporters to "get
into the streets" to show
University of California officials
they intend to win the battle over
the controversial UC-owned plot.
The words were shouted to a
sparsely attended noon rally on
the Berkeley campus, while
sympathizers on other campuses
around the state demonstrated
peacefully.
