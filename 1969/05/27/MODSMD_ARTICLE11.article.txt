An army occupies the city ol Berkeley.
It is a city well policed by law enforcement
officers. There have been 900 arrests. The
jails are full of what one must call political
prisoners. The controversy began with
"People's Park."
The site of People's Park was obtained
by the University of California through its
power of condemnation. The original UC
report recommending acquisition claimed
that this low-cost housing area had "been
the scene of hippie concentration." Early
in the summer of 1968, the University
exercised its right of eminent domain, local
residents were evicted, and wreckers tore
down houses.
For nine months, the site was a muddy
wasteland. Then, on April 20, people began
to "homestead" the land. The site was
transformed into a park with support,
financial and otherwise, from local
merchants and members of the community.
Police took over the park site the
morning of May 15. Berkeley's students
and street people protested. Since then,
James Rector has died of shotgun wounds
inflicted by an Alameda county sheriff's
deputy. Another man, Alan Blanchard, is
now blind.
The chemical warfare being conducted
by helicopter against students in Berkeley
gives the Stanford community a concrete
example of the fruits of American war
research. Counterinsurgeney has come
home.
Yet, amid these occurrences Stanford
trustee John W. Gardner can solemnly
inform a newspaper interviewer, as he did
recently, that student militants are "fascists
of the left."
The same John Gardner, chairman of
the Urban Coalition, once said: "There

isn't one American in a hundred, perhaps a
thousand, who has a clear grasp ol the
unique partnership that is evolving between
public and private instrumentalities in this
country."
Student militants think they recognize a
similarity between this "partnership and
the political economy of a corporate state.
They find the existing social and
political order very like Henri de
Saint-Simon's managerialism or Edward
Bellamy's military capitalism. The ruling
coalition of big business, big government,
and big labor seems similar to the
institutional arrangement which Mussolini
envisaged as the future social organization
of Italy.
Recently, some political groups, notably
the United Republicans of California, have
recommended concentration camps lor
revolutionary malcontents. But in America
instead of moving the people to the
concentration camp, the concentration
camp is set up where the people are: police,
state troopers, and national guardsmen
patrol the streets of ghettoes and college
communities. People are in rebellion
against their local police state.
As the editorial in UC's Daily
Californian of May 20 said: "It it comes to
a question of naked power—and it has—the
best IUC Chancellor Roger Heyns] can
hope for is a draw. The . . . principle of
outright refusal to cooperate is being put
into action, and it's working. What we are
seeing in Berkeley today is the reason this
country will never be long controlled by
dictators. If someone is willing to die rather
than give up, he will not be torced to
abandon his position. Ultimately, his
position will be vindicated."

The chemical warfare being conducted
by helicopter against students in Berkeley
gives the Stanford community a concrete
example of the fruits of American war
research. Counterinsurgeney has come
home.
Yet, amid these occurrences Stanford
trustee John W. Gardner can solemnly
inform a newspaper interviewer, as he did
recently, that student militants are "fascists
of the left."
The same John Gardner, chairman of
the Urban Coalition, once said: "There

isn't one American in a hundred, perhaps a
thousand, who has a clear grasp ol the
unique partnership that is evolving between
public and private instrumentalities in this
country."
Student militants think they recognize a
similarity between this "partnership and
the political economy of a corporate state.
They find the existing social and
political order very like Henri de
Saint-Simon's managerialism or Edward
Bellamy's military capitalism. The ruling
coalition of big business, big government,
and big labor seems similar to the
institutional arrangement which Mussolini
envisaged as the future social organization
of Italy.
Recently, some political groups, notably
the United Republicans of California, have
recommended concentration camps lor
revolutionary malcontents. But in America
instead of moving the people to the
concentration camp, the concentration
camp is set up where the people are: police,
state troopers, and national guardsmen
patrol the streets of ghettoes and college
communities. People are in rebellion
against their local police state.
As the editorial in UC's Daily
Californian of May 20 said: "It it comes to
a question of naked power—and it has—the
best IUC Chancellor Roger Heyns] can
hope for is a draw. The . . . principle of
outright refusal to cooperate is being put
into action, and it's working. What we are
seeing in Berkeley today is the reason this
country will never be long controlled by
dictators. If someone is willing to die rather
than give up, he will not be torced to
abandon his position. Ultimately, his
position will be vindicated."
An army occupies the city ol Berkeley.
It is a city well policed by law enforcement
officers. There have been 900 arrests. The
jails are full of what one must call political
prisoners. The controversy began with
"People's Park."
The site of People's Park was obtained
by the University of California through its
power of condemnation. The original UC
report recommending acquisition claimed
that this low-cost housing area had "been
the scene of hippie concentration." Early
in the summer of 1968, the University
exercised its right of eminent domain, local
residents were evicted, and wreckers tore
down houses.
For nine months, the site was a muddy
wasteland. Then, on April 20, people began
to "homestead" the land. The site was
transformed into a park with support,
financial and otherwise, from local
merchants and members of the community.
Police took over the park site the
morning of May 15. Berkeley's students
and street people protested. Since then,
James Rector has died of shotgun wounds
inflicted by an Alameda county sheriff's
deputy. Another man, Alan Blanchard, is
now blind.
