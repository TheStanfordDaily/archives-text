## Prof. Demands Apology From Sapir 
### 
Editor, TIIE DAILY:
In the Daily of Friday May 23,
in a guest column, Marc Sapir
made an unfounded personal
attack oxi an individual Stanford
professor. I fear that this attack
will be silently shrugged off by
most members of the Stanford
community as merely a morally
reprehensible act. I must speak
out, since to me it raises certain
issues which are along those on
which the university as a place of
learning will either stand or fall.
I believe, and demand, that the
following are principles to which
all members of the Stanford
Community must adhere:
1) The Daily shall not permit
its columns to be used by a
student for accusations against a
specific faculty member arising
out of the student's dissatisfaction
with the faculty member's
evaluation of the student's course
work,
2) Students shall not interrupt
classes (lectures, seminars) to put
on "trial" a specific faculty
member, and when they do so
shall be seriously considered for
expulsion,
3) A course grade shall be
given a student by the faculty
member in charge of the course,
and shall only be based on the
student's academic performance
in the course. An individual
student desiring to challenge or
discuss his grade shall do so
through private review and appeal
procedures.
While Sapir's unfounded
personal attack on a Stanford
professor had as its long range aim
the undermining of the foregoing
principles, it had also a diabolical
short range aim. Sapir seeks to
undermine the work of the
Stanford Judicial Council by
singling out one of its members,
trying to make of him a
"controversial" figure, and
perhaps trying to create a basis for
disqualifying him as "prejudiced."
I respect the right of Sapir to
write about issues and criticize the
system. But I challenge his right
to personally attack an individual
faculty member on the basis of
their teacher-student relationship
in a course. When I see such an
attack, I do not have to ask "for
whom the bell tolls"; 1 know it
tolls for me.
I call upon all members of the
Stanford community (and
especially faculty members) to
demand that Marc Sapir, and
perhaps also the Editors of the
Stanford Daily, apologize for
attempting to create an
undeserved controversy (which is

inevitably personally unpleasant
and emotionally exhausting)
about a Stanford professor whose
humanity and scholarship has
earned the respect and affection
of all who know him.

• Another Word
Editor, THE DAILY:
I am pleased that Psychiatry
Professor Herb Leiderman of the
SJC feels so threatened by my
recent article that he has put into
print the lies contained in his
recommendation against me. The
Stanford community should note
that Leiderman's defensive
personal attack was put forward
instead of a justification of his
role on the SJC.
In his recommendation against
me the good professor stated that
he would have failed me in
Psychiatry if it were up to his
judgment alone —despite the fact
that he had praised my one and
only presentation to him. He also
stated in that recommendation,
and in the Daily, that I only
attended two of eight sessions he
led, although he knows full well
that I attended five.
Leiderman's behavior is
predictably given the
"professionalism" he is defending,
and given his role as a member of
the SJC. His arrogance in trying to
defend his unethical conduct, like
the arrogance of Homer Meaders,
SRI public relation croney, is
intended to obfuscate and ignore
the issues raised in Friday's Daily.
It is unfortunate that the SJC
won't take up Leiderman's
violation of the Fundamental
Standard in lying on a student's
recommendation as quickly as
they take radicals to task for
trying to stop Stanford's
involvement in South East Asia.
Marc Sapir
PS. Acting intelligently and
under a great deal of student
pressure, the Academic Senate of
the Med. School last Friday
afternoon, tentatively deleted the
phrase relating to "professional
relations with patients and
colleagues" from their new
suitability-for-graduation clause. I
hope this move signifies a new
awareness on the part of the

faculty concerning the potential
dangers of such a phrase.
• Retreat
Editor, THE DAILY:
The April Third Movement is
on retreat. In fact, it seems to be
breathing its last frantic gasp.
As Friday's Daily pointed out,
A3M's violence and
d is r up t i on — on and off
campus —has brought the
inevitable loss of much liberal
support and has clouded the
issues.
Broken windows, traffic-stopping
blockades, attacks on opponents,
and the many threats on the lives
of conservative activists
(conveniently ignored by Daily
staffers Sweeney and Wilson) are
hardly conducive to any decent
consideration of the vital and
pertinent issues which face
Stanford and the nation. These
developments have certainly not
contributed to the much maligned
rational dialogue.
The Movement is now a
mini-conglomerate of SDS,
Resistance, Maoists, and hard-core
diehards who have not yet given in
to the growing pressures of Exams
and paper deadlines. The
leadership, expectedly, remains
the same, even if somewhat tired
and frustrated by stiffening
resistance and growing legal
complications.
And now what?
The original 1600 supporters
of "a sit-in or some similar
action" were completely ignored
by the Board of Trustees. Where
are these "sincere, dedicated,
courageous" 1600 now that the
going has gotten rough?
SRI has been disrupted some.
More broken windows will not aid
the "continuing struggle" (as St.
Marx would put it); they will
surely bring some arrests and a
greater loss to Stanford.
The April Third Movement
should realize that its
whimsically-conceived
"liberations" are not only
unpopular but are also very
strongly opposed by most
Americans. The community will
simply not put up with senseless,
childish disruptions.
Campus radicals should
abandon their other-wo rid
Platonism which is doomed to
failure from the start.
If the A3M idealism is to be of
any lasting relevance, the
Movement should at least rid

itself of blatant hyprocisy,
fanatical threats of violence, its
intolerable self-righteousness, and
its profoundly nihilistic approach
to human problems.

• 1A Policy Board
Editor, THE DAILY:
The IA Policy Board published
on May 19, a statement that the
members of the IA allegedly
support the activities against SRI.
A poll among members
revealed that a majority does, in
fact, consider this statement
illegitimate and false.
We hope that any future
reference of the Policy Board of
the IA to the opinion of the
members of the International
Association will duly take notice
of the fact that knowledge of that
opinion is prerequisite to making
any statement regarding such
opinion.

Dilemma
Editor, THE DAILY:
It is very difficult to know
where to stand in relation to the
A3M's recent decision to use
disruptive tactics to achieve its
ends. I do not think the
theoretical exercise which leads to
the condemnation of all disruptive
tactics is particularly valid. It is
possible that the A3M acted
correctly.
Considering the widespread
support which the members of the

A3M received during the boycott,
I can well understand their refusal
to abide by the decision of the
Trustees. However, I hesitate to
condone their reaction due to the
negligible importance of the SRI
in the war industry. I am always
skeptical of the intelligence and
maturity of people who can
translate theoretical questions,
such as that of the morality of a
war, into tangible arguments to
support their attacks on a
relatively minor problem.
On the other hand, I think
something must be done to shake
this country out of its present
position. The demonstrations at
the SRI, regardless of their
validity, do help to do that.
Nevertheless, the type of coarse
and obscene rhetoric which one
often hears in the Plaza, the
one-sided exposes of the Trustees,
and the reliance of the Movement
on irrational arguments and mob
psychology to mobilize its
supporters makes me doubt that
its very existence is of value.
I believe in the old saying:
"Don't shoot until you see the
whites of their eyes." The
effectiveness of a movement, such
as the A3M on the nation or even
on the university is minimal and
transcient. People who join such a
group not only run the risk of
being suspended or arrested, but
also of convincing themself that it
is irrational or moral arguments
and demonstrations rather than
the work of professionals in
medicine, business, and so forth
which provide the true basis for
social progress. It is a pity that so
few people on this campus realize
that the present world is much
too complex for students, with or
without violence, to have much
affect on it.
