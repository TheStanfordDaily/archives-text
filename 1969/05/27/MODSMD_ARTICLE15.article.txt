## What's Happening At Hoover? 
### Peter Stern 
Much has been said in the past
month about the purpose,
financial backing, activities, and
personnel of the Hoover
Institution. On 30 April, a
member of the April 3rd
Movement distributed a tract
which stated that "Hoover's
anti-communism supports CBW,
counterinsurgency, and classified
(research) and Vietnam
war-related research by providing
the ideological justification for
them." At the 21 May A3M
meeting, it was suggested that "we
should go occupy and open and
liberate all the documents in the
Hoover." This speaker and two
others claimed that Governor
Reagan had announced that he
would send National Guard troops
if Hoover were occupied. Hoover
publications provide a red scare,
the speaker stated, and support
defense spending. He concluded
that Hoover was not covered by
the 16 May injunction.
Other charges made at this
meeting included the assertion
that the General Joseph Stilwell
(1883-1946) papers, at Hoover,
would "tell the people what the
Taiwan government is up to." A
faculty member of the A3M
stated that "the Stilwell papers, if
they were ever made public,
would tell the people a fantastic
story about the relationship
between American foreign policy
and China, and that is why those
papers are so heavily guarded and
why they are not available to any
researcher."
This speaker called Hoover "of
the world's main centers of
counterinsurgency research, that
in fact a hell of a lot more of it
goes on there than at all of
SRI . . ." "It was set up for the
sole purpose of counterinsur
gency," he continued. It has
"networks of agents operating all
over the world stealing documents
and engaging in counterinsur
gency," which is "paid for by the
lives of other people." Another
speaker stated that two members
of the Institution's permanent
staff "get into the actual practice
and the actual techniques" of
counterinsurgency.
Another A 3M member
elaborated the charges which had
appeared in the 30 April tract. He
asserted that Mr. Hoover's
fund-raising statement of 1959,
written when the former president
was eighty-five ("The purpose of
this Institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the

doctrines of Karl Marx . . ."), still
represented university policy. This
speaker considered the ideas of
senior staff members to constitute
sufficient motivation for
occupying Hoover. One staffer
was criticized for supporting
defense expenditures, testifying to
Congress on communist activities,
and being a racist; another had
written a textbook on
"democracy vs communism"
which was "out and out
brainwashing"; a third was a
conservative economist who
opposed Federal aid to education.
The coup de grace? "This year
they've got a guy from the CIA on
the staff named Devlin."
What is going on at Hoover?
Can the A3M justify an assault by
citing the reasons used for AEL
and the militant demonstrations
at SRI? Or do these charges stem
from a desire to attack ideas
distasteful to the liberal-radical
community? Has A3M been as
thorough in researching the
Hoover as it was on AEL and
SRI? Has it attempted to verify
whether or not President Hoover's
statement, quoted above, does
describe the activities and
publications of the Institution?
It should be made clear, first of
all, that the 16 May injunction
applies to Hoover; see p. 1 of the
Friday 15 (sic) May Daily. The
source for Governor Reagan's
statement about the Guard should
be made public, since no one,
including the persons who
brought it up last Wednesday, had
first-hand knowledge of such a
statement. And it is patently false
that John Devlin is on the Hoover
staff. The person who made this
statement, had ample opportunity
to check this out by talking with
Mr. Devlin on 15 May, at which
time he could have learned what
the title "research associate"
means. Mr. Devlin, on leave from
the National Board of Estimates
and the CIA, is researching a book
on the Arab Socialist Resurrection
party in Iraq. His status is the
same as that of any prominent
visiting scholar; he is not on the
Hoover payroll or staff.
Two charges have been made
repeatedly: one concerns the
Stilwell papers; the other relates
to counterinsurgency. It is
erroneous to assert that the
Stilwell papers are heavily guarded
and not available to researchers.
And it is highly questionable that
the Hoover either "provides the
ideological justification" for CBW
and counterinsurgency or is itself

a main center for counterinsur
gency research.
Stilwell
What are the Stilwell papers?
General Joseph Stilwell worked
closely with the Nationalist
Chinese during the war. T. H.
White edited a volume entitled
The Stilwell Papers (1948) based
upon these papers, which the
general's widow donated to the
Hoover in 1951, removing her
own restrictions from them in
1960. Stilwell's notebooks and 13
cartons of papers are available to
all scholars. Barbara Tuchman,
author of Guns of August, has
been using these papers for a
biography of the general.
Why has there been an uproar?
Approximately twenty envelopes
(less than 2% of the total
collection) are still classified by
the U.S. Army, which periodically
removes them from the first-floor
safe, declassifies some, which go
to the regular collection, and
returns the rest to the safe. No
one at Hoover has access to the
classified papers. So it is a tiny
proportion, . not the Stilwell
papers, that cannot be used by
researchers; and it is false to say
that the papers are heavily
guarded.
In all probability, classification
is maintained because of personal
comments therein about living
statesmen. The propriety of
maintaining any classified material
here is certainly subject to
scrutiny. Should the university be
a watchdog for U.S. Army
property? This is an excellent
subject for debate by the A3M.
But to assert that these few
envelopes of twenty-y ear-old
papers will "tell the people what
the Taiwan government is up to"
is asinine. To quote Chairman
Mao, "Only a blockhead cudgels
his brains on his own, or together
with a group, to 'find a solution'
or 'evolve an idea' without making
an investigation. It must be
stressed that this cannot possibly
lead to any effective solution or
any good idea."
Counterinsurgency
What about counterinsur
gency? The A3M "Guidelines,"
printed on the liberated AEL
press, state: "The Joint Chiefs of
Staff define counterinsurgency as
'those military, paramilitary,
political, economic, psychological
and civic actions taken by a
government to defeat the
subversive insurgency.'
Counterinsurgency research which
must be ceased includes military
operations and social science
techniques directed towards
suppressing insurgent or
nationalist revolutionary
movements, whether in Vietnam,
Thailand, Peru, or Oakland." (p.
6; my italics.) What activities of
the Hoover fall under this
definition? Does past membership
in the FBI constitute present
counterinsurgency? Testimony
before the HUAC? Support for
Barry Goldwater in 1964? Writing
an anti-communist textbook
(which was not published by
Hoover)? Opposition to Federal
aid to education? What activity is
being undertaken, what Hoover

publication can be cited, which
falls under the A3M definition of
counterinsurgency? These charges
are full of supressio veri and
suggestio falsi.
Who finances Hoover? It is true
that the Institution has refused to
make public its private donors.
This is regrettable, but is it
unusual? Do universities publish
the names of donors and the
amounts of their contributions?
Of Hoover's 1964-65 funds, 61%
came from private sources,
including the Scaife Foundation,
the Relm Foundation, and Eli
Lilly. The Relm Foundation also
sponsors graduate fellowships for
future teachers. In that year, 43%
of expenditures went for research
and publications, and 40% was
allocated to the library.
Who controls research and
publications? A committee
composed of collection curators
and staff members passes upon
manuscripts and projects. W.
Glenn Campbell has financial
control of this operation. If, as it
is charged, Hoover's publications
support an ideological position,
then one would expect to find
that all manuscripts prepared by
its conservative staff members
would be published. In fact, such
manuscripts are often rejected. All
works cited by title by Hoover's
critics on 30 April and 21 May
were published private, outside of
the Institution, by their authors.
Critics
Critics of Hoover would do
well to read the publications list,
and the publications themselves,
before associating the names of
conservative staff members with
ideological justification for
counterinsurgency. They should,
furthermore, ponder the question
of institutional responsibility for
material published outside
Hoover. When they can replace
distortion and innuendo with
investigation and facts, then they
can raise the level of their
criticism to the higher standards
established by the A3M with
regard to SRI, the Baxter
Committee, and AEL.
The Institution, on the other
hand, should act now to make
clear its purpose, the scope of its
publications, and the function of
its permanent staff members. It
should call attention to the
scholarly nature of the
bibliographies, histories, and
political studies it publishes, while
heeding the advice of a great
contemporary leader: "If we have
shortcomings, we are not afraid to
have them pointed out and
criticized, because we serve the
people. Anyone, no matter who,
may point out our
shortcomings ... If what he
proposes will benefit the people,
we will act upon it." The
Institution should continue to
work towards President Hoover's
hope that "From these records
there can be help to mankind in
its confusions and perplexities and
its yearnings for peace."

(1883-1946) papers, at Hoover,
would "tell the people what the
Taiwan government is up to." A
faculty member of the A3M
stated that "the Stilwell papers, if
they were ever made public,
would tell the people a fantastic
story about the relationship
between American foreign policy
and China, and that is why those
papers are so heavily guarded and
why they are not available to any
researcher."
This speaker called Hoover "of
the world's main centers of
counterinsurgency research, that
in fact a hell of a lot more of it
goes on there than at all of
SRI . . ." "It was set up for the
sole purpose of counterinsur
gency," he continued. It has
"networks of agents operating all
over the world stealing documents
and engaging in counterinsur
gency," which is "paid for by the
lives of other people." Another
speaker stated that two members
of the Institution's permanent
staff "get into the actual practice
and the actual techniques" of
counterinsurgency.
Another A 3M member
elaborated the charges which had
appeared in the 30 April tract. He
asserted that Mr. Hoover's
fund-raising statement of 1959,
written when the former president
was eighty-five ("The purpose of
this Institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the

doctrines of Karl Marx . . ."), still
represented university policy. This
speaker considered the ideas of
senior staff members to constitute
sufficient motivation for
occupying Hoover. One staffer
was criticized for supporting
defense expenditures, testifying to
Congress on communist activities,
and being a racist; another had
written a textbook on
"democracy vs communism"
which was "out and out
brainwashing"; a third was a
conservative economist who
opposed Federal aid to education.
The coup de grace? "This year
they've got a guy from the CIA on
the staff named Devlin."
What is going on at Hoover?
Can the A3M justify an assault by
citing the reasons used for AEL
and the militant demonstrations
at SRI? Or do these charges stem
from a desire to attack ideas
distasteful to the liberal-radical
community? Has A3M been as
thorough in researching the
Hoover as it was on AEL and
SRI? Has it attempted to verify
whether or not President Hoover's
statement, quoted above, does
describe the activities and
publications of the Institution?
It should be made clear, first of
all, that the 16 May injunction
applies to Hoover; see p. 1 of the
Friday 15 (sic) May Daily. The
source for Governor Reagan's
statement about the Guard should
be made public, since no one,
including the persons who
brought it up last Wednesday, had
first-hand knowledge of such a
statement. And it is patently false
that John Devlin is on the Hoover
staff. The person who made this
statement, had ample opportunity
to check this out by talking with
Mr. Devlin on 15 May, at which
time he could have learned what
the title "research associate"
means. Mr. Devlin, on leave from
the National Board of Estimates
and the CIA, is researching a book
on the Arab Socialist Resurrection
party in Iraq. His status is the
same as that of any prominent
visiting scholar; he is not on the
Hoover payroll or staff.
Two charges have been made
repeatedly: one concerns the
Stilwell papers; the other relates
to counterinsurgency. It is
erroneous to assert that the
Stilwell papers are heavily guarded
and not available to researchers.
And it is highly questionable that
the Hoover either "provides the
ideological justification" for CBW
and counterinsurgency or is itself

a main center for counterinsur
gency research.
Stilwell
What are the Stilwell papers?
General Joseph Stilwell worked
closely with the Nationalist
Chinese during the war. T. H.
White edited a volume entitled
The Stilwell Papers (1948) based
upon these papers, which the
general's widow donated to the
Hoover in 1951, removing her
own restrictions from them in
1960. Stilwell's notebooks and 13
cartons of papers are available to
all scholars. Barbara Tuchman,
author of Guns of August, has
been using these papers for a
biography of the general.
Why has there been an uproar?
Approximately twenty envelopes
(less than 2% of the total
collection) are still classified by
the U.S. Army, which periodically
removes them from the first-floor
safe, declassifies some, which go
to the regular collection, and
returns the rest to the safe. No
one at Hoover has access to the
classified papers. So it is a tiny
proportion, . not the Stilwell
papers, that cannot be used by
researchers; and it is false to say
that the papers are heavily
guarded.
In all probability, classification
is maintained because of personal
comments therein about living
statesmen. The propriety of
maintaining any classified material
here is certainly subject to
scrutiny. Should the university be
a watchdog for U.S. Army
property? This is an excellent
subject for debate by the A3M.
But to assert that these few
envelopes of twenty-y ear-old
papers will "tell the people what
the Taiwan government is up to"
is asinine. To quote Chairman
Mao, "Only a blockhead cudgels
his brains on his own, or together
with a group, to 'find a solution'
or 'evolve an idea' without making
an investigation. It must be
stressed that this cannot possibly
lead to any effective solution or
any good idea."
Counterinsurgency
What about counterinsur
gency? The A3M "Guidelines,"
printed on the liberated AEL
press, state: "The Joint Chiefs of
Staff define counterinsurgency as
'those military, paramilitary,
political, economic, psychological
and civic actions taken by a
government to defeat the
subversive insurgency.'
Counterinsurgency research which
must be ceased includes military
operations and social science
techniques directed towards
suppressing insurgent or
nationalist revolutionary
movements, whether in Vietnam,
Thailand, Peru, or Oakland." (p.
6; my italics.) What activities of
the Hoover fall under this
definition? Does past membership
in the FBI constitute present
counterinsurgency? Testimony
before the HUAC? Support for
Barry Goldwater in 1964? Writing
an anti-communist textbook
(which was not published by
Hoover)? Opposition to Federal
aid to education? What activity is
being undertaken, what Hoover

publication can be cited, which
falls under the A3M definition of
counterinsurgency? These charges
are full of supressio veri and
suggestio falsi.
Who finances Hoover? It is true
that the Institution has refused to
make public its private donors.
This is regrettable, but is it
unusual? Do universities publish
the names of donors and the
amounts of their contributions?
Of Hoover's 1964-65 funds, 61%
came from private sources,
including the Scaife Foundation,
the Relm Foundation, and Eli
Lilly. The Relm Foundation also
sponsors graduate fellowships for
future teachers. In that year, 43%
of expenditures went for research
and publications, and 40% was
allocated to the library.
Who controls research and
publications? A committee
composed of collection curators
and staff members passes upon
manuscripts and projects. W.
Glenn Campbell has financial
control of this operation. If, as it
is charged, Hoover's publications
support an ideological position,
then one would expect to find
that all manuscripts prepared by
its conservative staff members
would be published. In fact, such
manuscripts are often rejected. All
works cited by title by Hoover's
critics on 30 April and 21 May
were published private, outside of
the Institution, by their authors.
Critics
Critics of Hoover would do
well to read the publications list,
and the publications themselves,
before associating the names of
conservative staff members with
ideological justification for
counterinsurgency. They should,
furthermore, ponder the question
of institutional responsibility for
material published outside
Hoover. When they can replace
distortion and innuendo with
investigation and facts, then they
can raise the level of their
criticism to the higher standards
established by the A3M with
regard to SRI, the Baxter
Committee, and AEL.
The Institution, on the other
hand, should act now to make
clear its purpose, the scope of its
publications, and the function of
its permanent staff members. It
should call attention to the
scholarly nature of the
bibliographies, histories, and
political studies it publishes, while
heeding the advice of a great
contemporary leader: "If we have
shortcomings, we are not afraid to
have them pointed out and
criticized, because we serve the
people. Anyone, no matter who,
may point out our
shortcomings ... If what he
proposes will benefit the people,
we will act upon it." The
Institution should continue to
work towards President Hoover's
hope that "From these records
there can be help to mankind in
its confusions and perplexities and
its yearnings for peace."
(Peter S. Stern is an instructor
in the History Dept—Ed.)
Much has been said in the past
month about the purpose,
financial backing, activities, and
personnel of the Hoover
Institution. On 30 April, a
member of the April 3rd
Movement distributed a tract
which stated that "Hoover's
anti-communism supports CBW,
counterinsurgency, and classified
(research) and Vietnam
war-related research by providing
the ideological justification for
them." At the 21 May A3M
meeting, it was suggested that "we
should go occupy and open and
liberate all the documents in the
Hoover." This speaker and two
others claimed that Governor
Reagan had announced that he
would send National Guard troops
if Hoover were occupied. Hoover
publications provide a red scare,
the speaker stated, and support
defense spending. He concluded
that Hoover was not covered by
the 16 May injunction.
Other charges made at this
meeting included the assertion
that the General Joseph Stilwell
(1883-1946) papers, at Hoover,

and the actual techniques" of
counterinsurgency.
Another A 3M member
elaborated the charges which had
appeared in the 30 April tract. He
asserted that Mr. Hoover's
fund-raising statement of 1959,
written when the former president
was eighty-five ("The purpose of
this Institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the

doctrines of Karl Marx . . ."), still
represented university policy. This
speaker considered the ideas of
senior staff members to constitute
sufficient motivation for
occupying Hoover. One staffer
was criticized for supporting
defense expenditures, testifying to
Congress on communist activities,
and being a racist; another had
written a textbook on
"democracy vs communism"
which was "out and out
brainwashing"; a third was a
conservative economist who
opposed Federal aid to education.
The coup de grace? "This year
they've got a guy from the CIA on
the staff named Devlin."
What is going on at Hoover?
Can the A3M justify an assault by
citing the reasons used for AEL
and the militant demonstrations
at SRI? Or do these charges stem
from a desire to attack ideas
distasteful to the liberal-radical
community? Has A3M been as
thorough in researching the
Hoover as it was on AEL and
SRI? Has it attempted to verify
whether or not President Hoover's
statement, quoted above, does
describe the activities and
publications of the Institution?
It should be made clear, first of
all, that the 16 May injunction
applies to Hoover; see p. 1 of the
Friday 15 (sic) May Daily. The
source for Governor Reagan's
statement about the Guard should
be made public, since no one,
including the persons who
brought it up last Wednesday, had
first-hand knowledge of such a
statement. And it is patently false
that John Devlin is on the Hoover
staff. The person who made this
statement, had ample opportunity
to check this out by talking with
Mr. Devlin on 15 May, at which
time he could have learned what
the title "research associate"
means. Mr. Devlin, on leave from
the National Board of Estimates
and the CIA, is researching a book
on the Arab Socialist Resurrection
party in Iraq. His status is the
same as that of any prominent
visiting scholar; he is not on the
Hoover payroll or staff.
Two charges have been made
repeatedly: one concerns the
Stilwell papers; the other relates
to counterinsurgency. It is
erroneous to assert that the
Stilwell papers are heavily guarded
and not available to researchers.
And it is highly questionable that
the Hoover either "provides the
ideological justification" for CBW
and counterinsurgency or is itself

a main center for counterinsur
gency research.
Stilwell
What are the Stilwell papers?
General Joseph Stilwell worked
closely with the Nationalist
Chinese during the war. T. H.
White edited a volume entitled
The Stilwell Papers (1948) based
upon these papers, which the
general's widow donated to the
Hoover in 1951, removing her
own restrictions from them in
1960. Stilwell's notebooks and 13
cartons of papers are available to
all scholars. Barbara Tuchman,
author of Guns of August, has
been using these papers for a
biography of the general.
Why has there been an uproar?
Approximately twenty envelopes
(less than 2% of the total
collection) are still classified by
the U.S. Army, which periodically
removes them from the first-floor
safe, declassifies some, which go
to the regular collection, and
returns the rest to the safe. No
one at Hoover has access to the
classified papers. So it is a tiny
proportion, . not the Stilwell
papers, that cannot be used by
researchers; and it is false to say
that the papers are heavily
guarded.
In all probability, classification
is maintained because of personal
comments therein about living
statesmen. The propriety of
maintaining any classified material
here is certainly subject to
scrutiny. Should the university be
a watchdog for U.S. Army
property? This is an excellent
subject for debate by the A3M.
But to assert that these few
envelopes of twenty-y ear-old
papers will "tell the people what
the Taiwan government is up to"
is asinine. To quote Chairman
Mao, "Only a blockhead cudgels
his brains on his own, or together
with a group, to 'find a solution'
or 'evolve an idea' without making
an investigation. It must be
stressed that this cannot possibly
lead to any effective solution or
any good idea."
Counterinsurgency
What about counterinsur
gency? The A3M "Guidelines,"
printed on the liberated AEL
press, state: "The Joint Chiefs of
Staff define counterinsurgency as
'those military, paramilitary,
political, economic, psychological
and civic actions taken by a
government to defeat the
subversive insurgency.'
Counterinsurgency research which
must be ceased includes military
operations and social science
techniques directed towards
suppressing insurgent or
nationalist revolutionary
movements, whether in Vietnam,
Thailand, Peru, or Oakland." (p.
6; my italics.) What activities of
the Hoover fall under this
definition? Does past membership
in the FBI constitute present
counterinsurgency? Testimony
before the HUAC? Support for
Barry Goldwater in 1964? Writing
an anti-communist textbook
(which was not published by
Hoover)? Opposition to Federal
aid to education? What activity is
being undertaken, what Hoover

publication can be cited, which
falls under the A3M definition of
counterinsurgency? These charges
are full of supressio veri and
suggestio falsi.
Who finances Hoover? It is true
that the Institution has refused to
make public its private donors.
This is regrettable, but is it
unusual? Do universities publish
the names of donors and the
amounts of their contributions?
Of Hoover's 1964-65 funds, 61%
came from private sources,
including the Scaife Foundation,
the Relm Foundation, and Eli
Lilly. The Relm Foundation also
sponsors graduate fellowships for
future teachers. In that year, 43%
of expenditures went for research
and publications, and 40% was
allocated to the library.
Who controls research and
publications? A committee
composed of collection curators
and staff members passes upon
manuscripts and projects. W.
Glenn Campbell has financial
control of this operation. If, as it
is charged, Hoover's publications
support an ideological position,
then one would expect to find
that all manuscripts prepared by
its conservative staff members
would be published. In fact, such
manuscripts are often rejected. All
works cited by title by Hoover's
critics on 30 April and 21 May
were published private, outside of
the Institution, by their authors.
Critics
Critics of Hoover would do
well to read the publications list,
and the publications themselves,
before associating the names of
conservative staff members with
ideological justification for
counterinsurgency. They should,
furthermore, ponder the question
of institutional responsibility for
material published outside
Hoover. When they can replace
distortion and innuendo with
investigation and facts, then they
can raise the level of their
criticism to the higher standards
established by the A3M with
regard to SRI, the Baxter
Committee, and AEL.
The Institution, on the other
hand, should act now to make
clear its purpose, the scope of its
publications, and the function of
its permanent staff members. It
should call attention to the
scholarly nature of the
bibliographies, histories, and
political studies it publishes, while
heeding the advice of a great
contemporary leader: "If we have
shortcomings, we are not afraid to
have them pointed out and
criticized, because we serve the
people. Anyone, no matter who,
may point out our
shortcomings ... If what he
proposes will benefit the people,
we will act upon it." The
Institution should continue to
work towards President Hoover's
hope that "From these records
there can be help to mankind in
its confusions and perplexities and
its yearnings for peace."
(Peter S. Stern is an instructor
in the History Dept—Ed.)
Much has been said in the past
month about the purpose,
financial backing, activities, and
personnel of the Hoover
Institution. On 30 April, a
member of the April 3rd
Movement distributed a tract
which stated that "Hoover's
anti-communism supports CBW,
counterinsurgency, and classified
(research) and Vietnam
war-related research by providing
the ideological justification for
them." At the 21 May A3M
meeting, it was suggested that "we
should go occupy and open and
liberate all the documents in the
Hoover." This speaker and two
others claimed that Governor
Reagan had announced that he
would send National Guard troops
if Hoover were occupied. Hoover
publications provide a red scare,
the speaker stated, and support
defense spending. He concluded
that Hoover was not covered by
the 16 May injunction.
Other charges made at this
meeting included the assertion
that the General Joseph Stilwell
(1883-1946) papers, at Hoover,
would "tell the people what the
Taiwan government is up to." A
faculty member of the A3M
stated that "the Stilwell papers, if
they were ever made public,
would tell the people a fantastic
story about the relationship
between American foreign policy
and China, and that is why those
papers are so heavily guarded and
why they are not available to any
researcher."
This speaker called Hoover "of
the world's main centers of
counterinsurgency research, that
in fact a hell of a lot more of it
goes on there than at all of
SRI . . ." "It was set up for the
sole purpose of counterinsur
gency," he continued. It has
"networks of agents operating all
over the world stealing documents
and engaging in counterinsur
gency," which is "paid for by the
lives of other people." Another
speaker stated that two members
of the Institution's permanent
staff "get into the actual practice
and the actual techniques" of
counterinsurgency.
Another A 3M member

What is going on at Hoover?
Can the A3M justify an assault by
citing the reasons used for AEL
and the militant demonstrations
at SRI? Or do these charges stem
from a desire to attack ideas
distasteful to the liberal-radical
community? Has A3M been as
thorough in researching the
Hoover as it was on AEL and
SRI? Has it attempted to verify
whether or not President Hoover's
statement, quoted above, does
describe the activities and
publications of the Institution?
It should be made clear, first of
all, that the 16 May injunction
applies to Hoover; see p. 1 of the
Friday 15 (sic) May Daily. The
source for Governor Reagan's
statement about the Guard should
be made public, since no one,
including the persons who
brought it up last Wednesday, had
first-hand knowledge of such a
statement. And it is patently false
that John Devlin is on the Hoover
staff. The person who made this
statement, had ample opportunity
to check this out by talking with
Mr. Devlin on 15 May, at which
time he could have learned what
the title "research associate"
means. Mr. Devlin, on leave from
the National Board of Estimates
and the CIA, is researching a book
on the Arab Socialist Resurrection
party in Iraq. His status is the
same as that of any prominent
visiting scholar; he is not on the
Hoover payroll or staff.
Two charges have been made
repeatedly: one concerns the
Stilwell papers; the other relates
to counterinsurgency. It is
erroneous to assert that the
Stilwell papers are heavily guarded
and not available to researchers.
And it is highly questionable that
the Hoover either "provides the
ideological justification" for CBW
and counterinsurgency or is itself

a main center for counterinsur
gency research.
Stilwell
What are the Stilwell papers?
General Joseph Stilwell worked
closely with the Nationalist
Chinese during the war. T. H.
White edited a volume entitled
The Stilwell Papers (1948) based
upon these papers, which the
general's widow donated to the
Hoover in 1951, removing her
own restrictions from them in
1960. Stilwell's notebooks and 13
cartons of papers are available to
all scholars. Barbara Tuchman,
author of Guns of August, has
been using these papers for a
biography of the general.
Why has there been an uproar?
Approximately twenty envelopes
(less than 2% of the total
collection) are still classified by
the U.S. Army, which periodically
removes them from the first-floor
safe, declassifies some, which go
to the regular collection, and
returns the rest to the safe. No
one at Hoover has access to the
classified papers. So it is a tiny
proportion, . not the Stilwell
papers, that cannot be used by
researchers; and it is false to say
that the papers are heavily
guarded.
In all probability, classification
is maintained because of personal
comments therein about living
statesmen. The propriety of
maintaining any classified material
here is certainly subject to
scrutiny. Should the university be
a watchdog for U.S. Army
property? This is an excellent
subject for debate by the A3M.
But to assert that these few
envelopes of twenty-y ear-old
papers will "tell the people what
the Taiwan government is up to"
is asinine. To quote Chairman
Mao, "Only a blockhead cudgels
his brains on his own, or together
with a group, to 'find a solution'
or 'evolve an idea' without making
an investigation. It must be
stressed that this cannot possibly
lead to any effective solution or
any good idea."
Counterinsurgency
What about counterinsur
gency? The A3M "Guidelines,"
printed on the liberated AEL
press, state: "The Joint Chiefs of
Staff define counterinsurgency as
'those military, paramilitary,
political, economic, psychological
and civic actions taken by a
government to defeat the
subversive insurgency.'
Counterinsurgency research which
must be ceased includes military
operations and social science
techniques directed towards
suppressing insurgent or
nationalist revolutionary
movements, whether in Vietnam,
Thailand, Peru, or Oakland." (p.
6; my italics.) What activities of
the Hoover fall under this
definition? Does past membership
in the FBI constitute present
counterinsurgency? Testimony
before the HUAC? Support for
Barry Goldwater in 1964? Writing
an anti-communist textbook
(which was not published by
Hoover)? Opposition to Federal
aid to education? What activity is
being undertaken, what Hoover

publication can be cited, which
falls under the A3M definition of
counterinsurgency? These charges
are full of supressio veri and
suggestio falsi.
Who finances Hoover? It is true
that the Institution has refused to
make public its private donors.
This is regrettable, but is it
unusual? Do universities publish
the names of donors and the
amounts of their contributions?
Of Hoover's 1964-65 funds, 61%
came from private sources,
including the Scaife Foundation,
the Relm Foundation, and Eli
Lilly. The Relm Foundation also
sponsors graduate fellowships for
future teachers. In that year, 43%
of expenditures went for research
and publications, and 40% was
allocated to the library.
Who controls research and
publications? A committee
composed of collection curators
and staff members passes upon
manuscripts and projects. W.
Glenn Campbell has financial
control of this operation. If, as it
is charged, Hoover's publications
support an ideological position,
then one would expect to find
that all manuscripts prepared by
its conservative staff members
would be published. In fact, such
manuscripts are often rejected. All
works cited by title by Hoover's
critics on 30 April and 21 May
were published private, outside of
the Institution, by their authors.
Critics
Critics of Hoover would do
well to read the publications list,
and the publications themselves,
before associating the names of
conservative staff members with
ideological justification for
counterinsurgency. They should,
furthermore, ponder the question
of institutional responsibility for
material published outside
Hoover. When they can replace
distortion and innuendo with
investigation and facts, then they
can raise the level of their
criticism to the higher standards
established by the A3M with
regard to SRI, the Baxter
Committee, and AEL.
The Institution, on the other
hand, should act now to make
clear its purpose, the scope of its
publications, and the function of
its permanent staff members. It
should call attention to the
scholarly nature of the
bibliographies, histories, and
political studies it publishes, while
heeding the advice of a great
contemporary leader: "If we have
shortcomings, we are not afraid to
have them pointed out and
criticized, because we serve the
people. Anyone, no matter who,
may point out our
shortcomings ... If what he
proposes will benefit the people,
we will act upon it." The
Institution should continue to
work towards President Hoover's
hope that "From these records
there can be help to mankind in
its confusions and perplexities and
its yearnings for peace."
(Peter S. Stern is an instructor
in the History Dept—Ed.)
Much has been said in the past
month about the purpose,
financial backing, activities, and
personnel of the Hoover
Institution. On 30 April, a
member of the April 3rd
Movement distributed a tract
which stated that "Hoover's
anti-communism supports CBW,
counterinsurgency, and classified
(research) and Vietnam
war-related research by providing
the ideological justification for
them." At the 21 May A3M
meeting, it was suggested that "we
should go occupy and open and
liberate all the documents in the
Hoover." This speaker and two
others claimed that Governor
Reagan had announced that he
would send National Guard troops
if Hoover were occupied. Hoover
publications provide a red scare,
the speaker stated, and support
defense spending. He concluded
that Hoover was not covered by
the 16 May injunction.
Other charges made at this
meeting included the assertion
that the General Joseph Stilwell
(1883-1946) papers, at Hoover,
would "tell the people what the
Taiwan government is up to." A
faculty member of the A3M
stated that "the Stilwell papers, if
they were ever made public,
would tell the people a fantastic
story about the relationship
between American foreign policy
and China, and that is why those
papers are so heavily guarded and
why they are not available to any
researcher."
This speaker called Hoover "of
the world's main centers of
counterinsurgency research, that
in fact a hell of a lot more of it
goes on there than at all of
SRI . . ." "It was set up for the
sole purpose of counterinsur
gency," he continued. It has
"networks of agents operating all
over the world stealing documents
and engaging in counterinsur
gency," which is "paid for by the
lives of other people." Another
speaker stated that two members
of the Institution's permanent
staff "get into the actual practice
and the actual techniques" of
counterinsurgency.
Another A 3M member
elaborated the charges which had
appeared in the 30 April tract. He
asserted that Mr. Hoover's
fund-raising statement of 1959,
written when the former president
was eighty-five ("The purpose of
this Institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the

doctrines of Karl Marx . . ."), still
represented university policy. This
speaker considered the ideas of
senior staff members to constitute
sufficient motivation for
occupying Hoover. One staffer
was criticized for supporting
defense expenditures, testifying to
Congress on communist activities,
and being a racist; another had
written a textbook on
"democracy vs communism"
which was "out and out
brainwashing"; a third was a
conservative economist who
opposed Federal aid to education.
The coup de grace? "This year
they've got a guy from the CIA on
the staff named Devlin."

statement, had ample opportunity
to check this out by talking with
Mr. Devlin on 15 May, at which
time he could have learned what
the title "research associate"
means. Mr. Devlin, on leave from
the National Board of Estimates
and the CIA, is researching a book
on the Arab Socialist Resurrection
party in Iraq. His status is the
same as that of any prominent
visiting scholar; he is not on the
Hoover payroll or staff.
Two charges have been made
repeatedly: one concerns the
Stilwell papers; the other relates
to counterinsurgency. It is
erroneous to assert that the
Stilwell papers are heavily guarded
and not available to researchers.
And it is highly questionable that
the Hoover either "provides the
ideological justification" for CBW
and counterinsurgency or is itself

a main center for counterinsur
gency research.
Stilwell
What are the Stilwell papers?
General Joseph Stilwell worked
closely with the Nationalist
Chinese during the war. T. H.
White edited a volume entitled
The Stilwell Papers (1948) based
upon these papers, which the
general's widow donated to the
Hoover in 1951, removing her
own restrictions from them in
1960. Stilwell's notebooks and 13
cartons of papers are available to
all scholars. Barbara Tuchman,
author of Guns of August, has
been using these papers for a
biography of the general.
Why has there been an uproar?
Approximately twenty envelopes
(less than 2% of the total
collection) are still classified by
the U.S. Army, which periodically
removes them from the first-floor
safe, declassifies some, which go
to the regular collection, and
returns the rest to the safe. No
one at Hoover has access to the
classified papers. So it is a tiny
proportion, . not the Stilwell
papers, that cannot be used by
researchers; and it is false to say
that the papers are heavily
guarded.
In all probability, classification
is maintained because of personal
comments therein about living
statesmen. The propriety of
maintaining any classified material
here is certainly subject to
scrutiny. Should the university be
a watchdog for U.S. Army
property? This is an excellent
subject for debate by the A3M.
But to assert that these few
envelopes of twenty-y ear-old
papers will "tell the people what
the Taiwan government is up to"
is asinine. To quote Chairman
Mao, "Only a blockhead cudgels
his brains on his own, or together
with a group, to 'find a solution'
or 'evolve an idea' without making
an investigation. It must be
stressed that this cannot possibly
lead to any effective solution or
any good idea."
Counterinsurgency
What about counterinsur
gency? The A3M "Guidelines,"
printed on the liberated AEL
press, state: "The Joint Chiefs of
Staff define counterinsurgency as
'those military, paramilitary,
political, economic, psychological
and civic actions taken by a
government to defeat the
subversive insurgency.'
Counterinsurgency research which
must be ceased includes military
operations and social science
techniques directed towards
suppressing insurgent or
nationalist revolutionary
movements, whether in Vietnam,
Thailand, Peru, or Oakland." (p.
6; my italics.) What activities of
the Hoover fall under this
definition? Does past membership
in the FBI constitute present
counterinsurgency? Testimony
before the HUAC? Support for
Barry Goldwater in 1964? Writing
an anti-communist textbook
(which was not published by
Hoover)? Opposition to Federal
aid to education? What activity is
being undertaken, what Hoover

publication can be cited, which
falls under the A3M definition of
counterinsurgency? These charges
are full of supressio veri and
suggestio falsi.
Who finances Hoover? It is true
that the Institution has refused to
make public its private donors.
This is regrettable, but is it
unusual? Do universities publish
the names of donors and the
amounts of their contributions?
Of Hoover's 1964-65 funds, 61%
came from private sources,
including the Scaife Foundation,
the Relm Foundation, and Eli
Lilly. The Relm Foundation also
sponsors graduate fellowships for
future teachers. In that year, 43%
of expenditures went for research
and publications, and 40% was
allocated to the library.
Who controls research and
publications? A committee
composed of collection curators
and staff members passes upon
manuscripts and projects. W.
Glenn Campbell has financial
control of this operation. If, as it
is charged, Hoover's publications
support an ideological position,
then one would expect to find
that all manuscripts prepared by
its conservative staff members
would be published. In fact, such
manuscripts are often rejected. All
works cited by title by Hoover's
critics on 30 April and 21 May
were published private, outside of
the Institution, by their authors.
Critics
Critics of Hoover would do
well to read the publications list,
and the publications themselves,
before associating the names of
conservative staff members with
ideological justification for
counterinsurgency. They should,
furthermore, ponder the question
of institutional responsibility for
material published outside
Hoover. When they can replace
distortion and innuendo with
investigation and facts, then they
can raise the level of their
criticism to the higher standards
established by the A3M with
regard to SRI, the Baxter
Committee, and AEL.
The Institution, on the other
hand, should act now to make
clear its purpose, the scope of its
publications, and the function of
its permanent staff members. It
should call attention to the
scholarly nature of the
bibliographies, histories, and
political studies it publishes, while
heeding the advice of a great
contemporary leader: "If we have
shortcomings, we are not afraid to
have them pointed out and
criticized, because we serve the
people. Anyone, no matter who,
may point out our
shortcomings ... If what he
proposes will benefit the people,
we will act upon it." The
Institution should continue to
work towards President Hoover's
hope that "From these records
there can be help to mankind in
its confusions and perplexities and
its yearnings for peace."
(Peter S. Stern is an instructor
in the History Dept—Ed.)
Much has been said in the past
month about the purpose,
financial backing, activities, and
personnel of the Hoover
Institution. On 30 April, a
member of the April 3rd
Movement distributed a tract
which stated that "Hoover's
anti-communism supports CBW,
counterinsurgency, and classified
(research) and Vietnam
war-related research by providing
the ideological justification for
them." At the 21 May A3M
meeting, it was suggested that "we
should go occupy and open and
liberate all the documents in the
Hoover." This speaker and two
others claimed that Governor
Reagan had announced that he
would send National Guard troops
if Hoover were occupied. Hoover
publications provide a red scare,
the speaker stated, and support
defense spending. He concluded
that Hoover was not covered by
the 16 May injunction.
Other charges made at this
meeting included the assertion
that the General Joseph Stilwell
(1883-1946) papers, at Hoover,
would "tell the people what the
Taiwan government is up to." A
faculty member of the A3M
stated that "the Stilwell papers, if
they were ever made public,
would tell the people a fantastic
story about the relationship
between American foreign policy
and China, and that is why those
papers are so heavily guarded and
why they are not available to any
researcher."
This speaker called Hoover "of
the world's main centers of
counterinsurgency research, that
in fact a hell of a lot more of it
goes on there than at all of
SRI . . ." "It was set up for the
sole purpose of counterinsur
gency," he continued. It has
"networks of agents operating all
over the world stealing documents
and engaging in counterinsur
gency," which is "paid for by the
lives of other people." Another
speaker stated that two members
of the Institution's permanent
staff "get into the actual practice
and the actual techniques" of
counterinsurgency.
Another A 3M member
elaborated the charges which had
appeared in the 30 April tract. He
asserted that Mr. Hoover's
fund-raising statement of 1959,
written when the former president
was eighty-five ("The purpose of
this Institution must be, by its
research and publications, to
demonstrate the evils of the

doctrines of Karl Marx . . ."), still
represented university policy. This
speaker considered the ideas of
senior staff members to constitute
sufficient motivation for
occupying Hoover. One staffer
was criticized for supporting
defense expenditures, testifying to
Congress on communist activities,
and being a racist; another had
written a textbook on
"democracy vs communism"
which was "out and out
brainwashing"; a third was a
conservative economist who
opposed Federal aid to education.
The coup de grace? "This year
they've got a guy from the CIA on
the staff named Devlin."
What is going on at Hoover?
Can the A3M justify an assault by
citing the reasons used for AEL
and the militant demonstrations
at SRI? Or do these charges stem
from a desire to attack ideas
distasteful to the liberal-radical
community? Has A3M been as
thorough in researching the
Hoover as it was on AEL and
SRI? Has it attempted to verify
whether or not President Hoover's
statement, quoted above, does
describe the activities and
publications of the Institution?
It should be made clear, first of
all, that the 16 May injunction
applies to Hoover; see p. 1 of the
Friday 15 (sic) May Daily. The
source for Governor Reagan's
statement about the Guard should
be made public, since no one,
including the persons who
brought it up last Wednesday, had
first-hand knowledge of such a
statement. And it is patently false
that John Devlin is on the Hoover
staff. The person who made this
statement, had ample opportunity
to check this out by talking with
Mr. Devlin on 15 May, at which
time he could have learned what
the title "research associate"
means. Mr. Devlin, on leave from
the National Board of Estimates
and the CIA, is researching a book
on the Arab Socialist Resurrection
party in Iraq. His status is the
