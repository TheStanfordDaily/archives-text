## Peace Corpsâ€”CIA 
### Maurice Rahe 
At the tender age of eight, the
Peace Corps has been violently
raped. She will probably die from
the after-effects. According to
Drew Pearson's Washington
Merry-Go-Round of May 23 "The
late President Kennedy's orders to
keep the Peace Corps free of any
CIA taint have been quietly
abandoned. The Peace Corps
head, dynamic, 34 year old Joe
Blatchford, came to the Nixon
Administration from Accion, a
volunteer organization that has
accepted money from at least two
CIA fronts. He continues, stating
that "Accion has done some
outstanding volunteer work in
Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina.
However it has received indirect
CIA financing through the Donner
Foundation and the Free Labor
Committee."
For those members of both
Accion and the Peace Corps who
abhor the multfarious schemes of
the CIA, this comes as a serious
blow. Above and beyond the
personal sense of repugnance that
comes from being associated with
CIA, most volunteers realize that
such connections are inherently
damaging to the goals of any
volunteer organization that relies
on gaining the confidence of
foreign nationals. Every returned
volunteer knows from personal
experience the tremendously
difficult task of convincing host
country nationals that he is not a
spy. The problem has its
humorous aspects when the seedy
little "inventor" wants to sell his
submarine plans to the volunteers.
It has its heartbreaking aspects
when a friend of two years
confesses that although he trusts
you, what about that girl with the
funny looking box in her room? Is
it really a radio transmitter? In
whatever form it takes, the
problem of differentiation of the
volunteer from CIA is
omnipresent and extremely

difficult. With Blatchford
identified with the CIA in a
column that has worldwide
distribution, the task clearly
becomes impossible.
Individual
No less important to the
organization than foreign
confidence is the confidence of
the individual volunteer. How
many of the people who
volunteered their services would
again do so in the light of the
comment of Terry Holcombe,
who replaced Blatchford as
Accion's Executive Director?
After confirming a $50,000 grant
from the Donner Foundation,
headed by Franklin Johnson, a
former CIA official, Holcombe
stated, "We would accept another
donation." Is this limited to
money, or are a few extra
"volunteers" accepted as well?
Until this type of mentality is
removed from Accion and Peace
Corps, no one will be sure.
Either through fumbling
ineptitude or malicious intent
Nixon has come close to
destroying the Peace Corps. So
long as Blatchford is heading the
organization, no progress can be
made toward the goals for which
it was founded. Political action
must be taken by the thousands
of volunteers, returned volunteers,
and potential applicants who have
devoted their time and energy to
the Pecae Corps ideal. Blatchford
and any other CIA sympathizers
must resign immediately.
Returned volunteers, potential
applicants, and others who oppose
CIA in the Peace Corps must join
together on Wednesday, May 28,
at the International Center or
organize. Meeting at noon. Bring
your lunch and sack Blatchford.

many of the people who
volunteered their services would
again do so in the light of the
comment of Terry Holcombe,
who replaced Blatchford as
Accion's Executive Director?
After confirming a $50,000 grant
from the Donner Foundation,
headed by Franklin Johnson, a
former CIA official, Holcombe
stated, "We would accept another
donation." Is this limited to
money, or are a few extra
"volunteers" accepted as well?
Until this type of mentality is
removed from Accion and Peace
Corps, no one will be sure.
Either through fumbling
ineptitude or malicious intent
Nixon has come close to
destroying the Peace Corps. So
long as Blatchford is heading the
organization, no progress can be
made toward the goals for which
it was founded. Political action
must be taken by the thousands
of volunteers, returned volunteers,
and potential applicants who have
devoted their time and energy to
the Pecae Corps ideal. Blatchford
and any other CIA sympathizers
must resign immediately.
Returned volunteers, potential
applicants, and others who oppose
CIA in the Peace Corps must join
together on Wednesday, May 28,
at the International Center or
organize. Meeting at noon. Bring
your lunch and sack Blatchford.

At the tender age of eight, the
Peace Corps has been violently
raped. She will probably die from
the after-effects. According to
Drew Pearson's Washington
Merry-Go-Round of May 23 "The
late President Kennedy's orders to
keep the Peace Corps free of any
CIA taint have been quietly
abandoned. The Peace Corps
head, dynamic, 34 year old Joe
Blatchford, came to the Nixon
Administration from Accion, a
volunteer organization that has
accepted money from at least two
CIA fronts. He continues, stating
that "Accion has done some
outstanding volunteer work in
Venezuela, Brazil, and Argentina.
However it has received indirect
CIA financing through the Donner
Foundation and the Free Labor
Committee."
For those members of both
Accion and the Peace Corps who
abhor the multfarious schemes of
the CIA, this comes as a serious
blow. Above and beyond the
personal sense of repugnance that
comes from being associated with
CIA, most volunteers realize that
such connections are inherently
damaging to the goals of any
volunteer organization that relies
on gaining the confidence of
foreign nationals. Every returned
volunteer knows from personal
experience the tremendously
difficult task of convincing host
country nationals that he is not a
spy. The problem has its
humorous aspects when the seedy
little "inventor" wants to sell his
submarine plans to the volunteers.
It has its heartbreaking aspects
when a friend of two years
confesses that although he trusts
you, what about that girl with the
funny looking box in her room? Is
it really a radio transmitter? In
whatever form it takes, the
problem of differentiation of the
volunteer from CIA is
omnipresent and extremely

difficult. With Blatchford
identified with the CIA in a
column that has worldwide
distribution, the task clearly
becomes impossible.
Individual
No less important to the
organization than foreign
confidence is the confidence of
the individual volunteer. How
