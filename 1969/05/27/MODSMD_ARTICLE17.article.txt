# Biological Warfare At Stanford
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The possibility of chemical-biological warfare research at Stanford
University itself has been dismissed as inconceivable by many faculty
during this spring's controversies. The faculty Senate considered, but
rejected, an explicit ban on such work.
But not so long ago, Stanford operated an Aerosol Lab under
chemistry professor Philip Leighton (now retired), which did projects
for the Army Chemical Corps, an agency whose mission is CBW.
Reproduced below is an abstract of two reports coming out of the
Aerosol Lab in 1961, with explicit mention of "biological warfare
agents." Next to it is an interview with one of the researchers, William
A. Perkins, in which he denies that the work involved biological
warfare.

Reproduced above are abstracts of two secret reports send to the
Army Chemical Corps. Notice the underlined "descriptors." According
to TAB, these descriptors refer to the "scientific and technical content"
of the report. The descriptors with asterisks (*) are the most important
ones and are used for indexing.

Perkins Interview
(William A. Perkins, who is co-author of the
two reports described in the adjacent TAB
excerpt, received his Ph.D. from Stanford and
worked here as a research associate in the
chemistry department until moving to private
industry in the 1960'5. He is now with Metronics
Associates, a firm in the Stanford Industrial Park
which works on "environmental" problems,
according to Perkins.
Dr. Perkins was called on the telephone Sunday
by The Daily. We read him the descriptions of the
reports he worked on. The following conversation
ensued.)
Daily: Are the contracts involved with offensive
biological warfare?
Perkins: No. It doesn't involve biological
warfare at aU. I don't know where you ever got
that. We were concerned with problems about
atmospheric diffusion from the standpoint of air
pollution, and whoever received the information
decided that they could use it for that (biological
warfare) too.
Daily: Who sponsored the contract?
Perkins: It was sponsored by the Defense
Department.
Daily: What agency?
Perkins: Well, gosh, I'd have to look back and
check on that. DOD sponsors a whole lot of
activities for fundamental knowledge which is
expensive work, and it is about the only agency
which can sponsor that work.
Daily: You don't remember which agency did
sponsor this work?
Perkins: 1 don't remember whether it was the
Atomic Energy Commission, or the Air Force, or
the Chemical Corps. There are a number -of
different groups who sponsored work along this
line. They are all concerned with the problems of
atmospheric pollutants. (It was the Chemical
Corps-Ed.)
Daily: If the project is concerned with
atmospheric pollutants, why was it a "secret"
report?
Perkins: Well, it was classified after it was
published. And we have no control over
that... I'm sure all the classification has been
removed.
Daily: When you were working on it, there was
no knowledge or suspicion that this contract was
being sponsored by the Army for Biological
warfare?

Perkins: It wasn't biological warfare at all.
Daily: Can you give me a better idea of what it
did involve?
Perkins: Well, one of the problems with air
pollution is how far from the source the pollutant
is going to be carried. About the only way you can
tell is to actually measure pollutants at
sources. .. The connotation of biological warfare
raises all kinds of ugly implications. 1 don't even
know how to begin doing biological warfare stuff.
(Then Perkins referred us to a researcher in the
Physical Sciences division at SRI who could give us
more information on CBW.)
4 Air Pollution'?
Perkin's denial didn't satisfy us, so we sought
further information. In the Army Research Task
Summary, vol. 4, 1961, p. 535, there is a report on
contract DA-4d36-07-002: "Meterological Aspects
of CBR Warfare." The principal investigators are
Perkins and Leighton, and the "laboratories and
installations" for the contract are "Leland
Stanford Jr. University" and "U.S. Army Proving
Ground, Dugway, Utah," the center forCBW field
testing.
The purpose of this contract is listed as "to
improve the knowledge of the effects of
meterological conditions on the behavior of
aerosols and particulates."
Experiments were planned on "tropical rain
forest canopy penetration," such as in Southeast
Asia.
Airborne BW
Some excerpts from Seymour Hersh's Chemical
and Biological Warfare (Bobb-Merrill, New York,
1968, $7.50):
"There are two general methods for delivering
biological agents: 'The first, and most important
of these, is through overt military delivery through
weapons systems designed to create an aerosol or
cloud of the agent .. (p. 85)
"The annual meeting of an international group
of scientists devoted to world peace added this
critique of biological warfare: 'The necessary
conditions for a successful attack ... would be
subject to the errors of meterological
forecasting ..." (p. 82).
