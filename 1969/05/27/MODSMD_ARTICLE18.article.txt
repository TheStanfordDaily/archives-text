# Whiting Play "The Devils" Called Exciting But Uneven
## 
### ROBERT P. WALTER 
An audience full of actors fills
Toyon Lounge with the strains of
Gregorian chant and transforms it
into seventeenth century France
as The Company launches its
second major production of the
year, The Devils by John Whiting.
The play is a historical pageant
about man's destruction of
himself and his fellow men in the
name of Justice and his quest for
God. It concerns a worldly priest,
Urbain Grandier, who is trapped
and destroyed by the political
machinery of a debauched church
and state for allegedly having
communion with the devil and
thereby bringing various evils
upon the good sisters of St.
Ursula's Convent His chief
accuser is Sister Jeanne of the
Angels—the tiny, hunchbacked
Prioress of the Convent.
The Devils is an extremely
difficult scipt to perform. An
over-written adaptation of an
Aldous Huxley book, it is filled
with short and fragmented scenes,
long and melodramatic speeches,
and laboured and circuitous
language. The quickly shifting
focus of the short scenes require a
tremendous forward thrust to tie
them together. Each individual
actor must sustain his individual
sense of madness, his unique
dedication to the particular cause
he espouses through long speeches
and a longer evening. Without this
consistency the play degenerates
into a series of interesting but
unrelated vignettes of
sensationalism. Above all, the
script demands a sophistication of
style and technique in the acting
of each role in order to divert it
from its natural tendency toward
melodrama.
Professionals Failed
The casts of the original New
York and London productions
failed to find these things and the
script destroyed them. The
Company, a talented group of
Stanford undergraduates, works
hard to breath a spark of
theatrical life into this jumble of
text but cannot sustain a fire.
Unlike the professional
productions of this show, the
problem is not in the ensemble
work or in the drive and
dedication with which the cast
attacks the text. The Company is
probably one of the finest
theatrical ensembles in the area.
Their production of Marat/Sade
last Fall as well as the second act
mad scene attest to their brilliance
in this area. The problem in this
production is that it depends on
strong individual performances
and not on ensemble work. Most
of the actors have difficulty
meeting the demands of the text
when removed from the ensemble
and asked to sustain individual
roles.

There are a few cameo
performances that are stunning
exceptions to this generalization.
Pat Cassidy is delightfully brilliant
as Louis Trincant, the Public
Prosecutor whose daughter is
tutored and seduced by Grandier.
Matt Schneiderman is extremely
convincing as Prince Henri de
Conde, an effite faggot who
discourses at length on the
repugnancy of women. Pat Dillon
is properly crotchety as the aged
Bishop of Poitiers, De la
Rochepozay.
Mannoury the surgeon and
Adam the chemist, a Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern combination
who assist in Grandier's downfall,
are often amusing especially when
the actors (William Ganz and
Stephen Cramolini) are unaware
of their own humor. As De
Laubardement, the Kings special
commissioner and the visible
villian of the play, Rich Storm has
some fine moments when he
resists a tendency to overact.
Lead Underplayed
In the lead role of Father
Urbain Grandier, Mark Griffiths is
forced to say that "there are two
things a man should never be
asked to do in front of other men:
perform with a woman and suffer
pain." Yet the playwright forces
the actor to do both on stage, and
whereas Mr. Griffiths makes
beautiful love, he does not seem
to realize that a scream alone does
not show pain. In attempting to
portray a truly human man, Mr.
Griffiths underplays the role
ostensibly to allow himself the
peaks of emotion which the script
demands. Unfortunately, with the
exception of his first act prayer
and his story of death in the
second act, he never ascends those
same peaks. He seems to forget
that a man does not live merely
because he talks.
As Sister Jeanne of the Angels,
the tortured and tormented
accusser of Father Grandier,
Nancy Papale takes a strong stab
at a role which demands a
maturity far beyond her own. The
script forces the actress to make
instantaneous transformations
from childlike innocence to
demoniac passion. Too often Miss
Papale seems to substitute her
intellect for her groin. Her
orgiastic visions require a total
abandonment to the role which
she seems unwilling to make. It is
relatively easy to play at madness
on the stage but it is extremely
difficult to honestly portray the
same.
Andrea Hine, as Grandier's
young love, Phillipe Trincant, has
a similar difficulty abandoning
herself to the anguish and insanity
of lust and desire. She seems to
deny the devil inside herself, and
as a result, her moments of

passion as well as her innocence
often seemed forced.
Effort Commended
The Company is to be
commended for undertaking a
project as complex and difficult as
a production of The Devils. Their
show has moments which are
disturbingly real and
tremendously exciting. The drive,
dedication and enthusiasm which
they project are reasons enough to
see this play but they cannot
overcome what the group lacks in
individual technique, consistency
and maturity.
The Devils will have its final
performance tonight at 8:00 p.m.
in Toyon Lounge. Admission is
free.

not show pain. In attempting to
portray a truly human man, Mr.
Griffiths underplays the role
ostensibly to allow himself the
peaks of emotion which the script
demands. Unfortunately, with the
exception of his first act prayer
and his story of death in the
second act, he never ascends those
same peaks. He seems to forget
that a man does not live merely
because he talks.
As Sister Jeanne of the Angels,
the tortured and tormented
accusser of Father Grandier,
Nancy Papale takes a strong stab
at a role which demands a
maturity far beyond her own. The
script forces the actress to make
instantaneous transformations
from childlike innocence to
demoniac passion. Too often Miss
Papale seems to substitute her
intellect for her groin. Her
orgiastic visions require a total
abandonment to the role which
she seems unwilling to make. It is
relatively easy to play at madness
on the stage but it is extremely
difficult to honestly portray the
same.
Andrea Hine, as Grandier's
young love, Phillipe Trincant, has
a similar difficulty abandoning
herself to the anguish and insanity
of lust and desire. She seems to
deny the devil inside herself, and
as a result, her moments of

passion as well as her innocence
often seemed forced.
Effort Commended
The Company is to be
commended for undertaking a
project as complex and difficult as
a production of The Devils. Their
show has moments which are
disturbingly real and
tremendously exciting. The drive,
dedication and enthusiasm which
they project are reasons enough to
see this play but they cannot
overcome what the group lacks in
individual technique, consistency
and maturity.
The Devils will have its final
performance tonight at 8:00 p.m.
in Toyon Lounge. Admission is
free.

FREER THAN MOST — Two unregistered residents put themselves above
things - temporarily.
An audience full of actors fills
Toyon Lounge with the strains of
Gregorian chant and transforms it
into seventeenth century France
as The Company launches its
second major production of the
year, The Devils by John Whiting.
The play is a historical pageant
about man's destruction of
himself and his fellow men in the
name of Justice and his quest for
God. It concerns a worldly priest,
Urbain Grandier, who is trapped
and destroyed by the political
machinery of a debauched church
and state for allegedly having
communion with the devil and
thereby bringing various evils
upon the good sisters of St.
Ursula's Convent His chief
accuser is Sister Jeanne of the
Angels—the tiny, hunchbacked
Prioress of the Convent.
The Devils is an extremely
difficult scipt to perform. An
over-written adaptation of an
Aldous Huxley book, it is filled
with short and fragmented scenes,
long and melodramatic speeches,
and laboured and circuitous
language. The quickly shifting
focus of the short scenes require a
tremendous forward thrust to tie
them together. Each individual
actor must sustain his individual
sense of madness, his unique
dedication to the particular cause
he espouses through long speeches
and a longer evening. Without this
consistency the play degenerates
into a series of interesting but
unrelated vignettes of
sensationalism. Above all, the
script demands a sophistication of
style and technique in the acting
of each role in order to divert it
from its natural tendency toward
melodrama.
Professionals Failed
The casts of the original New
York and London productions
failed to find these things and the
script destroyed them. The
Company, a talented group of
Stanford undergraduates, works
hard to breath a spark of
theatrical life into this jumble of
text but cannot sustain a fire.
Unlike the professional
productions of this show, the
problem is not in the ensemble
work or in the drive and
dedication with which the cast
attacks the text. The Company is
probably one of the finest
theatrical ensembles in the area.
Their production of Marat/Sade
last Fall as well as the second act
mad scene attest to their brilliance
in this area. The problem in this
production is that it depends on
strong individual performances
and not on ensemble work. Most
of the actors have difficulty
meeting the demands of the text
when removed from the ensemble
and asked to sustain individual
roles.

There are a few cameo
performances that are stunning
exceptions to this generalization.
Pat Cassidy is delightfully brilliant
as Louis Trincant, the Public
Prosecutor whose daughter is
tutored and seduced by Grandier.
Matt Schneiderman is extremely
convincing as Prince Henri de
Conde, an effite faggot who
discourses at length on the
repugnancy of women. Pat Dillon
is properly crotchety as the aged
Bishop of Poitiers, De la
Rochepozay.
Mannoury the surgeon and
Adam the chemist, a Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern combination
who assist in Grandier's downfall,
are often amusing especially when
the actors (William Ganz and
Stephen Cramolini) are unaware
of their own humor. As De
Laubardement, the Kings special
commissioner and the visible
villian of the play, Rich Storm has
some fine moments when he
resists a tendency to overact.
Lead Underplayed
In the lead role of Father
Urbain Grandier, Mark Griffiths is
forced to say that "there are two
things a man should never be
asked to do in front of other men:
perform with a woman and suffer
pain." Yet the playwright forces
the actor to do both on stage, and
whereas Mr. Griffiths makes
beautiful love, he does not seem
to realize that a scream alone does
not show pain. In attempting to
portray a truly human man, Mr.
Griffiths underplays the role
ostensibly to allow himself the
peaks of emotion which the script
demands. Unfortunately, with the

theatrical life into this jumble of
text but cannot sustain a fire.
Unlike the professional
productions of this show, the
problem is not in the ensemble
work or in the drive and
dedication with which the cast
attacks the text. The Company is
probably one of the finest
theatrical ensembles in the area.
Their production of Marat/Sade
last Fall as well as the second act
mad scene attest to their brilliance
in this area. The problem in this
production is that it depends on
strong individual performances
and not on ensemble work. Most
of the actors have difficulty
meeting the demands of the text
when removed from the ensemble
and asked to sustain individual
roles.

There are a few cameo
performances that are stunning
exceptions to this generalization.
Pat Cassidy is delightfully brilliant
as Louis Trincant, the Public
Prosecutor whose daughter is
tutored and seduced by Grandier.
Matt Schneiderman is extremely
convincing as Prince Henri de
Conde, an effite faggot who
discourses at length on the
repugnancy of women. Pat Dillon
is properly crotchety as the aged
Bishop of Poitiers, De la
Rochepozay.
Mannoury the surgeon and
Adam the chemist, a Rosencrantz
and Guildenstern combination
who assist in Grandier's downfall,
are often amusing especially when
the actors (William Ganz and
Stephen Cramolini) are unaware
of their own humor. As De
Laubardement, the Kings special
commissioner and the visible
villian of the play, Rich Storm has
some fine moments when he
resists a tendency to overact.
Lead Underplayed
In the lead role of Father
Urbain Grandier, Mark Griffiths is
forced to say that "there are two
things a man should never be
asked to do in front of other men:
perform with a woman and suffer
pain." Yet the playwright forces
the actor to do both on stage, and
whereas Mr. Griffiths makes
beautiful love, he does not seem
to realize that a scream alone does
not show pain. In attempting to
portray a truly human man, Mr.
Griffiths underplays the role
ostensibly to allow himself the
peaks of emotion which the script
demands. Unfortunately, with the
exception of his first act prayer
and his story of death in the
second act, he never ascends those
same peaks. He seems to forget
that a man does not live merely
because he talks.
As Sister Jeanne of the Angels,
the tortured and tormented
accusser of Father Grandier,
Nancy Papale takes a strong stab
at a role which demands a
maturity far beyond her own. The
script forces the actress to make
instantaneous transformations
from childlike innocence to
demoniac passion. Too often Miss
Papale seems to substitute her
intellect for her groin. Her
orgiastic visions require a total
abandonment to the role which
she seems unwilling to make. It is
relatively easy to play at madness
on the stage but it is extremely
difficult to honestly portray the
same.
Andrea Hine, as Grandier's
young love, Phillipe Trincant, has
a similar difficulty abandoning
herself to the anguish and insanity
of lust and desire. She seems to
deny the devil inside herself, and
as a result, her moments of

passion as well as her innocence
often seemed forced.
Effort Commended
The Company is to be
commended for undertaking a
project as complex and difficult as
a production of The Devils. Their
show has moments which are
disturbingly real and
tremendously exciting. The drive,
dedication and enthusiasm which
they project are reasons enough to
see this play but they cannot
overcome what the group lacks in
individual technique, consistency
and maturity.
The Devils will have its final
performance tonight at 8:00 p.m.
in Toyon Lounge. Admission is
free.

FREER THAN MOST — Two unregistered residents put themselves above
things - temporarily.
An audience full of actors fills
Toyon Lounge with the strains of
Gregorian chant and transforms it
into seventeenth century France
as The Company launches its
second major production of the
year, The Devils by John Whiting.
The play is a historical pageant
about man's destruction of
himself and his fellow men in the
name of Justice and his quest for
God. It concerns a worldly priest,
Urbain Grandier, who is trapped
and destroyed by the political
machinery of a debauched church
and state for allegedly having
communion with the devil and
thereby bringing various evils
upon the good sisters of St.
Ursula's Convent His chief
accuser is Sister Jeanne of the
Angels—the tiny, hunchbacked
Prioress of the Convent.
The Devils is an extremely
difficult scipt to perform. An
over-written adaptation of an
Aldous Huxley book, it is filled
with short and fragmented scenes,
long and melodramatic speeches,
and laboured and circuitous
language. The quickly shifting
focus of the short scenes require a
tremendous forward thrust to tie
them together. Each individual
actor must sustain his individual
sense of madness, his unique
dedication to the particular cause
he espouses through long speeches
and a longer evening. Without this
consistency the play degenerates
into a series of interesting but
unrelated vignettes of
sensationalism. Above all, the
script demands a sophistication of
style and technique in the acting
of each role in order to divert it
from its natural tendency toward
melodrama.
Professionals Failed
The casts of the original New
York and London productions
failed to find these things and the
script destroyed them. The
Company, a talented group of
Stanford undergraduates, works
