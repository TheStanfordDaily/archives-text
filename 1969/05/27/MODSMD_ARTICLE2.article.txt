# A3M To March On Hoover
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Following a noon rally in White
Plaza, the April 3rd Movement will stage
a march on Hoover Institute today to
confront director Glenn Campbell "on
his actions as a UC regent and on
Hoover Institute's counterinsurgency
activities."
The action comes in the wake of
warrants issued late yesterday for the
arrest of seven members of the
movement. The charges stem from
offenses alleged to have occurred during
the May 16 demonstration at SRl's
Hanover facility.
Those named include: Leonard
Siegel, for wearing a mask, riot, failure
to disperse, and malicious mischief; Jim
Shoch, malicious mischief; David Pugh,
assault and battery; Jim Snyder, assault
and battery; Jeff Klein, arson; Art
Busse, malicious mischief; and Bill
McCarthy assault and battery.
All charges except the one for arson
are misdemeanors. According to
members of the movement, more
warrants are anticipated. Names of
those who signed affidavits for the
warrants were not known as of last
night.
In a related action yesterday, seven
of the fifteen arrested May 16 were
given a continuance in Municipal Court
until June 10 to answer charges for
"failure to disperse."
Today's rally and march are part of
A3M's participation in a statewide "day
of solidarity" with Berkeley as well as a
continuation of the efforts to halt
counterinsurgency work at SRI.

According to a leaflet distributed
around campus yesterday, the
movement will ask Campbell "to
explain how the work that the Hoover
Institute does relates to the situation at
Berkeley."
Among those scheduled to speak at
the noon rally include representatives
from the Berkeley People's Park
Committee and Mike Sweeney, who will
give a detailed report on SRl's
involvement in Berkeley.
Last night the movement sent a letter
to Campbell saying that "on behalf of
our brothers and sisters in Berkeley and
in the interest of many concerned
people in the Stanford community we
ask you to appear on the steps of
Hoover Tower at 1:15 on Tuesday May
27 to answer questions about your
actions as a regent of the University of
California in regard to the recent events
there; we ask you or one of the Senior
Staff to discuss the Hoover Institute and
its policies."
Contacted at his home last night
Campbell said that he "received no
letter."
Asked about what might happen
tomorrow he stated that I will "wait
and see what happens. I will be in my
office tomorrow." Campbell's office is
located on the fourteenth floor of
Hoover Tower.
Campbell said flatly that the Hoover
Institute was "not involved in
counterinsurgency work," and asked
members of the movement to please
define the term instead of just throwing
it around."

Questioned about the situation at
Berkeley, Campbell said that "the
Governor was requested by President
Hitch of the University and the
Chancellor to declare a state of
emergency. He since has brought in
forces necessary to restore peace and
tranquility.
"I certainly don't think it was an
appropriate action for the rally to be
held in Sproul Hall and for several
thousand people to riot.
"I regret the death of Mr. Rector but
you have to keep in focus these
situations.
"I also regret deeply the death of the
custodian at the University of Santa
Barbara, and I hope you will include
that."

Berkeley."
Among those scheduled to speak at
the noon rally include representatives
from the Berkeley People's Park
Committee and Mike Sweeney, who will
give a detailed report on SRl's
involvement in Berkeley.
Last night the movement sent a letter
to Campbell saying that "on behalf of
our brothers and sisters in Berkeley and
in the interest of many concerned
people in the Stanford community we
ask you to appear on the steps of
Hoover Tower at 1:15 on Tuesday May
27 to answer questions about your
actions as a regent of the University of
California in regard to the recent events
there; we ask you or one of the Senior
Staff to discuss the Hoover Institute and
its policies."
Contacted at his home last night
Campbell said that he "received no
letter."
Asked about what might happen
tomorrow he stated that I will "wait
and see what happens. I will be in my
office tomorrow." Campbell's office is
located on the fourteenth floor of
Hoover Tower.
Campbell said flatly that the Hoover
Institute was "not involved in
counterinsurgency work," and asked
members of the movement to please
define the term instead of just throwing
it around."

Questioned about the situation at
Berkeley, Campbell said that "the
Governor was requested by President
Hitch of the University and the
Chancellor to declare a state of
emergency. He since has brought in
forces necessary to restore peace and
tranquility.
"I certainly don't think it was an
appropriate action for the rally to be
held in Sproul Hall and for several
thousand people to riot.
"I regret the death of Mr. Rector but
you have to keep in focus these
situations.
"I also regret deeply the death of the
custodian at the University of Santa
Barbara, and I hope you will include
that."


SOUL MASTER—Ray Charles brings his entire show to Roscoe Maples Pavilion tonight, in a
benefit performance for the Stanford Children's Convalescent Hospital. Charles says "Soul is
when you take a Song and make it part of you—a part that's so true, so real, people think it
must have happened to you. It's like electricity . . . like a spirit, a drive, a power. People can
touch people, can't they." Tickets available at Tresidder and the door. Showtime is 7:30 p.m.
Following a noon rally in White
Plaza, the April 3rd Movement will stage
a march on Hoover Institute today to
confront director Glenn Campbell "on
his actions as a UC regent and on
Hoover Institute's counterinsurgency
activities."
The action comes in the wake of
warrants issued late yesterday for the
arrest of seven members of the
movement. The charges stem from
offenses alleged to have occurred during
the May 16 demonstration at SRl's
Hanover facility.
Those named include: Leonard
Siegel, for wearing a mask, riot, failure
to disperse, and malicious mischief; Jim
Shoch, malicious mischief; David Pugh,
assault and battery; Jim Snyder, assault
and battery; Jeff Klein, arson; Art
Busse, malicious mischief; and Bill
McCarthy assault and battery.
All charges except the one for arson
are misdemeanors. According to
members of the movement, more
warrants are anticipated. Names of
those who signed affidavits for the
warrants were not known as of last
night.
In a related action yesterday, seven
of the fifteen arrested May 16 were
given a continuance in Municipal Court
until June 10 to answer charges for
"failure to disperse."
Today's rally and march are part of
A3M's participation in a statewide "day
of solidarity" with Berkeley as well as a
continuation of the efforts to halt
counterinsurgency work at SRI.

According to a leaflet distributed
around campus yesterday, the
movement will ask Campbell "to
