# Small, Extensive Program
## Nurses Meet Patient Needs 
### VIRGINIA DERBY 
Relatively few students are
aware that Stanford offers an
undergraduate program in nursing.
The School of Nursing is small,
with a high faculty-student ratio.
Its size (approximately 60
students) helps account for the
fact that many students do not
know of its existence.
The Stanford nursing program
is five years in length, but nursing
is studied only in the third,
fourth, and fifth years. As a

preparation to professional
education, the entering student
must have completed two years of
college work, including Stanford
General Studies requirements, and
specified courses in the natural
sciences.
The student in the last three
years, in addition to taking
nursing courses, may elect to
enroll in courses offered in other
schools and departments of the
university.
Few Exposed
Since few people are exposed
to the nursing profession in any
depth, it is understandable that
many view nursing as a
bedpan-emptying, pill-pushing
occupation, and nursing education
as vocational training; therefore,
they are surprised to see nursing
included in the degree offerings of
a university.
An excerpt from the
phil osophy of the Stanford
University School of Nursing may
begin to alter some prevalent
attitudes:
The faculty of the School of
Nursing believes that the nursing
program should provide for the
development of knowledge,
understanding, and skills essential
for the practice of professional
nursing. The professional and
general courses are planned to
help the student develop values,
increase the ability to think
critically in making sound
judgments, and understand
principles of scientific

investigation. The faculty believes
that the role of the nurse should
involve participation as a
colleague with members of the
health team in the maintenance of
health, prevention of illness, care
of the sick, and promotion of
rehabilitation.
Nursing students at Stanford
are not only taught the technical
, knowledge necessary for the safe
and effective practice of nursing,
but also learn to develop in
themselves the ability to aid in
meeting the sick person's personal
and emotional needs, as well as his
medical needs.
Co-ordination Needed
The professional nurse sees the
need to coordinate the various
medical services so that together
they give the patient the best care
possible and do not work at cross
purposes. The nurse must also be
sensitive to nonverbal clues to
changes in the patient's medical
and psychological status.
Nursing courses include both
classroom and clinical situations.
In the clinical area the student
gives patient care, applying the
techniques and principles learned
in class. As settings for their
clinical experience, Stanford
nursing students utilize not only
Stanford University Hospital, but
also many other facilities,
including Stanford Bing Nursery
School, Stanford Children's
Convalescent Hospital, the Santa
Clara County Health Department,
Veteran's Administration Hospital
in Palo Alto, and the Naval
Hospital in Oakland.
Expanded Role
The expanding role of the
nurse, together with an increased
need for nurses, offers the nursing
student many challenging
professional positions following
graduation. The university
educated nurse may choose to
work as a staff nurse in a hospital
or in a clinical specialty area, such
as psychiatric or intensive care
nursing. The nurse may also go on

to study for a Master's or a
Doctorate.
As people come to realize that
everyone deserves health care and
not just those who can afford it,
nurses are participating with
others in the health professions,
through various government and
private health care facilities, to
deliver health care and health
education to all the people.
During the summers students
have a chance to pursue their
career interests. Many work in
hospitals, and this summer, one
student, interested in nursing on
an international level, will be
going to Tanzania to participate in
a work project; another will be
working with Mexican-Americans
in ao OEO-sponsored health
project in King City.
Future
In order to determine the
future role of nursing education at
Stanford, a comprehensive Study
of Nursing Education is now
underway. The whole faculty of
the Nursing School and interested
and committed students have now
become involved in this study.
Some of the issues to be
considered are: the rationale for
the present baccalaureate program
at Stanford and the possibility of
establishing a graduate program in
nursing; the relation of nursing
education to medical education,
to other health science programs,
to nursing administration, and to
the community; and
determination of the admissions
and recruitment policies for the
School, and the special need to
recruit minority students.
Like the SES, the Study of
Nursing Education at Stanford,
will be an in-depth study, lasting a
year or more, with enthusiastic
faculty and students determined
to develop to the fullest Stanford
Nursing School's particular
position as part of the medical
school and medical center and to
offer a truly outstanding program
to meet the nursing needs of the
future.

Hospital in Oakland.
Expanded Role
The expanding role of the
nurse, together with an increased
need for nurses, offers the nursing
student many challenging
professional positions following
graduation. The university
educated nurse may choose to
work as a staff nurse in a hospital
or in a clinical specialty area, such
as psychiatric or intensive care
nursing. The nurse may also go on

to study for a Master's or a
Doctorate.
As people come to realize that
everyone deserves health care and
not just those who can afford it,
nurses are participating with
others in the health professions,
through various government and
private health care facilities, to
deliver health care and health
education to all the people.
During the summers students
have a chance to pursue their
career interests. Many work in
hospitals, and this summer, one
student, interested in nursing on
an international level, will be
going to Tanzania to participate in
a work project; another will be
working with Mexican-Americans
in ao OEO-sponsored health
project in King City.
Future
In order to determine the
future role of nursing education at
Stanford, a comprehensive Study
of Nursing Education is now
underway. The whole faculty of
the Nursing School and interested
and committed students have now
become involved in this study.
Some of the issues to be
considered are: the rationale for
the present baccalaureate program
at Stanford and the possibility of
establishing a graduate program in
nursing; the relation of nursing
education to medical education,
to other health science programs,
to nursing administration, and to
the community; and
determination of the admissions
and recruitment policies for the
School, and the special need to
recruit minority students.
Like the SES, the Study of
Nursing Education at Stanford,
will be an in-depth study, lasting a
year or more, with enthusiastic
faculty and students determined
to develop to the fullest Stanford
Nursing School's particular
position as part of the medical
school and medical center and to
offer a truly outstanding program
to meet the nursing needs of the
future.
Relatively few students are
aware that Stanford offers an
undergraduate program in nursing.
The School of Nursing is small,
with a high faculty-student ratio.
Its size (approximately 60
students) helps account for the
fact that many students do not
know of its existence.
The Stanford nursing program
is five years in length, but nursing
is studied only in the third,
fourth, and fifth years. As a

preparation to professional
education, the entering student
must have completed two years of
college work, including Stanford
General Studies requirements, and
specified courses in the natural
sciences.
The student in the last three
years, in addition to taking
nursing courses, may elect to
enroll in courses offered in other
schools and departments of the
university.
Few Exposed
Since few people are exposed
to the nursing profession in any
depth, it is understandable that
many view nursing as a
bedpan-emptying, pill-pushing
occupation, and nursing education
as vocational training; therefore,
they are surprised to see nursing
included in the degree offerings of
a university.
An excerpt from the
phil osophy of the Stanford
University School of Nursing may
begin to alter some prevalent
attitudes:
The faculty of the School of
Nursing believes that the nursing
program should provide for the
development of knowledge,
understanding, and skills essential
for the practice of professional
nursing. The professional and
general courses are planned to
help the student develop values,
increase the ability to think
critically in making sound
judgments, and understand
principles of scientific

investigation. The faculty believes
that the role of the nurse should
involve participation as a
colleague with members of the
health team in the maintenance of
health, prevention of illness, care
of the sick, and promotion of
rehabilitation.
Nursing students at Stanford
are not only taught the technical
, knowledge necessary for the safe
and effective practice of nursing,
but also learn to develop in
themselves the ability to aid in
meeting the sick person's personal
and emotional needs, as well as his
medical needs.
Co-ordination Needed
The professional nurse sees the
need to coordinate the various
medical services so that together
they give the patient the best care
possible and do not work at cross
purposes. The nurse must also be
sensitive to nonverbal clues to
changes in the patient's medical
and psychological status.
Nursing courses include both
classroom and clinical situations.
In the clinical area the student
gives patient care, applying the
techniques and principles learned
in class. As settings for their
clinical experience, Stanford
nursing students utilize not only
Stanford University Hospital, but
also many other facilities,
including Stanford Bing Nursery
School, Stanford Children's
Convalescent Hospital, the Santa
Clara County Health Department,
Veteran's Administration Hospital
in Palo Alto, and the Naval
Hospital in Oakland.

to the nursing profession in any
depth, it is understandable that
many view nursing as a
bedpan-emptying, pill-pushing
occupation, and nursing education
as vocational training; therefore,
they are surprised to see nursing
included in the degree offerings of
a university.
An excerpt from the
phil osophy of the Stanford
University School of Nursing may
begin to alter some prevalent
attitudes:
The faculty of the School of
Nursing believes that the nursing
program should provide for the
development of knowledge,
understanding, and skills essential
for the practice of professional
nursing. The professional and
general courses are planned to
help the student develop values,
increase the ability to think
critically in making sound
judgments, and understand
principles of scientific

investigation. The faculty believes
that the role of the nurse should
involve participation as a
colleague with members of the
health team in the maintenance of
health, prevention of illness, care
of the sick, and promotion of
rehabilitation.
Nursing students at Stanford
are not only taught the technical
, knowledge necessary for the safe
and effective practice of nursing,
but also learn to develop in
themselves the ability to aid in
meeting the sick person's personal
and emotional needs, as well as his
medical needs.
Co-ordination Needed
The professional nurse sees the
need to coordinate the various
medical services so that together
they give the patient the best care
possible and do not work at cross
purposes. The nurse must also be
sensitive to nonverbal clues to
changes in the patient's medical
and psychological status.
Nursing courses include both
classroom and clinical situations.
In the clinical area the student
gives patient care, applying the
techniques and principles learned
in class. As settings for their
clinical experience, Stanford
nursing students utilize not only
Stanford University Hospital, but
also many other facilities,
including Stanford Bing Nursery
School, Stanford Children's
Convalescent Hospital, the Santa
Clara County Health Department,
Veteran's Administration Hospital
in Palo Alto, and the Naval
Hospital in Oakland.
Expanded Role
The expanding role of the
nurse, together with an increased
need for nurses, offers the nursing
student many challenging
professional positions following
graduation. The university
educated nurse may choose to
work as a staff nurse in a hospital
or in a clinical specialty area, such
as psychiatric or intensive care
nursing. The nurse may also go on

to study for a Master's or a
Doctorate.
As people come to realize that
everyone deserves health care and
not just those who can afford it,
nurses are participating with
others in the health professions,
through various government and
private health care facilities, to
deliver health care and health
education to all the people.
During the summers students
have a chance to pursue their
career interests. Many work in
hospitals, and this summer, one
student, interested in nursing on
an international level, will be
going to Tanzania to participate in
a work project; another will be
working with Mexican-Americans
in ao OEO-sponsored health
project in King City.
Future
In order to determine the
future role of nursing education at
Stanford, a comprehensive Study
of Nursing Education is now
underway. The whole faculty of
the Nursing School and interested
and committed students have now
become involved in this study.
Some of the issues to be
considered are: the rationale for
the present baccalaureate program
at Stanford and the possibility of
establishing a graduate program in
nursing; the relation of nursing
education to medical education,
to other health science programs,
to nursing administration, and to
the community; and
determination of the admissions
and recruitment policies for the
School, and the special need to
recruit minority students.
Like the SES, the Study of
Nursing Education at Stanford,
will be an in-depth study, lasting a
year or more, with enthusiastic
faculty and students determined
to develop to the fullest Stanford
Nursing School's particular
position as part of the medical
school and medical center and to
offer a truly outstanding program
to meet the nursing needs of the
future.
