# Student Play Premieres
## 'Hercules' Rewritten 
### 
A musical burlesque of a tragic
play, "Mourning Hercules" by
Stanford student Howard Brown,
will open at 8 p.m. May 28 for four
performances in The Little Theater
at Stanford. The drama will
continue nightly until May 31.
"Mourning Hercules" is a play
within a play where clowns
perform a tragedy of the Hercules
myth. An actor who wants to make
the drama he is rehersing more
socially relevant rebels against the
director. The play, he feels, has
degenerated into a comic parody of
its original powerful form. In his
struggle for control of the
production through persuasion,
song, dance, and violence, the actor

becomes the hero of his
imagination.
Brown, a second year Master of
Fine Arts student in directing,
considers playwrighting his first
interest. A prolific writer, he has
seen eight of his plays produced in
universities and community
theaters.
Premiere
"Mourning Hercules" was
written two years ago while Brown
was a student at Indiana
University. There it was first
performed by the Vest Pocket
Players, a coffee house theater
group which Brown helped form.
At Stanford, the drama has gone

through final revisions during
rehearsal and, in its present form,
will be receiving its premiere in this
Stanford production.
This is the second of his plays
Brown has directed at Stanford.
"Gargoyle" was presented last
spring in Memorial Church.
"There is a tremendous outlet
and interest here at Stanford for
experimental theater," said Brown.
"Actually the directing experience
is the best playwrighting course
one can have. The student comes to
understand, in practical and
literary terms, the strengths and
weaknesses of a play."
Brechtian Type Music
The music in "Mourning
Hercules" was composed by Kevin
Kline, a student at Indiana
University. Songs interrupt the
play, Brechtian fashion, to
illustrate a point. The music is
light, entertaining, and is a take-off
on the American musical comedy
form.
Brown has also designed the
setting and costumes for his play.
Choreography is by Reba Waters
and musical direction is by Andros
Thomson.
Actors playing major characters
in the play are Pauline Adams,
Mary Dahl, Beverly Galley, Roger
Kozol, Andros Thomson, Luke
Vania, and Sigourney Weaver.


CLOWNING AROUND are Andros Thomson and Pauline Adams who appear in
"Mourning Hercules," written and directed by Stanford graduate student Howard
Brown. The Speech and Drama Department production will play at 8 p.m.
Wednesday through Saturday (May 28-31) in the Little Theater on campus.

Brown. The Speech and Drama Department production will play at 8 p.m.
Wednesday through Saturday (May 28-31) in the Little Theater on campus.
Tickets are Sl.OO at the door.
A musical burlesque of a tragic
play, "Mourning Hercules" by
Stanford student Howard Brown,
will open at 8 p.m. May 28 for four
performances in The Little Theater
at Stanford. The drama will
continue nightly until May 31.
"Mourning Hercules" is a play
within a play where clowns
perform a tragedy of the Hercules
myth. An actor who wants to make
the drama he is rehersing more
socially relevant rebels against the
director. The play, he feels, has
degenerated into a comic parody of
its original powerful form. In his
struggle for control of the
production through persuasion,
song, dance, and violence, the actor

becomes the hero of his
imagination.
Brown, a second year Master of
Fine Arts student in directing,
considers playwrighting his first
interest. A prolific writer, he has
seen eight of his plays produced in
universities and community
theaters.
Premiere
"Mourning Hercules" was
written two years ago while Brown
was a student at Indiana
University. There it was first
performed by the Vest Pocket
Players, a coffee house theater
group which Brown helped form.
At Stanford, the drama has gone

through final revisions during
rehearsal and, in its present form,
will be receiving its premiere in this
Stanford production.
This is the second of his plays
Brown has directed at Stanford.
"Gargoyle" was presented last
spring in Memorial Church.
"There is a tremendous outlet
and interest here at Stanford for
experimental theater," said Brown.
"Actually the directing experience
is the best playwrighting course
one can have. The student comes to
understand, in practical and
literary terms, the strengths and
weaknesses of a play."
Brechtian Type Music
The music in "Mourning
Hercules" was composed by Kevin
Kline, a student at Indiana
University. Songs interrupt the
play, Brechtian fashion, to
illustrate a point. The music is
light, entertaining, and is a take-off
on the American musical comedy
form.
Brown has also designed the
setting and costumes for his play.
Choreography is by Reba Waters
and musical direction is by Andros
Thomson.
Actors playing major characters
in the play are Pauline Adams,
Mary Dahl, Beverly Galley, Roger
Kozol, Andros Thomson, Luke
Vania, and Sigourney Weaver.


CLOWNING AROUND are Andros Thomson and Pauline Adams who appear in
"Mourning Hercules," written and directed by Stanford graduate student Howard
Brown. The Speech and Drama Department production will play at 8 p.m.
