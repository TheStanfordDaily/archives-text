## Sex: 'I Am Curious'And'Vixen!' 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Bluntly, the principle issue at
hand and the only possible
attraction to two new films, I Am
Curious (Yellow) and Vixen!, is
raw, explicit sex. Though these
films may upset the puritans in
any community, both make no
bones about the subject and
epidermal exposure is taken for
granted.
The difference is that I Am
Curious attempts to justify and
subjugate its erotic content under
the dubious pretext of "art" with
an ulterior motive while Vixen!
hits you with a hard,
straightforward jab right in the
guts (or some other vital area).
I Am Curious has become a
major cause celebre in film circles
and will eventually make more
money than any other film ever
imported to the states. During its
year-long struggle in the high
courts, its distributor, Grove
Press, flooded bookstores with
profusely illustrated copies of the
script. Upon the film's release this
spring in New York, lines blocks
long could be seen daily at the
theatres. Furthermore, critics who
had defended the picture in court,
Stanley Kauffman among them,
returned to blast it in print.
Clearly, legality and artistry are
two different things but in this

case, arguments over what is legal
and what is artistic have resulted
in what our bureaucratic crusaders
for morality fear most:
exploitation and sensationalism in
grandiose proportions.
As a viewing experience, I Am
Curious is indescribably dull; the
sex scenes are so unexciting that
one doesn't even look forward to
them in the interims. The titularly
inferred curiosity is that of a
young Swedish girl trying to
discover what politics, sex and life
in her country are all about. There
are many on-the-street interviews
with supposedly typical Swedes
and several intrusions into the
mise en scene by the director,
cameraman, crew, et. al., just to
make sure we know we are
watching a film (that is, if we are
still awake or haven't left, as I saw
many viewers do). The most
interesting sequence involves a
speech being given by Martin
Luther King, with the citizens
commenting (before his death)
that "he is a good man."
Director Vilgot Sjoman
apparently rests most of his hopes
for the film on the suspected
luminosity and appeal of his
female lead, but she is a plump
little ugly duckling with minimal
screen presence. As for the sex
scenes, they are all passionlessly
simulated. The result is a
thoroughly limp, short-winded
picture. The book was better.
On the other hand, Russ
Meyer's Vixen! is a strong,
full-bodied film that accomplishes
everything it sets out to do and
then some. Its mind is on SEX
throughout and takes full
advantage of the subject's
possibilities.

Practically all of the success of
Vixen! can be attributed to Russ
Meyer, for he is his own producer,
director, writer and cameraman.
Meyer's attitude toward film
making is simpleâ€”"l make
pictures that turn me on."
However, he also takes special
care in production, spending up to
$200,000 on a project (far above
the average for such films),
filming in good color on location
(in this case, British Columbia)
and choosing attractive and
sometimes talented actors to fill

the roles. He is without question
the only artist in the sexploitation
field.
Vixen herself is a well-endowed
creature (woman or animal?, the
ads ask) who invariably makes it
with anyone she runs into. If it's
not her husband, it's her brother
or her husband's friend or her
husband's friend's wife. The only
one she won't touch is the local
black man, in Canada avoiding the
draft. The result of this
relationship is a near-brilliant
scene in a hijacked private plane
headed for Cuba in which Vixen
and the black stud verbally
demolish each other. In this
context, the film not only

comments about sex but racial
relations and plane hijacking.
I haven't meant to build
Vixen! into a great film but what
is refreshing about it is the
healthy attitude taken toward
sexual relations (as compared to
no attitude in I Am Curious).
Each erotic encounter is depicted
as a fun experience and is
titilating in a carefree, joyous
manner; one doesn't feel that he is
watching utterly cheap, degraded
people or is being conned by some
clever guy out to make a fast
buck. Russ Meyer clearly enjoys
his work and sees no reason why
we shouldn't take pleasure in it as
well.
