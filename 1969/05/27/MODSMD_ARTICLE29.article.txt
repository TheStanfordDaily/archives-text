# Comments Welcome
## Library Addition On Display 
### HERBERT TERRY 
This week and next may be the
last chance for members of the
Stanford community to
significantly influence the design
of the $20.2 million addition to
the Main Library.
Plans for the project, outside
of SLAC the largest ever
attempted by the University, will
be displayed today (Tuesday) in
the lobby of the Main Library
from 1:00 to 5:00. On Thursday
they will move to the lobby of
Meyer Library and be displayed

from 9:00 to 5:00. Monday, June
2, the display will be in the
Faculty Club from 11:00 to 2:00.
Student, faculty and library
staff members of the
Subcommittee on Building will
man the displays to answer
questions and receive comments.
In addition, copies of the plans
have been sent to most members
of the Academic Council, and
have been posted in dorms.
According to Assistant
Director of University Libraries
David Weber, plans for the

structure are now in a 'completed
design development stage. He
notes that "it is obviously not
now feasible to make complete
changes in major design features
or functions of the building.
Comments Needed
The working drawings could be
finished as early as New Year's,
1970. Since so much work will be
done by the architects over the
summer, Weber adds that "the
more comments we get at this
time, the better will be the result
of the final plans."
He sees the apportioning of
spaces, the alignment of traffic
patterns and the subdivisions of
spaces as the three areas most
likely to be reevaluated as a result
of community reaction to the
plans.
Students, faculty and members
of the library staff have been
working on the addition since
January 1965 when a staff study
of space needs for the Main
Library was completed. The result
of their work is a 5-story building
of some 200,000 square feet,
designed in the shape of a very
flat pyramid, covered with roof
gardens and housing over 2
million volumes.
4 Problems Solved
The new building is designed to
solve four long-standing problems:
the need for more space for
graduate collections, the need for
more and better seating for
graduates and advanced
undergraduates, the lack of
faculty studies, and the increasing
lack of room for staff functions.
Seating for over 1,200 students
is built into the stack areas. In
addition, the plans call for 137
dissertation rooms to be assigned
to graduate students completing
their dissertation, 246 private
faculty studies, six eight-person
group study rooms, and seven
typing rooms with space for two
students.

of space needs for the Main
Library was completed. The result
of their work is a 5-story building
of some 200,000 square feet,
designed in the shape of a very
flat pyramid, covered with roof
gardens and housing over 2
million volumes.
4 Problems Solved
The new building is designed to
solve four long-standing problems:
the need for more space for
graduate collections, the need for
more and better seating for
graduates and advanced
undergraduates, the lack of
faculty studies, and the increasing
lack of room for staff functions.
Seating for over 1,200 students
is built into the stack areas. In
addition, the plans call for 137
dissertation rooms to be assigned
to graduate students completing
their dissertation, 246 private
faculty studies, six eight-person
group study rooms, and seven
typing rooms with space for two
students.
This week and next may be the
last chance for members of the
Stanford community to
significantly influence the design
of the $20.2 million addition to
the Main Library.
Plans for the project, outside
of SLAC the largest ever
attempted by the University, will
be displayed today (Tuesday) in
the lobby of the Main Library
from 1:00 to 5:00. On Thursday
they will move to the lobby of
Meyer Library and be displayed

from 9:00 to 5:00. Monday, June
2, the display will be in the
Faculty Club from 11:00 to 2:00.
Student, faculty and library
staff members of the
Subcommittee on Building will
man the displays to answer
questions and receive comments.
In addition, copies of the plans
have been sent to most members
of the Academic Council, and
have been posted in dorms.
According to Assistant
Director of University Libraries
David Weber, plans for the

structure are now in a 'completed
design development stage. He
notes that "it is obviously not
now feasible to make complete
changes in major design features
or functions of the building.
Comments Needed
The working drawings could be
finished as early as New Year's,
1970. Since so much work will be
done by the architects over the
summer, Weber adds that "the
more comments we get at this
time, the better will be the result
of the final plans."
He sees the apportioning of
spaces, the alignment of traffic
patterns and the subdivisions of
spaces as the three areas most
likely to be reevaluated as a result
of community reaction to the
plans.
Students, faculty and members
of the library staff have been
working on the addition since
January 1965 when a staff study
of space needs for the Main
Library was completed. The result
of their work is a 5-story building
of some 200,000 square feet,
designed in the shape of a very
flat pyramid, covered with roof
gardens and housing over 2
