## Spacemen Safe, Head Home 
### 
The astronauts halted their physical
examination briefly to talk in private
with President Nixon calling from the
White House yesterday after returning
safely from their journey.
The President called the flight "a
proud moment for the country" and
then talked with each crewman.
A preliminary medical report
indicated the spacemen were in
excellent condition.
"They have a little skin irritation
which happens on many of the
spaceflights," said a doctor. "It's not
severe and I don't think it'll be any
problem "
After cutting a cake decorated with
space symbols the Astronauts took off
for Pago Pago in American Samoa.
They were to board a jet transport in.
Pago Pago and begin the long, 14-hour
flight to Ellington Air Force Base near
Houston. Arrival at Ellington, where
they'll reunite with their families, is
expected on Tuesday.
Experts steering Americans to the
moon said Monday the three Apollo 10
astronauts "have given us the final
confidence" to aim toward a lunar
landing July 20.
But if preparations get behind
schedule, "we will not hesitate to
postpone the Apollo 11 mission" until
August, said Dr. Thomas O. Paine,
administrator of the Nation Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

who was buried alive for four days last
December.
It was a victory for Krist's two
court-appointed lawyers who had
fought for his life in the seven-day trial.
Dist. Atty. Richard Bell had asked for
the death penalty.
Krist, 24, a convicted car thief and
prison escapee, had predicted the death
penalty before the case went to the
jury.
Miss Mackle, daughter of millionaire
Florida land developer Robert F.
Mackle, was kidnaped Dec. 17. She was
freed only after her family paid the
$500,000 ransom.
Krist was arrested on an island off
Florida's west coast four days after the
kidnaping.
Also charged in the kidnaping is
Ruth Eisenmann Schier, a 26-year-old
former graduate student in biology and
the first woman ever to make the FBl's
10 "most wanted' -criminal list. Miss
Eisemann Schier, arrested in March at
Norman, Okla. faces trial in June.
Ray Denied a New Trial
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)—James Earl
Ray was denied a new trial Monday in
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.
Judge Arthur C. Faquin Jr. ruled that
Ray's March 10 guilty plea to the
slaying closed the door on another trial,
an appeal or any other type of post
conviction action by the defense.
In addition, Faquin held, Ray had
signed voluntarily a waiver of these
rights and had stated in open court he

did so with full understanding and at his
own free will.
J.B. Stoner of Savannah, Ga., one of
Ray's three attorneys, noted an
exception to the decision. Later, he told
newsmen that "some moves" would be
made by the defense team, but he said
just what moves would be made —and
when —had not been decided.

Election For L.A. Mayor
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Thomas
Bradley, a Negro city councilman
leading in the polls, and Sam
Yorty, showing some gain battling
to hold his job, made final victory
predictions Monday as Los
Angeles voters prepared to choose
a mayor.
Up to 75 percent of the city's
1.27 million registered voters will
probably go to the polls Tuesday
in the climax of one of the city's
most bitter elections.
If Bradley wins, he owuld
become one of the nation's most
influential Negro political figures
as mayor of the third most
populous city. Gary, Ind., and
Cleveland, Ohio, also have Negro
mayors.
Los Angeles' Negro population
is estimated at 15 to 20 percent.
Jet Hijacked to Cuba
MIAMI (AP)—A jittery hijacker
held a gun to a stewardess' head
Monday and threatened to cause a
Northeast Airlines jet carrying 20

persons to crash into the sea
unless the pilot, husband of the
stewardess, diverted the plane to
Cuba.
Two other hijackers, one
brandishing a pistol, kept watch
over 11 other passengers as the
Miami-to-New York airliner
became the 27 th commercial
flight hijacked to Cuba this year.
Viet Nam
WASHINGTON (AP)-White
House sources said flatly today
the United States has not
escalated the Vietnam war since
President Nixon assumed office
and, that recent increases in
American casualties are a direct
result of an enemy offensive.
"The number of battalion sized
American operations has not
increased since last November,"
the sources said. "It has been
substantially constant."
Any de-escalation of the
Vietnam War short of actual troop
withdrawals from the battlefields
would be so complicated as to be
impossible to carry out, according
to White House sources.
So, the sources indicated, there
appears little prospect for
reducing the war's scale as long as
Hanoi refuses a mutual troop
pullout and enemy attacks
continue.
After the ruling, Faquin
ordered that Ray be returned to
his maximum-security cell in the

MIAMI (AP)—A jittery hijacker
held a gun to a stewardess' head
Monday and threatened to cause a
Northeast Airlines jet carrying 20

persons to crash into the sea
unless the pilot, husband of the
stewardess, diverted the plane to

Viet Nam
WASHINGTON (AP)-White
House sources said flatly today
the United States has not
escalated the Vietnam war since
President Nixon assumed office
and, that recent increases in
American casualties are a direct
result of an enemy offensive.
"The number of battalion sized
American operations has not
increased since last November,"
the sources said. "It has been
substantially constant."
Any de-escalation of the
Vietnam War short of actual troop
withdrawals from the battlefields
would be so complicated as to be
impossible to carry out, according
to White House sources.
So, the sources indicated, there
appears little prospect for
reducing the war's scale as long as
Hanoi refuses a mutual troop
pullout and enemy attacks
continue.
The astronauts halted their physical
examination briefly to talk in private
with President Nixon calling from the
White House yesterday after returning
safely from their journey.
The President called the flight "a
proud moment for the country" and
then talked with each crewman.
A preliminary medical report
indicated the spacemen were in
excellent condition.
"They have a little skin irritation
which happens on many of the
spaceflights," said a doctor. "It's not
severe and I don't think it'll be any
problem "
After cutting a cake decorated with
space symbols the Astronauts took off
for Pago Pago in American Samoa.
They were to board a jet transport in.
Pago Pago and begin the long, 14-hour
flight to Ellington Air Force Base near
Houston. Arrival at Ellington, where
they'll reunite with their families, is
expected on Tuesday.
Experts steering Americans to the
moon said Monday the three Apollo 10
astronauts "have given us the final
confidence" to aim toward a lunar
landing July 20.
But if preparations get behind
schedule, "we will not hesitate to
postpone the Apollo 11 mission" until
August, said Dr. Thomas O. Paine,
administrator of the Nation Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

who was buried alive for four days last
December.
It was a victory for Krist's two
court-appointed lawyers who had
fought for his life in the seven-day trial.
Dist. Atty. Richard Bell had asked for
the death penalty.
Krist, 24, a convicted car thief and
prison escapee, had predicted the death
penalty before the case went to the
jury.
Miss Mackle, daughter of millionaire
Florida land developer Robert F.
Mackle, was kidnaped Dec. 17. She was
freed only after her family paid the
$500,000 ransom.
Krist was arrested on an island off
Florida's west coast four days after the
kidnaping.
Also charged in the kidnaping is
Ruth Eisenmann Schier, a 26-year-old
former graduate student in biology and
the first woman ever to make the FBl's
10 "most wanted' -criminal list. Miss
Eisemann Schier, arrested in March at

Ray Denied a New Trial
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)—James Earl
Ray was denied a new trial Monday in
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther

Judge Arthur C. Faquin Jr. ruled that
Ray's March 10 guilty plea to the
slaying closed the door on another trial,
an appeal or any other type of post
conviction action by the defense.
In addition, Faquin held, Ray had
signed voluntarily a waiver of these
rights and had stated in open court he

did so with full understanding and at his
own free will.
J.B. Stoner of Savannah, Ga., one of
Ray's three attorneys, noted an
exception to the decision. Later, he told
newsmen that "some moves" would be
made by the defense team, but he said
just what moves would be made —and
when —had not been decided.
After the ruling, Faquin
ordered that Ray be returned to
his maximum-security cell in the
state penitentiary at Nashville to
continue serving his 99-year term.

Ray Denied a New Trial
MEMPHIS, Tenn. (AP)—James Earl
Ray was denied a new trial Monday in
the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King Jr.
Judge Arthur C. Faquin Jr. ruled that
Ray's March 10 guilty plea to the
slaying closed the door on another trial,
an appeal or any other type of post
conviction action by the defense.
In addition, Faquin held, Ray had
signed voluntarily a waiver of these
rights and had stated in open court he

did so with full understanding and at his
own free will.
J.B. Stoner of Savannah, Ga., one of
Ray's three attorneys, noted an
exception to the decision. Later, he told
newsmen that "some moves" would be
made by the defense team, but he said
just what moves would be made —and
when —had not been decided.
After the ruling, Faquin
ordered that Ray be returned to
his maximum-security cell in the
state penitentiary at Nashville to
continue serving his 99-year term.

Northeast Airlines jet carrying 20

persons to crash into the sea
unless the pilot, husband of the
stewardess, diverted the plane to

Viet Nam
WASHINGTON (AP)-White
House sources said flatly today
the United States has not
escalated the Vietnam war since
President Nixon assumed office
and, that recent increases in
American casualties are a direct
result of an enemy offensive.
"The number of battalion sized
American operations has not
increased since last November,"
the sources said. "It has been
substantially constant."
Any de-escalation of the
Vietnam War short of actual troop
withdrawals from the battlefields
would be so complicated as to be
impossible to carry out, according
to White House sources.
So, the sources indicated, there
appears little prospect for
reducing the war's scale as long as
Hanoi refuses a mutual troop
pullout and enemy attacks
continue.
The astronauts halted their physical
examination briefly to talk in private
with President Nixon calling from the
White House yesterday after returning
safely from their journey.
The President called the flight "a
proud moment for the country" and
then talked with each crewman.
A preliminary medical report
indicated the spacemen were in
excellent condition.
"They have a little skin irritation
which happens on many of the
spaceflights," said a doctor. "It's not
severe and I don't think it'll be any
problem "
After cutting a cake decorated with
space symbols the Astronauts took off
for Pago Pago in American Samoa.
They were to board a jet transport in.
Pago Pago and begin the long, 14-hour
flight to Ellington Air Force Base near
Houston. Arrival at Ellington, where
they'll reunite with their families, is
expected on Tuesday.
Experts steering Americans to the
moon said Monday the three Apollo 10
astronauts "have given us the final
confidence" to aim toward a lunar
landing July 20.
But if preparations get behind
schedule, "we will not hesitate to
postpone the Apollo 11 mission" until
August, said Dr. Thomas O. Paine,
administrator of the Nation Aeronautics
and Space Administration.

who was buried alive for four days last
December.
It was a victory for Krist's two
court-appointed lawyers who had
fought for his life in the seven-day trial.
Dist. Atty. Richard Bell had asked for
the death penalty.
Krist, 24, a convicted car thief and
prison escapee, had predicted the death
penalty before the case went to the
jury.

Mackle, was kidnaped Dec. 17. She was
