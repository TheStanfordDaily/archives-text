# Objectivist Ethics
## Moral Severity Hit 
### ROGER REED 
"Whenever you have a
comprehensive philosophy, there
will always be some people who
will jump on this intellectual
bandwagon for reasons that have
no relation to truth or sanity,"
according to Nathaniel B'randen.
Branden, former associate of
Ayn Rand and an advocate of the
philosophy of Objectivism, spoke
at Bishop Auditorium last night to
about 225 people. His lecture,

entitled "Common Errors in the
Practical Application of the
Objectivist Ethics," was sponsored
by the Society of New
Intellectuals at Stanford.
Branden warned of "the
dangers of converting a set of
ideas into a religion." He said it
could lead to "weird explosions of
hostility and moral severity"
directed toward outsiders or
deviates. Reminding his audience
of "the enormous intellectual
responsibility of passing moral
judgments," he said: "It is not to
be done lightly or hysterically."
"Morbid Guilt"
He also cautioned against
"morbid guilt" of having deviated
from Objectivism. Branden noted
"the communist-purge-like fear of
being accused and the ferocious
quickness to accuse on the other
hand to establish one's ideological
purity."
Branden recently terminated his
relationship with Ayn Rand, the
author of Atlas Shrugged, The

Fountainhead and The Virtue of
Selfishness. According to Branden,
Miss Rand felt that he was "too
tolerant" and attacked his "moral
deterioration."
Cancelled Subscriptions
In a lengthy question-and-ans
wer period, Branden gave several
examples of persons who had had
their subscriptions to the
Objectivist magazine cancelled by
Ayn Rand after they hac
questioned her . Branden asked,
"This is Objectivism?'
He added that he did not
"admire" the Young Americans for
Freedom (YAF): "I don't want to
have anything to do with that
organization."
Branden declared: "I am firmly
opposed to any attempt to tie
capitalism with religion. Capitalism
is perfectly capable of a rational
defense." lie said, "The National
Review approach to capitalism
plays into the hands" of those who
oppose free enterprise.
