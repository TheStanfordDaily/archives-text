# Forty-Six Professors Call For March, Vigil
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
Forty-six faculty members have
invited all segments of the Stanford
community to join them Memorial
Day in a sunrise to sunset "CALL TO
ACTION FOR THE SURVIVAL OF
HUMANITY." Among other
activities, participants will march to
the industrial park in a wreath laying
ceremony.
The sponsors of the protest have
sent letters to the 900 members of
the Academic Council asking them to
join in what they call "A TIME FOR
TURNING."
The letter says:"It has been a
disturbing year —a year of conflict,
uncertainty and violence. Men die in
Vietnam . . . and Berkeley. There is
violence in Saigon . . . and Palo Alto.
Budgets to increase military might
rise, budgets to rehabilitate the
ghettos are slashed ....
' We desperately need 'a time for
turning,' to recover our sense of
direction, to channel the moral

outrage we feel, to reestablish
priorities for the future."
The day long meeting begins at
6:00 a.m. in Memorial Church.
During the early morning hours the
participants "will try to get some
perspective on what has been
happening to us and why we have
been so ineffective."
March Begins
At about 10:30 the group will
begin a march "to commemorate the
dead and to acknowledge our
complicity in their deaths." The
procession will circle the quadrangle
arcade before continuing to the
Stanford Industrial Park.
A wreath will be laid in the
middle of the industrial complex "to
symbolize the fact that all around us
is a society that produces both the
expertise and the instruments of
destruction that make modern war
feasible and even encourage it."
Another wreath will be placed in the
middle of the quadrangle on the
return to the chapel.
During the remainder of the
afternoon participants will focus on
alternatives to present goals and
priorities. Small talk groups, films,
discussions and short presentations

will be devoted to "specific ways to
move beyond indecisiveness in
relation to things as diverse but
interrelated as opposition to the
ABM missile system, restructuring of
the Board of Trustees, war research,
effective means of producing
change."
Fast and Meal
Sponsors of the program will fast
throughout the day before
concluding with a common meal at
sunset. Those who do not wish to
fast, or who can attend only part of
the day's proceedings, are urged to
come at any time.
Dean Davie Napier, one of the
sponsors, has telegramed university
chaplains at other major universities.
He asks them to: "Join Stanford in
(acuity-initiated dawn to sunset
fasting vigil Memorial Day to play
action for survival of humanity
(ASH). Join this'day of Turning' and
pass the word."

sponsors, has telegramed university
chaplains at other major universities.
He asks them to: "Join Stanford in
(acuity-initiated dawn to sunset
fasting vigil Memorial Day to play
action for survival of humanity
(ASH). Join this'day of Turning' and
pass the word."
Forty-six faculty members have
invited all segments of the Stanford
community to join them Memorial
Day in a sunrise to sunset "CALL TO
ACTION FOR THE SURVIVAL OF
HUMANITY." Among other
activities, participants will march to
the industrial park in a wreath laying
ceremony.
The sponsors of the protest have
sent letters to the 900 members of
the Academic Council asking them to
join in what they call "A TIME FOR
TURNING."
The letter says:"It has been a
disturbing year —a year of conflict,
uncertainty and violence. Men die in
Vietnam . . . and Berkeley. There is
violence in Saigon . . . and Palo Alto.
Budgets to increase military might
rise, budgets to rehabilitate the
ghettos are slashed ....
' We desperately need 'a time for
turning,' to recover our sense of
direction, to channel the moral

outrage we feel, to reestablish
priorities for the future."
The day long meeting begins at
6:00 a.m. in Memorial Church.
During the early morning hours the
participants "will try to get some
perspective on what has been
happening to us and why we have
been so ineffective."
March Begins
At about 10:30 the group will
begin a march "to commemorate the
dead and to acknowledge our
complicity in their deaths." The
procession will circle the quadrangle
arcade before continuing to the
Stanford Industrial Park.
A wreath will be laid in the
middle of the industrial complex "to
symbolize the fact that all around us
is a society that produces both the
expertise and the instruments of
destruction that make modern war
feasible and even encourage it."
Another wreath will be placed in the
middle of the quadrangle on the
return to the chapel.
During the remainder of the
afternoon participants will focus on
alternatives to present goals and
priorities. Small talk groups, films,
discussions and short presentations

will be devoted to "specific ways to
move beyond indecisiveness in
relation to things as diverse but
interrelated as opposition to the
ABM missile system, restructuring of
the Board of Trustees, war research,
effective means of producing
change."
Fast and Meal
Sponsors of the program will fast
throughout the day before
concluding with a common meal at
sunset. Those who do not wish to
fast, or who can attend only part of
the day's proceedings, are urged to
come at any time.
