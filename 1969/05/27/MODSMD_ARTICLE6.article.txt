# LASSU Tackles Budget
## 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
The Legislature, convening with 102
of the 136 members in attendance, last
night again grappled with the proposed
$137,600 budget for next year.
A walk out by approximately 20
LASSU members failed to reduce the
body below the number necessary for a
quorum as similar attempts during two
previous meetings had.
The incident was sparked by a 66 to
40 vote, short of the two-thirds
necessary to amend the orders of the
day, to consider the budget
appropriations for a number of student
organizations. Included in the
compromise motion were the Black
Students Union (BSU), Pre-Reg
Commission, Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Atzlan (MECHA),
Population and Environment Forum,
Political Union, Psychology Club, and
Axe Com.
A motion by Council of Presidents
member John Grube to delay
consideration of the budget until next
fall by the 40-member senate also failed.
ASSU Financial Manager Dave Swift
announced, "If nothing is done by the
Legislature this year, those
organizations that have to have funds
during the first part of the year will be
granted whatever funds deemed
necessary by President Pitzer, in
consultation with me, the ASSU
president, the finance committee, and
the persons from the appropriate
organization."
Prior to the consideration of the
budget question, LASSU agreed to the
constitutions of the Population and
Environment Forum, MECHA, and the
Psychology Club.
Three students were named to one
year terms on the seven-member
committee on nominations, which is
chaired by the ASSU president in an
ex-officio capacity. Those students
include: John Grant, a junior in political
science; Neal Reay, a first year student
in the Graduate School of Business; and
Nate Kirtman, a senior student in
psychology.
