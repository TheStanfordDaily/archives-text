# 300 Discuss Berkeley At P. A. Gathering
## 
### LANG ATWOOD 
About 300 people gathered in
downtown Palo Alto yesterday evening
to listen to speakers discuss the crisis at
Berkeley, Stanford Research Institute,
and the problems facing the Free
University at a rally organized by the
Free U.
The rally was held in "The Plaza,"
formerly Lytton Plaza, at the corner of
Emerson and University. It attracted a
mixed crowd that included Stanford
students, high school students, local
residents and passers-by.
Bob the coordinator of
the Free U., began the rally shortly after
eight by reading a number of quotations
about the Berkeley situation from
various sources both radical and
conservative. He then introduced Lyn
Cornell, a real estate broker, who
moderated the gathering.
Cornell explained that he was not
anti-establishment but was for
constructive change.
"I'm a pacifist, I'm anti-war,
anti-racist and for open housing. I'm not
a rightist or a leftist. I generally support
the Democratic Party. I'm over 30, over

50, but I believe that the excitement of
today is in your generation.' L
The first speaker at the open
microphones was Marc Heller, a
suspended student and member of SDS
and the April 3rd Movement at
Stanford.
Heller said tha universities don't use
their land to provide the facilities that
the university community wants. He
also hinted at the possibility of
establishing a "people's park" in the
Stanford Industrial Park.
Cullenbine then said that there was
an issue similar to "people's park" in
this area—the controversy surrounding
the use of El Camino Park for Free U.
be-ins.
During the debate which raged for
several hours, Roy Kepler, owner of
Kepler's bookstores and a pacifist,
spoke against polarizing the community.
"Are we going to change it (local
regulations) non-violently or are we
going to blow the whole thing up
because we are incapable of reasonable,
loving action?" he asked.
