## What Ever Happened To'The Row'? 
### SUSAN SWARD 
.The sparest definition of "the Row"
is "a geographic area of the Stanford
campus including the roads of Lasuen
Street and Mayfield .Avenue where the
fraternity and old sorority houses sit."
But in a broader context, "the Row"
designates more than a geographic area.
While several of the fraternity houses
have been torn down and rebuilt in
other areas of the campus, and while all
the sororities were converted during
World War II into university-run, female
housing, there still exists on the Row a
flavor of the atmosphere of by-gone
days at Stanford.
Most of the houses are showing signs
of age. There are attractive,
old-fashioned lainp-posts lining part of
the Row, and along much of the street
stand tall, leafy trees that drop large
quantities of leaves onto the pavement
in the fall.
Cenler of Controversy
Viewing this peaceful setting, it is
hard to imagine that the Row could
have ever been a center of controversy
on the campus, but during World War II
the Row was just that—a center of
controversy.
Past copies of The Stanford Daily
indicate that the pressure to get rid of
the sororities at Stanford mounted
steadily during the 1930's and climaxed
in the early 1940's when a group of
Roble sponsors organised a number of

students in an effort to have the
sororities turn their charters in to the
national chapters.
The Roble sponsors further urged
that "the university take over the
houses now occupied by sororities and
assume any obligations there entailed."
The inter-sorority council at Stanford
responded by setting up a committee to
study the sponsors' recommendations.
This committee came to the
conclusion that the sorority system at
Stanford would either have to be
expanded so that more girls could join
the houses, or it would have to be done
away with completely. Discontent with
the system as it stood came primarily
from the fact that only one out of every
three girls at Stanford was allowed to
join a sorority while many more than
that number wished to join.
The plan to do away with the
sorority system completely was
eventually adopted by the committee
and implemented by the university, so
that the Stanford sorority system met
with its demise before the close of
World War 11.
According to past Daily copies and
to one other reliable source, an
administrator who was involved with
the residence system at that time, the
rumors are not true that a girl threw
herself off Hoover Tower or hung
herself in front of a sororitv that did
