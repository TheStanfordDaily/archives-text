# Many Changes
## What Ever Happened To'The Row'? 
### SUSAN SWARD 
.The sparest definition of "the Row"
is "a geographic area of the Stanford
campus including the roads of Lasuen
Street and Mayfield .Avenue where the
fraternity and old sorority houses sit."
But in a broader context, "the Row"
designates more than a geographic area.
While several of the fraternity houses
have been torn down and rebuilt in
other areas of the campus, and while all
the sororities were converted during
World War II into university-run, female
housing, there still exists on the Row a
flavor of the atmosphere of by-gone
days at Stanford.
Most of the houses are showing signs
of age. There are attractive,
old-fashioned lainp-posts lining part of
the Row, and along much of the street
stand tall, leafy trees that drop large
quantities of leaves onto the pavement
in the fall.
Cenler of Controversy
Viewing this peaceful setting, it is
hard to imagine that the Row could
have ever been a center of controversy
on the campus, but during World War II
the Row was just that—a center of
controversy.
Past copies of The Stanford Daily
indicate that the pressure to get rid of
the sororities at Stanford mounted
steadily during the 1930's and climaxed
in the early 1940's when a group of
Roble sponsors organised a number of

students in an effort to have the
sororities turn their charters in to the
national chapters.
The Roble sponsors further urged
that "the university take over the
houses now occupied by sororities and
assume any obligations there entailed."
The inter-sorority council at Stanford
responded by setting up a committee to
study the sponsors' recommendations.
This committee came to the
conclusion that the sorority system at
Stanford would either have to be
expanded so that more girls could join
the houses, or it would have to be done
away with completely. Discontent with
the system as it stood came primarily
from the fact that only one out of every
three girls at Stanford was allowed to
join a sorority while many more than
that number wished to join.
The plan to do away with the
sorority system completely was
eventually adopted by the committee
and implemented by the university, so
that the Stanford sorority system met
with its demise before the close of
World War 11.
According to past Daily copies and
to one other reliable source, an
administrator who was involved with
the residence system at that time, the
rumors are not true that a girl threw
herself off Hoover Tower or hung
herself in front of a sororitv that did

of these rumors is the fact that a
girl did drown in Lake Lagunita
soon after she was not pledged by
a sorority. It was never clear if the
drowning had been an accident or
an intentional act, however.
Row's Future
In the long-range plans of the
university, much of the Row will
be torn down as the new law
annex is constructed near
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and as
Campus Drive is eventually
widened into a four lane highway.
While the plans are not in a
finalized form, Storey and
Lathrop Houses, the two Row
houses closest to Dinkelspiel and
the center of quad, will probably
be the first houses to be torn
down in the near future. Even
these houses, though, are not
slated to be torn down before
1975 or so.
Given the fact that university
policy today is not presently
oriented toward saving the Row
houses at any cost to the
university, it is interesting to
examine the Row as it stands
today.
Students who don't live in the
university-run houses on the Row,
of which there are five all-female,
two co-ed and two £11-male
houses, often express stereotypic
observations about wha'- life is
like on the Row. The stereotypes
usually charge that the
university-run part of Row is a
bastion of conservatism where
intellectual, politically-conscious
concerns do not thrive.
The "Row dollie" has been
described —particularly in the
past—as about five feet, four
inches tall. She is either a
cheerleader or she is on Ax
Comm, and her goal in life is to
date fraternity boys.
This stereotype of an
anti-intellectual Row inhabited by
fair-haired morons is violently
criticized by many individuals
who live in the university-run
housing on the Row and by

persons in the administration
whose task it is to operate the
financial, structural aspect of the
Row.
Diversity Stressed
The statement made again and
again by these people is that it is
impossible to generalize about the
kind of people who live on the
Row today. Particularly since
Grove House, the co-ed dorm that
Professor Mark Mancall set into
operation three years ago, moved
into two Row houses this last fall,
it is felt that "new blood" has
come to the Row. The fact that
Durand House, formerly an
all-female house, and Mayfield,
formerly the ATO Fraternity's
house, are both all-male this year
is another piece of evidence used
to support the belief on the part
of many individuals that the
Row's character is changing.
Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Row for the last two years,
maintains that all the
university-run houses on the Row
are very different. While she
recognizes that Storey and
Lathrop Houses may have more
problems with raids by fraternity
men, Miss Mack feels that each
house has its individual character,
and each house's character may
even evolve from quarter to
quarter as the population of a
house changes.
Sally Mahoney, Associate Dean
of Students in charge of student
housing, agrees with Miss Mack's

viewpoint that it is very difficult,
if not impossible, to generalize
about girls who live on the Row.
"You can't talk about the
Row," Miss Mahoney said. "The
houses are very diverse."
The Associate Dean of
Students also reiterated a belief of
Miss Mack's that the "Stanford
dollie" can be found in dorms all
over the campus. But Miss
Mahoney doubted if there were
many Stanford dollies left on the
campus. "There isn't much status
left in being a dollie," she
observed.
Many of the house presidents
and resident assistants interviewed
defended the alleged diversity of
Row housing also. The stereotype
of the Row as anti-intellectual was
criticized repeatedly.
The increasing number of
seminars in the university-run
Row houses was mentioned by
several students and
administrators as an indicator that
intellectual activity is increasing
on the Row. One house president
commented that intellectual and
political consciousness is on the
increase all over the campus, and
the Row is simply playing its part
in that increase.
Has Row Evolved?
Speaking to the question of the
alledged evolution in the Row's
character over the years toward a
less conservative residence area of
the campus, many Row residents
stated that they felt that criticism
of a conservative, anti-intellectual
Row was more warranted in past
years than it is today.
One psychological study of
Siegel and Siegel, published in

1957, obtained results that did
not present a very favorable
portrayal of girls living on the
Row at tha time. The study
observed that "the Row and
non-Row social groups differ in
attitude norms, with Row
residents being generally more
authoritarian than non-Row
residents."
The study's conclusion was
formulated after three groups of
Stanford females were tested:
women who had gained
assignment to live on the Row
during their sophomore year and
who did not attempt to draw out
of the Row at the end of that
year; women who had not gained
assignment to a Row house for
sophomore year and who drew for
a Row house again after living in a
non-Row house during the
sophomore year; and women who
had not gained assignment to a
Row house for the sophomore
year, and who chose to remain in
a non-Row house after living in
one during the sophomore year.
On the basis of the data that
they accumulated, the study's
authors concluded that the first
gorup of female students showed
the smallest reduction in
authoritarianism scores, the

second group a larger reduction
and the third group showed the
largest reduction.
Though the validity of the
authoritarian personality
construct is questioned by many
social learning psychologists today
and though much time has elapsed
since the study was completed,
critics of the Row sometimes
quote the Siegel and Siegel study
in support of their argument that
the Row is somehow different
than other areas of the campus
community.
Some of the students
interviewed who were the most
caustic in their observations about
the Row discounted the
applicability of the Siegel and
Siegel study to Row life today.
With the entrance of two all-male
houses and two co-ed houses to
the Row, most individuals,
whether they feel positive, neutral
or negative toward the Row, will
content that the Row today has
been affected by the increasing
diversity of residence choices that
the student has to choose from.
"With the advent of co-ed
housing," said one house
president, "the feeling that the
Row is the place to live has been
dissipated tremendously."

What Happened...?

intellectual, politically-conscious
concerns do not thrive.
The "Row dollie" has been
described —particularly in the
past—as about five feet, four
inches tall. She is either a
cheerleader or she is on Ax
Comm, and her goal in life is to
date fraternity boys.
This stereotype of an
anti-intellectual Row inhabited by
fair-haired morons is violently
criticized by many individuals
who live in the university-run
housing on the Row and by

persons in the administration
whose task it is to operate the
financial, structural aspect of the
Row.
Diversity Stressed
The statement made again and
again by these people is that it is
impossible to generalize about the
kind of people who live on the
Row today. Particularly since
Grove House, the co-ed dorm that
Professor Mark Mancall set into
operation three years ago, moved
into two Row houses this last fall,
it is felt that "new blood" has
come to the Row. The fact that
Durand House, formerly an
all-female house, and Mayfield,
formerly the ATO Fraternity's
house, are both all-male this year
is another piece of evidence used
to support the belief on the part
of many individuals that the
Row's character is changing.
Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Row for the last two years,
maintains that all the
university-run houses on the Row
are very different. While she
recognizes that Storey and
Lathrop Houses may have more
problems with raids by fraternity
men, Miss Mack feels that each
house has its individual character,
and each house's character may
even evolve from quarter to
quarter as the population of a
house changes.
Sally Mahoney, Associate Dean
of Students in charge of student
housing, agrees with Miss Mack's

viewpoint that it is very difficult,
if not impossible, to generalize
about girls who live on the Row.
"You can't talk about the
Row," Miss Mahoney said. "The
houses are very diverse."
The Associate Dean of
Students also reiterated a belief of
Miss Mack's that the "Stanford
dollie" can be found in dorms all
over the campus. But Miss
Mahoney doubted if there were
many Stanford dollies left on the
campus. "There isn't much status
left in being a dollie," she
observed.
Many of the house presidents
and resident assistants interviewed
defended the alleged diversity of
Row housing also. The stereotype
of the Row as anti-intellectual was
criticized repeatedly.
The increasing number of
seminars in the university-run
Row houses was mentioned by
several students and
administrators as an indicator that
intellectual activity is increasing
on the Row. One house president
commented that intellectual and
political consciousness is on the
increase all over the campus, and
the Row is simply playing its part
in that increase.
Has Row Evolved?
Speaking to the question of the
alledged evolution in the Row's
character over the years toward a
less conservative residence area of
the campus, many Row residents
stated that they felt that criticism
of a conservative, anti-intellectual
Row was more warranted in past
years than it is today.
One psychological study of
Siegel and Siegel, published in

1957, obtained results that did
not present a very favorable
portrayal of girls living on the
Row at tha time. The study
observed that "the Row and
non-Row social groups differ in
attitude norms, with Row
residents being generally more
authoritarian than non-Row
residents."
The study's conclusion was
formulated after three groups of
Stanford females were tested:
women who had gained
assignment to live on the Row
during their sophomore year and
who did not attempt to draw out
of the Row at the end of that
year; women who had not gained
assignment to a Row house for
sophomore year and who drew for
a Row house again after living in a
non-Row house during the
sophomore year; and women who
had not gained assignment to a
Row house for the sophomore
year, and who chose to remain in
a non-Row house after living in
one during the sophomore year.
On the basis of the data that
they accumulated, the study's
authors concluded that the first
gorup of female students showed
the smallest reduction in
authoritarianism scores, the

second group a larger reduction
and the third group showed the
largest reduction.
Though the validity of the
authoritarian personality
construct is questioned by many
social learning psychologists today
and though much time has elapsed
since the study was completed,
critics of the Row sometimes
quote the Siegel and Siegel study
in support of their argument that
the Row is somehow different
than other areas of the campus
community.
Some of the students
interviewed who were the most
caustic in their observations about
the Row discounted the
applicability of the Siegel and
Siegel study to Row life today.
With the entrance of two all-male
houses and two co-ed houses to
the Row, most individuals,
whether they feel positive, neutral
or negative toward the Row, will
content that the Row today has
been affected by the increasing
diversity of residence choices that
the student has to choose from.
"With the advent of co-ed
housing," said one house
president, "the feeling that the
Row is the place to live has been
dissipated tremendously."

What Happened...?
.The sparest definition of "the Row"
is "a geographic area of the Stanford
campus including the roads of Lasuen
Street and Mayfield .Avenue where the
fraternity and old sorority houses sit."
But in a broader context, "the Row"
designates more than a geographic area.
While several of the fraternity houses
have been torn down and rebuilt in
other areas of the campus, and while all
the sororities were converted during
World War II into university-run, female
housing, there still exists on the Row a
flavor of the atmosphere of by-gone
days at Stanford.
Most of the houses are showing signs
of age. There are attractive,
old-fashioned lainp-posts lining part of
the Row, and along much of the street
stand tall, leafy trees that drop large
quantities of leaves onto the pavement
in the fall.
Cenler of Controversy
Viewing this peaceful setting, it is
hard to imagine that the Row could
have ever been a center of controversy
on the campus, but during World War II
the Row was just that—a center of
controversy.
Past copies of The Stanford Daily
indicate that the pressure to get rid of
the sororities at Stanford mounted
steadily during the 1930's and climaxed
in the early 1940's when a group of
Roble sponsors organised a number of

students in an effort to have the
sororities turn their charters in to the
national chapters.
The Roble sponsors further urged
that "the university take over the
houses now occupied by sororities and
assume any obligations there entailed."
The inter-sorority council at Stanford
responded by setting up a committee to
study the sponsors' recommendations.
This committee came to the
conclusion that the sorority system at
Stanford would either have to be
expanded so that more girls could join
the houses, or it would have to be done
away with completely. Discontent with
the system as it stood came primarily
from the fact that only one out of every
three girls at Stanford was allowed to
join a sorority while many more than
that number wished to join.
The plan to do away with the
sorority system completely was
eventually adopted by the committee
and implemented by the university, so
that the Stanford sorority system met
with its demise before the close of
World War 11.
According to past Daily copies and
to one other reliable source, an
administrator who was involved with
the residence system at that time, the
rumors are not true that a girl threw
herself off Hoover Tower or hung
herself in front of a sororitv that did


ONCE A SORORITY, this house is now a part of the Row
not pledge her. A possible source
of these rumors is the fact that a
girl did drown in Lake Lagunita
soon after she was not pledged by
a sorority. It was never clear if the
drowning had been an accident or
an intentional act, however.
Row's Future
In the long-range plans of the
university, much of the Row will
be torn down as the new law
annex is constructed near
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and as
Campus Drive is eventually
widened into a four lane highway.
While the plans are not in a
finalized form, Storey and
Lathrop Houses, the two Row
houses closest to Dinkelspiel and
the center of quad, will probably
be the first houses to be torn
down in the near future. Even
these houses, though, are not
slated to be torn down before
1975 or so.
Given the fact that university
policy today is not presently
oriented toward saving the Row
houses at any cost to the
university, it is interesting to
examine the Row as it stands
today.
Students who don't live in the
university-run houses on the Row,
of which there are five all-female,
two co-ed and two £11-male
houses, often express stereotypic
observations about wha'- life is
like on the Row. The stereotypes
usually charge that the
university-run part of Row is a
bastion of conservatism where
intellectual, politically-conscious
concerns do not thrive.
The "Row dollie" has been
described —particularly in the
past—as about five feet, four
inches tall. She is either a
cheerleader or she is on Ax
Comm, and her goal in life is to
date fraternity boys.
This stereotype of an

and each house's character may

viewpoint that it is very difficult,
if not impossible, to generalize

"You can't talk about the
Row," Miss Mahoney said. "The

The Associate Dean of
Students also reiterated a belief of
Miss Mack's that the "Stanford

Mahoney doubted if there were
many Stanford dollies left on the
campus. "There isn't much status
left in being a dollie," she
observed.
Many of the house presidents
and resident assistants interviewed
defended the alleged diversity of
Row housing also. The stereotype

criticized repeatedly.

a non-Row house after living in
one during the sophomore year.
On the basis of the data that
they accumulated, the study's
authors concluded that the first
gorup of female students showed
the smallest reduction in
authoritarianism scores, the

second group a larger reduction
and the third group showed the
largest reduction.
Though the validity of the
authoritarian personality
construct is questioned by many
social learning psychologists today
and though much time has elapsed
since the study was completed,
critics of the Row sometimes
quote the Siegel and Siegel study
in support of their argument that
the Row is somehow different
than other areas of the campus
community.
Some of the students
interviewed who were the most
caustic in their observations about
the Row discounted the
applicability of the Siegel and
Siegel study to Row life today.
With the entrance of two all-male
houses and two co-ed houses to
the Row, most individuals,
whether they feel positive, neutral
or negative toward the Row, will
content that the Row today has
been affected by the increasing
diversity of residence choices that
the student has to choose from.
"With the advent of co-ed
housing," said one house
president, "the feeling that the
Row is the place to live has been
dissipated tremendously."

What Happened...?
.The sparest definition of "the Row"
is "a geographic area of the Stanford
campus including the roads of Lasuen
Street and Mayfield .Avenue where the
fraternity and old sorority houses sit."
But in a broader context, "the Row"
designates more than a geographic area.
While several of the fraternity houses
have been torn down and rebuilt in
other areas of the campus, and while all
the sororities were converted during
World War II into university-run, female
housing, there still exists on the Row a
flavor of the atmosphere of by-gone
days at Stanford.
Most of the houses are showing signs
of age. There are attractive,
old-fashioned lainp-posts lining part of
the Row, and along much of the street
stand tall, leafy trees that drop large
quantities of leaves onto the pavement
in the fall.
Cenler of Controversy
Viewing this peaceful setting, it is
hard to imagine that the Row could
have ever been a center of controversy
on the campus, but during World War II
the Row was just that—a center of
controversy.
Past copies of The Stanford Daily
indicate that the pressure to get rid of
the sororities at Stanford mounted
steadily during the 1930's and climaxed
in the early 1940's when a group of
Roble sponsors organised a number of

students in an effort to have the
sororities turn their charters in to the
national chapters.
The Roble sponsors further urged
that "the university take over the
houses now occupied by sororities and
assume any obligations there entailed."
The inter-sorority council at Stanford
responded by setting up a committee to
study the sponsors' recommendations.
This committee came to the
conclusion that the sorority system at
Stanford would either have to be
expanded so that more girls could join
the houses, or it would have to be done
away with completely. Discontent with
the system as it stood came primarily
from the fact that only one out of every
three girls at Stanford was allowed to
join a sorority while many more than
that number wished to join.
The plan to do away with the
sorority system completely was
eventually adopted by the committee
and implemented by the university, so
that the Stanford sorority system met
with its demise before the close of
World War 11.
According to past Daily copies and
to one other reliable source, an
administrator who was involved with
the residence system at that time, the
rumors are not true that a girl threw
herself off Hoover Tower or hung
herself in front of a sororitv that did


ONCE A SORORITY, this house is now a part of the Row
not pledge her. A possible source
of these rumors is the fact that a
girl did drown in Lake Lagunita
soon after she was not pledged by
a sorority. It was never clear if the
drowning had been an accident or
an intentional act, however.
Row's Future
In the long-range plans of the
university, much of the Row will
be torn down as the new law
annex is constructed near
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and as
Campus Drive is eventually
widened into a four lane highway.
While the plans are not in a
finalized form, Storey and
Lathrop Houses, the two Row
houses closest to Dinkelspiel and
the center of quad, will probably
be the first houses to be torn
down in the near future. Even
these houses, though, are not
slated to be torn down before
1975 or so.
Given the fact that university
policy today is not presently
oriented toward saving the Row
houses at any cost to the
university, it is interesting to
examine the Row as it stands
today.
Students who don't live in the
university-run houses on the Row,
of which there are five all-female,
two co-ed and two £11-male
houses, often express stereotypic
observations about wha'- life is
like on the Row. The stereotypes
usually charge that the
university-run part of Row is a
bastion of conservatism where
intellectual, politically-conscious
concerns do not thrive.
The "Row dollie" has been
described —particularly in the
past—as about five feet, four
inches tall. She is either a
cheerleader or she is on Ax
Comm, and her goal in life is to
date fraternity boys.
This stereotype of an
anti-intellectual Row inhabited by
fair-haired morons is violently
criticized by many individuals
who live in the university-run
housing on the Row and by

persons in the administration
whose task it is to operate the
financial, structural aspect of the
Row.
Diversity Stressed
The statement made again and
again by these people is that it is
impossible to generalize about the
kind of people who live on the
Row today. Particularly since
Grove House, the co-ed dorm that
Professor Mark Mancall set into
operation three years ago, moved
into two Row houses this last fall,
it is felt that "new blood" has
come to the Row. The fact that
Durand House, formerly an
all-female house, and Mayfield,
formerly the ATO Fraternity's
house, are both all-male this year
is another piece of evidence used
to support the belief on the part
of many individuals that the
Row's character is changing.
Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Row for the last two years,
maintains that all the
university-run houses on the Row
are very different. While she
recognizes that Storey and
Lathrop Houses may have more
problems with raids by fraternity
men, Miss Mack feels that each
house has its individual character,
and each house's character may
even evolve from quarter to
quarter as the population of a
house changes.
Sally Mahoney, Associate Dean
of Students in charge of student
housing, agrees with Miss Mack's

viewpoint that it is very difficult,
if not impossible, to generalize
about girls who live on the Row.
"You can't talk about the
Row," Miss Mahoney said. "The
houses are very diverse."
The Associate Dean of
Students also reiterated a belief of
Miss Mack's that the "Stanford
dollie" can be found in dorms all
over the campus. But Miss
Mahoney doubted if there were
many Stanford dollies left on the
campus. "There isn't much status
left in being a dollie," she
observed.
Many of the house presidents
and resident assistants interviewed
defended the alleged diversity of
Row housing also. The stereotype
of the Row as anti-intellectual was
criticized repeatedly.
The increasing number of
seminars in the university-run
Row houses was mentioned by
several students and
administrators as an indicator that
intellectual activity is increasing
on the Row. One house president
commented that intellectual and
political consciousness is on the
increase all over the campus, and
the Row is simply playing its part
in that increase.
Has Row Evolved?
Speaking to the question of the
alledged evolution in the Row's
character over the years toward a
less conservative residence area of
the campus, many Row residents
stated that they felt that criticism
of a conservative, anti-intellectual
Row was more warranted in past
years than it is today.
One psychological study of
Siegel and Siegel, published in

1957, obtained results that did
not present a very favorable
portrayal of girls living on the
Row at tha time. The study
observed that "the Row and
non-Row social groups differ in
attitude norms, with Row
residents being generally more
authoritarian than non-Row
residents."
The study's conclusion was
formulated after three groups of
Stanford females were tested:
women who had gained
assignment to live on the Row
during their sophomore year and
who did not attempt to draw out
of the Row at the end of that
year; women who had not gained
assignment to a Row house for
sophomore year and who drew for
a Row house again after living in a
non-Row house during the
sophomore year; and women who
had not gained assignment to a
Row house for the sophomore
year, and who chose to remain in
a non-Row house after living in
one during the sophomore year.
On the basis of the data that
they accumulated, the study's
authors concluded that the first
gorup of female students showed
the smallest reduction in
authoritarianism scores, the

second group a larger reduction
and the third group showed the
largest reduction.
Though the validity of the
authoritarian personality
construct is questioned by many
social learning psychologists today
and though much time has elapsed

critics of the Row sometimes
quote the Siegel and Siegel study
in support of their argument that
the Row is somehow different

soon after she was not pledged by
a sorority. It was never clear if the
drowning had been an accident or
an intentional act, however.
Row's Future
In the long-range plans of the
university, much of the Row will
be torn down as the new law
annex is constructed near
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and as
Campus Drive is eventually
widened into a four lane highway.
While the plans are not in a
finalized form, Storey and
Lathrop Houses, the two Row
houses closest to Dinkelspiel and
the center of quad, will probably
be the first houses to be torn
down in the near future. Even
these houses, though, are not
slated to be torn down before
1975 or so.
Given the fact that university
policy today is not presently
oriented toward saving the Row
houses at any cost to the
university, it is interesting to
examine the Row as it stands
today.
Students who don't live in the
university-run houses on the Row,
of which there are five all-female,
two co-ed and two £11-male
houses, often express stereotypic
observations about wha'- life is
like on the Row. The stereotypes
usually charge that the
university-run part of Row is a
bastion of conservatism where
intellectual, politically-conscious
concerns do not thrive.
The "Row dollie" has been
described —particularly in the
past—as about five feet, four
inches tall. She is either a
cheerleader or she is on Ax
Comm, and her goal in life is to
date fraternity boys.
This stereotype of an
anti-intellectual Row inhabited by
fair-haired morons is violently
criticized by many individuals
who live in the university-run
housing on the Row and by

persons in the administration
whose task it is to operate the
financial, structural aspect of the
Row.
Diversity Stressed
The statement made again and
again by these people is that it is
impossible to generalize about the
kind of people who live on the
Row today. Particularly since
Grove House, the co-ed dorm that
Professor Mark Mancall set into
operation three years ago, moved
into two Row houses this last fall,
it is felt that "new blood" has
come to the Row. The fact that
Durand House, formerly an
all-female house, and Mayfield,
formerly the ATO Fraternity's
house, are both all-male this year
is another piece of evidence used
to support the belief on the part
of many individuals that the
Row's character is changing.
Cora Lee Mack, Director of the
Row for the last two years,
maintains that all the
university-run houses on the Row
are very different. While she
recognizes that Storey and
Lathrop Houses may have more
problems with raids by fraternity
men, Miss Mack feels that each
house has its individual character,
and each house's character may
even evolve from quarter to
quarter as the population of a
house changes.
Sally Mahoney, Associate Dean
of Students in charge of student
housing, agrees with Miss Mack's

viewpoint that it is very difficult,
if not impossible, to generalize
about girls who live on the Row.
"You can't talk about the
Row," Miss Mahoney said. "The
houses are very diverse."
The Associate Dean of
Students also reiterated a belief of
Miss Mack's that the "Stanford
dollie" can be found in dorms all
over the campus. But Miss
Mahoney doubted if there were
many Stanford dollies left on the
campus. "There isn't much status
left in being a dollie," she
observed.
Many of the house presidents
and resident assistants interviewed
defended the alleged diversity of
Row housing also. The stereotype
of the Row as anti-intellectual was
criticized repeatedly.
The increasing number of
seminars in the university-run
Row houses was mentioned by
several students and
administrators as an indicator that
intellectual activity is increasing
on the Row. One house president
commented that intellectual and
political consciousness is on the
increase all over the campus, and
the Row is simply playing its part
in that increase.
Has Row Evolved?
Speaking to the question of the
alledged evolution in the Row's
character over the years toward a
less conservative residence area of
the campus, many Row residents
stated that they felt that criticism
of a conservative, anti-intellectual
Row was more warranted in past
years than it is today.
One psychological study of
Siegel and Siegel, published in

1957, obtained results that did
not present a very favorable
portrayal of girls living on the
Row at tha time. The study
observed that "the Row and
non-Row social groups differ in
attitude norms, with Row
residents being generally more
authoritarian than non-Row
residents."
The study's conclusion was
formulated after three groups of
Stanford females were tested:
women who had gained
assignment to live on the Row
during their sophomore year and
who did not attempt to draw out
of the Row at the end of that
year; women who had not gained
assignment to a Row house for
sophomore year and who drew for
a Row house again after living in a
non-Row house during the
sophomore year; and women who
had not gained assignment to a
Row house for the sophomore
year, and who chose to remain in
a non-Row house after living in
one during the sophomore year.
On the basis of the data that
they accumulated, the study's
authors concluded that the first
gorup of female students showed
the smallest reduction in
authoritarianism scores, the

second group a larger reduction
and the third group showed the
largest reduction.
Though the validity of the
authoritarian personality
construct is questioned by many
social learning psychologists today
and though much time has elapsed
since the study was completed,
critics of the Row sometimes
quote the Siegel and Siegel study
in support of their argument that
the Row is somehow different
than other areas of the campus
community.
Some of the students
interviewed who were the most
caustic in their observations about
the Row discounted the
applicability of the Siegel and
Siegel study to Row life today.
With the entrance of two all-male
houses and two co-ed houses to
the Row, most individuals,
whether they feel positive, neutral
or negative toward the Row, will
content that the Row today has
been affected by the increasing
diversity of residence choices that
the student has to choose from.
"With the advent of co-ed
housing," said one house
president, "the feeling that the
Row is the place to live has been
dissipated tremendously."

What Happened...?
.The sparest definition of "the Row"
is "a geographic area of the Stanford
campus including the roads of Lasuen
Street and Mayfield .Avenue where the
fraternity and old sorority houses sit."
But in a broader context, "the Row"
designates more than a geographic area.
While several of the fraternity houses
have been torn down and rebuilt in
other areas of the campus, and while all
the sororities were converted during
World War II into university-run, female
housing, there still exists on the Row a
flavor of the atmosphere of by-gone
days at Stanford.
Most of the houses are showing signs
of age. There are attractive,
old-fashioned lainp-posts lining part of
the Row, and along much of the street
stand tall, leafy trees that drop large
quantities of leaves onto the pavement
in the fall.
Cenler of Controversy
Viewing this peaceful setting, it is
hard to imagine that the Row could
have ever been a center of controversy
on the campus, but during World War II
the Row was just that—a center of
controversy.
Past copies of The Stanford Daily
indicate that the pressure to get rid of
the sororities at Stanford mounted
steadily during the 1930's and climaxed
in the early 1940's when a group of
Roble sponsors organised a number of

students in an effort to have the
sororities turn their charters in to the
national chapters.
The Roble sponsors further urged
that "the university take over the
houses now occupied by sororities and
assume any obligations there entailed."
The inter-sorority council at Stanford
responded by setting up a committee to
study the sponsors' recommendations.
This committee came to the
conclusion that the sorority system at
Stanford would either have to be
expanded so that more girls could join
the houses, or it would have to be done
away with completely. Discontent with
the system as it stood came primarily
from the fact that only one out of every
three girls at Stanford was allowed to
join a sorority while many more than
that number wished to join.
The plan to do away with the
sorority system completely was
eventually adopted by the committee
and implemented by the university, so
that the Stanford sorority system met
with its demise before the close of
World War 11.
According to past Daily copies and
to one other reliable source, an
administrator who was involved with
the residence system at that time, the
rumors are not true that a girl threw
herself off Hoover Tower or hung
herself in front of a sororitv that did


ONCE A SORORITY, this house is now a part of the Row
not pledge her. A possible source
of these rumors is the fact that a
girl did drown in Lake Lagunita
soon after she was not pledged by
a sorority. It was never clear if the
drowning had been an accident or
an intentional act, however.
Row's Future
In the long-range plans of the
university, much of the Row will
be torn down as the new law
annex is constructed near
Dinkelspiel Auditorium and as
Campus Drive is eventually
widened into a four lane highway.
While the plans are not in a

increase all over the campus, and
the Row is simply playing its part
in that increase.
Has Row Evolved?
Speaking to the question of the
alledged evolution in the Row's
character over the years toward a
less conservative residence area of
the campus, many Row residents
stated that they felt that criticism
of a conservative, anti-intellectual
Row was more warranted in past
years than it is today.
One psychological study of
Siegel and Siegel, published in

1957, obtained results that did
not present a very favorable
portrayal of girls living on the
Row at tha time. The study
observed that "the Row and
non-Row social groups differ in
attitude norms, with Row
residents being generally more
authoritarian than non-Row
residents."
The study's conclusion was
formulated after three groups of
Stanford females were tested:
women who had gained
assignment to live on the Row
during their sophomore year and
who did not attempt to draw out
of the Row at the end of that
year; women who had not gained
assignment to a Row house for
sophomore year and who drew for
a Row house again after living in a
non-Row house during the
sophomore year; and women who
had not gained assignment to a
Row house for the sophomore
year, and who chose to remain in
a non-Row house after living in
one during the sophomore year.
On the basis of the data that
they accumulated, the study's
authors concluded that the first
gorup of female students showed
the smallest reduction in
authoritarianism scores, the

second group a larger reduction
and the third group showed the
largest reduction.
Though the validity of the
authoritarian personality
construct is questioned by many
social learning psychologists today
and though much time has elapsed
since the study was completed,
critics of the Row sometimes
quote the Siegel and Siegel study
in support of their argument that
the Row is somehow different
than other areas of the campus
community.
Some of the students
interviewed who were the most
caustic in their observations about
the Row discounted the
applicability of the Siegel and
Siegel study to Row life today.
With the entrance of two all-male
houses and two co-ed houses to
the Row, most individuals,
whether they feel positive, neutral
or negative toward the Row, will
content that the Row today has
been affected by the increasing
diversity of residence choices that
the student has to choose from.
"With the advent of co-ed
housing," said one house
president, "the feeling that the
Row is the place to live has been
dissipated tremendously."

What Happened...?
