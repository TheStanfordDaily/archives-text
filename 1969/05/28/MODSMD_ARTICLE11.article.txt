# Stranglehold?
## 
### 
I The myth that "private" universities in
CII 6 United States are "private" has been
dwindling for some time, but the McClellan
Committee's issuance of a subpoena to
Stanford yesterday abruptly ended the
liable.
{ Kenneth S. Pitzer has been ordered to
appear before the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigation with all
SJniversity records on 90 individuals and a
cwren organizations next Tuesday. The
government, already exercising controls
(jver non-public institutions of higher
learning through federal grants and
contracts has tightened its grip even
further.
. 'Stanford's purpose now must be to
prevent that grip from becoming a
stranglehold.
! The immediate purpose of the
(Congressional committee is to ascertain
whether college administrators are
cjo«aplying with federal laws which order
tlit«n to deny government funds to
students who disrupt the functioning of the
University.
j The common result in the wake of
campus dissent has been an outcry against
cpercive tactics by the protestors. This
sti!9poena demonstrates that coercion can
cdMc not only from the radicals, but the
Establishment as well-and is even more
f"ightening when wielded from a seat of
power. It shows that when people at
Universities fail to conform to the
cp^imionly accepted limits of dissent and

act in a way which is deemed a direct
challenge to the system, they will be
repressed. Faculty and students are limited
in what they may do or say.
We would like to urge President Pitzer
to ignore this tentacle of the bureaucratic
octopus, refuse to appear before the
Committee, and not supply the
information demanded, but we realize it is
almost impossible for him to choose such a
path.
We would like to ask him to join with
the presidents of other universities who
nave received such subpoenas and form a
strong front against this rebirth of
McCarthyism, but we realize that such an
effort is almost surely doomed to failure:
the power lies with the money.
President Pitzer probably sees himself in
no position to take such steps. Under the
guidance of Frederick Terman and Wallace
Sterling, Stanford moved to the front ranks
of higher education on the impetus of
federal funding. Take tiiis money away,
and Stanford as we know it would cease to
exist.
Clark Kerr wrote in The Uses of the
University about the direction in which he
saw American society and American higher
education evolving, lie heralded the new
system with its nationalized knowledge
industry as both a "new slavery" and a
"new freedom." But it appears the
university is free only to be the slave of the
system.

power. It shows that when people at
Universities fail to conform to the
cp^imionly accepted limits of dissent and

act in a way which is deemed a direct
challenge to the system, they will be
repressed. Faculty and students are limited
in what they may do or say.
We would like to urge President Pitzer
to ignore this tentacle of the bureaucratic
octopus, refuse to appear before the
Committee, and not supply the
information demanded, but we realize it is
almost impossible for him to choose such a
path.
We would like to ask him to join with
the presidents of other universities who
nave received such subpoenas and form a
strong front against this rebirth of
McCarthyism, but we realize that such an
effort is almost surely doomed to failure:
the power lies with the money.
President Pitzer probably sees himself in
no position to take such steps. Under the
guidance of Frederick Terman and Wallace
Sterling, Stanford moved to the front ranks
of higher education on the impetus of
federal funding. Take tiiis money away,
and Stanford as we know it would cease to
exist.
Clark Kerr wrote in The Uses of the
University about the direction in which he
saw American society and American higher
education evolving, lie heralded the new
system with its nationalized knowledge
industry as both a "new slavery" and a
"new freedom." But it appears the
university is free only to be the slave of the
system.
I The myth that "private" universities in
CII 6 United States are "private" has been
dwindling for some time, but the McClellan
Committee's issuance of a subpoena to
Stanford yesterday abruptly ended the
liable.
{ Kenneth S. Pitzer has been ordered to
appear before the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigation with all
SJniversity records on 90 individuals and a
cwren organizations next Tuesday. The
government, already exercising controls
(jver non-public institutions of higher
learning through federal grants and
contracts has tightened its grip even
further.
. 'Stanford's purpose now must be to
prevent that grip from becoming a
stranglehold.
! The immediate purpose of the
(Congressional committee is to ascertain
whether college administrators are
cjo«aplying with federal laws which order
tlit«n to deny government funds to
students who disrupt the functioning of the
University.
j The common result in the wake of
campus dissent has been an outcry against
cpercive tactics by the protestors. This
sti!9poena demonstrates that coercion can
cdMc not only from the radicals, but the
Establishment as well-and is even more
f"ightening when wielded from a seat of
power. It shows that when people at
