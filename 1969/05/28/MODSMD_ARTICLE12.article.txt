## Sixth Commandment Debate 
### 
editor, THE DAILY:
In a letter in last Friday's Daily
(May 23), Mabel Rockwell tried
lofoint out that for thousands of
years the world's major religions
nave emphasized the idea "Thou
ahalt not kill." Mrs. Rockwell
repeated again and again the
argument that the Sixth
(pommandment does not allow a
person to kill another who is in
filiform, does not allow a person
!o use naval guns in warfare: she
learly makes the point that the
Sixth Commandment is "Thou
fialt not kill."
,F j. r ever, one should keep in
tkiina that the question of war is
tkql a simple one.
i It should be pointed out that
she Sixth Commandment (in
Hebrew 10 tirtzach) does not
tjiean "Thou shalt not kill," but
ijather "Don't murder." If it were
a prohibition against killing of any

kind, it would directly contradict
many of the laws of Moses which
prescribe capital punishment for
certain crimes.
Those questions of what wars
are just and what acts of war are
acceptable are not simple, and
they are dealth with at greater
length elsewhere in the Torah,
particularly Deuteronomy 20
(which deals with questions of
deferments and defoliation in a
remarkably humane way).
Although we sympathize with
Mrs. Rockwell's desire to find a
straight-forward prescription from
Cod on how to deal with the
questions of war, moral issues of
this magnitude require deep
thoughts and searching, and we
sincerely believe that to interpret
the Sixth Commandment to
include "Don't take part in any
war" is a sad mistake. We must
resist the temptation to use

simplistic approaches to complex
moral questions.

Congratulations to Danton B.
Spivey and any others who still
have the wit to be shocked.
'Tolerance' has been for too
long the supreme virtue, and the
time for intolerance of the new

Editor, THE DAILY:
Having read the current
Daily-Sweeney blast against SRI, I
am convinced that if this were a
few thousand years ago, the Daily
would be equally outraged against
the research that invented the
wheel, because it too had military
implications.

• L i Policy Board
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a letter to the Daily, a Mr.
Kuester is supposedly echoing a
disapproval by some members of
the lA, of a recent statement of
the IA in supporting the student
struggle against SRI.
I have to observe some things:
1) Mr. Kuester claimed in
personal conversation to be for
the statement. So he just appears
to be a benevolent person putting

his brave pen in the front line for
some (?) members that have a
different opinion than his own.
2) The Policy Board was given
the power from the majority of
the members of the IA that voted
on a referendum to make
statements.
3) The Policy Board is the
only responsible body to present
the opinion of the IA members. If
the majority of the members
disagree with the Policy Board
there is a procedure for ending the
present Policy Board.
4) Whom has Mr. Kuester
polled? It is easily understood
that his friends may be against the
statment but how many friends
does he have?
5) Who arc the "concerned
members"?
6) Some other "concerned
members" that I know are
disillusioned that all the IA does is
come up with statements and
nothing more. What about them,
Mr. Kuester?
7) If there is a feasible way of
knowing exactly the general
feelings of the members before a
vote is taken I, personally, would
be all for it. Since there isn't we
have to depend on the Policy
Board's perception of the feeling.
After all, the Policy Board is
supposed to represent it.
8) Anyway the whole matter
appears rather trivial and I do not
intend to come back to it.

• L i Policy Board
Editor, THE DAILY:
In a letter to the Daily, a Mr.
Kuester is supposedly echoing a
disapproval by some members of
the lA, of a recent statement of
the IA in supporting the student
struggle against SRI.
I have to observe some things:
1) Mr. Kuester claimed in
personal conversation to be for
the statement. So he just appears
to be a benevolent person putting

his brave pen in the front line for
some (?) members that have a
different opinion than his own.
2) The Policy Board was given
the power from the majority of
the members of the IA that voted
on a referendum to make
statements.
3) The Policy Board is the
only responsible body to present
the opinion of the IA members. If
the majority of the members
disagree with the Policy Board
there is a procedure for ending the
present Policy Board.
4) Whom has Mr. Kuester
polled? It is easily understood
that his friends may be against the
statment but how many friends
does he have?
5) Who arc the "concerned
members"?
6) Some other "concerned
members" that I know are
disillusioned that all the IA does is
come up with statements and
nothing more. What about them,
Mr. Kuester?
7) If there is a feasible way of
knowing exactly the general
feelings of the members before a
vote is taken I, personally, would
be all for it. Since there isn't we
have to depend on the Policy
Board's perception of the feeling.
After all, the Policy Board is
supposed to represent it.
8) Anyway the whole matter
appears rather trivial and I do not
intend to come back to it.

In a letter in last Friday's Daily
(May 23), Mabel Rockwell tried
lofoint out that for thousands of
years the world's major religions
nave emphasized the idea "Thou
ahalt not kill." Mrs. Rockwell
repeated again and again the
argument that the Sixth
(pommandment does not allow a
person to kill another who is in
filiform, does not allow a person
!o use naval guns in warfare: she
learly makes the point that the
Sixth Commandment is "Thou
fialt not kill."
,F j. r ever, one should keep in
tkiina that the question of war is
tkql a simple one.
i It should be pointed out that
she Sixth Commandment (in
Hebrew 10 tirtzach) does not
tjiean "Thou shalt not kill," but
ijather "Don't murder." If it were
a prohibition against killing of any

kind, it would directly contradict
many of the laws of Moses which
prescribe capital punishment for
certain crimes.
Those questions of what wars
are just and what acts of war are
acceptable are not simple, and
they are dealth with at greater
length elsewhere in the Torah,
particularly Deuteronomy 20
(which deals with questions of
deferments and defoliation in a
remarkably humane way).
Although we sympathize with
Mrs. Rockwell's desire to find a
straight-forward prescription from
Cod on how to deal with the
questions of war, moral issues of
this magnitude require deep
thoughts and searching, and we
sincerely believe that to interpret
the Sixth Commandment to
include "Don't take part in any
war" is a sad mistake. We must
resist the temptation to use

simplistic approaches to complex
moral questions.
