# Guest Column
## Pacifist Has Fears About A3M 
### Jeff Weil 
I haven't solved it. But what I
would like this column and
subsequent ones to be is a kind of
wondering out loud that will help
the Movement by questioning it. I
do not intend it to hinder the
Movement. More specifically, if it
slows the drive on the SRI
research, it will have defeated its
purposes.
But to the problem: I find it
difficult to be a pacifist. One of
the greatest contradictions to this
position is the success of the
Cuban Revolution. One can
answer the old hypothetical
questions (e.g., "If you had a
choice between killing and being
killed, would you sacrifice your
own life?") affirmatively and still
reject pacifism. The new question
in light of Cuba is "If you are
living under an oppressive
government, and you know that
the only way you can end the
misery of most of its people is by
picking up a rifle, would you do
it?"
Before the Cuban Revolution,
80% of the people were living on
starvation wages, hospitals were
scarce and only those who could
afford a doctor got one, illiteracy
was the rule, and racism even kept
Batista off the beach of the
Havana Biltmore because he had
black blood. Today everyone eats,
though none eat excessively well,
medical care is free and more
widely available, the literacy
campaign of 1961 has made Cuba
nearly completely literate,
education is universal, and racism
(at least institutional racism) has
been eliminated. Even the
subjective needs of the people
have been filled by making
entertainment and art available to
the masses and by constructing
the idea of the "New Man of the
Twentieth Century." This
development was initiated
through the use of violence.
Revolution against an
oppressive regime is just. It is not
really a question of violence of
nonviolence. Because of the high
infant mortality rates in Latin
America, for instance, by not
taking the (usually) necessarily
violent action, one is perpetuating
the violence of the status quo.
Grisly
I realize that revolutions are
grisly affairs. Sometimes the
Vietcong mutiliate a GI prisoner
and leave him in the path of
oncoming U.S. troops. The way I

had this explained to me was that
the Vietcong cannot possibly
defeat the U.S. army by military
might. It is a psychological war,
and when the troops see their
buddy lying mangled in the road,
it tears hell out of their morale,
thus contributing to an NLF
victory. But—but it is absolutely
necessary that the NLF win for
the good of the Vietnamese.
It should also be noted that the
guerrilla battles in Guatemala and
Vietnam were not begun until the
nonviolent methods proved
ineffective. Father Melville, a
. Maryknoll priest who helped the
Guatemalan guerrillas, tells how
he tried co-operative farming
systems and banking and
recruiting university students to
work with the campesinos before
he was convinced that guerrilla
action would be the only effective
means of social change. Nguyen
Tho, leader of the NLF, was jailed
in Saigon for his activities as a
lawyer attempting to legally
reunite Vietnam (by
implementing the Geneva
Accords) before he started the
guerrilla movement.
It could be extrapolated from
this that if revolution is a right of
the oppressed in the Third World
(an; in the ghetto), it is the
imperative of their brothers who
live in the country which is the
direct and real cause of their
oppression. No action against its
government would be too
extreme. However, let us treat the
problem of revolution in America
in a separate column.
Values Lost
The Movement has become
increasingly violent. In the
transition from flower- to
brick-throwing, a lot of human
values have been lost. I am
disturbed by this. Moreover, a
new bullshit ideology has evolved
to substantiate the new tactics.
Like the line of many SDS
people that nonviolence is a
middle-class hangup. Crap. The
middle-class eats up Bonnie and
Clyde and sends the police to
shoot the looters when it might
have a television taken from its
shop windows. The middle class is
much more hung up with violence
against property than with
violence against people. Moreover,
the poor still use nonviolence in
some cases.
A girl in a dormitory discussion
group was voicing her
apprehensions of taking a life or
using violent methods. So some
SDSer very analytically (not to
say patronizingly) said, "Let's
look into your background to find
what has given you this hangup
with violence." Well, screw you!
Let's look into your background
to see where your hangup with
burning babies or rat-bitten
children originated.
I am more afraid of the
ex-pacifists eager to try out their
new toys than of those who never
pacifists. And I am sick of hearing
of encounter groups where they
plan shoot-the-trustees.
Fair Play
The new word that we are
outside the system, outlaws,
makes anything fair play. When
you couple this with a bastardized
version of the socialist ideal, you
get people saying, "Well, it's only
property." when a Columbia
professor's research is burned. The
research was on some aspect of
the Middle Ages, not CBW. (Mark
Rudd denies that the students
burned the research, but whether
or not this is true, this attitude

persists.) I do distinguish between
violence against property (e.g.,
Art Melville's recent raid on Dow
Chemicals) and violence against
people. But there are cases like
the research example where
violence again property is very
damaging violence against people.
Then in order to further
accomodate the new type of
tactic, you have some radical
making statements like "Violence
is liberating, read Fanon." Well,
shit, I've read Fanon, too. In his
case studies at the end of The
Wretched of the Earth, he writes
about an Algerian rebel afflicted
with "insomnia accompanied by
anxiety and suicidal obsessions."
His condition was directly
traceable to the time when ten
people were killed by a bomb he
had planted. That is not being
liberated.
However, I do concede that
there are other cases where the
slave kills his slave personality
with violence and is freed. But I
am not that kind of slave. Here I
disagree with Tom Hayden and
others. White radical students are
not oppressed. White radicals do
not see their sisters starve to death
at age two, do not have their
mothers raped by the soldiers of
an occupation army, and do not
cut sugar cane seven days a week
for eighty cents a day. Different
means should be used to solve the
problems (e.g., educational gripes,
Radical Studies) of white radical
students. This assertion does not
preclude the use (when necessary)
of more extreme tactics to stop
imperialism and racism.
Lost Love
The graffiti on the
construction site wall: "SDS: All
you need is love." The Movement
has lost too much of its love. And
attitude is of immense
importance. We have set for
ourselves the gargantuan task of
building a human society (An;
don't start that stuff about the
rebel being driven to revolt and
not having to have a blueprint for
the new society? we are going to
build a good society.), and we will
fail to do it if we are inhuman
people. One SDS member said,
"We'll have to become inhuman
so our children will be able to be
human." No. It won't work out
that way.
One example of the
dehumanization within the
Movement is that whether or not
we care about the stealing of
Encina secretary's typewriter or
of the two non-war-related theses
at AEL, it is for purely political
reasons. We don't let the humane
researchers back into AEL at the
beginning because it puts us in a
good bargaining position, and we
finally do let them back in
because the action makes us look
good and gains community
support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.
Staughton Lynd had a column
in the Guardian, a radical weekly,
this summer called The Good
Society. In one issue he said that
police should not be called pigs.
They are only the tools of
repression, and are, moreover,
members of the proletariat. He
quoted from Cleaver's Soul on
Ice: "The price of hating other
human beings is loving oneself

less." Lynd's column was soon
discontinued in the Guardian.
Contradiction
Last fall I mentioned this to
one SDSer who said, "No, man,
you need hate. You need to have
people hate Johnson to mobilize
them." This implies a pretty low
view of man: he is an animal that
can show concern over social evils
only after he has been whipped
into a mouth-foaming rage. It is a
view in direct contradiction to
that of SDS's founding charter
which says, "We regard men as
infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for
reason, freedom, and love." Look,
1 don't liate Johnson, David
Rockefeller, or Pitzer. I just want
to get them off the backs of the
people of the Third World and the
ghetto. And pretty much any
way. But hate is a thing of the
little man. Nietzsche would call it
a product of a slave morality.
Before I revised this, I got into
a discussion of the uses of hate.
Every revolution I know of has
been preceded by an obvious
hatred fo; the ruiing elite. But
then every revolution I've looked
at has had the terrorized
aftermath that I'd like to avoid.
Hate, according to Coleman's
Community Conflict, is "part of
the process of stripping for
action." Coleman also says, "Men
have a strong need for
consistency. If I disagree violently
with someone, then it becomes
psychologically more comfortable
to see him as totally black than
grey."
Here we have to go into cost
accounting. Hate does help
mobilize. But it also can hurt
innocent people. And by seeing
the other side as totally evil, by
depersonalizing him, one loses
much of that faculty of sympathy
that is part of his own humanity.
He depersonalizes himself. I think
this is what Cleaver meant. Again,
inhuman people do not make
human societies. There are other
feelings we can use to mobilize.
Hate is not necessary for outrage.
Punishment
Which brings us to the
punishme: problem. Steve Smith
likes to teli the story about one of
Fidel Castro's speeches. Castro
was telling the crowd how many
believe that they should not stop
until the last counter
revolutionary's head is chopped
off. The crowd cheered. But, he
continued, the Cuban people have
a better way to do it. The
counterrevolutionaries will be
rehabilitated by forced labor. The
crowd yelled back, "No! Chop off
their heads! Chop of their heads!"
I don't think it is a funny
anecdote.
Punishment to make a man
"pay for his sins against the
people" is part of the slave
morality all over again. We've got
to get beyond this good-and-evil
jazz. Oppressors should be
prevented from continuing their
oppression. That's all.
I know we're in no position to
chop off all the ruling class heads
in this country right now, but we
are in a position to hurt people
needlessly.
I fear for the Movement. We
have a chance to end a lot of this
suffering and to create a good
society. And we could blow that
chance so easily.

support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.
Staughton Lynd had a column
in the Guardian, a radical weekly,
this summer called The Good
Society. In one issue he said that
police should not be called pigs.
They are only the tools of
repression, and are, moreover,
members of the proletariat. He
quoted from Cleaver's Soul on
Ice: "The price of hating other
human beings is loving oneself

less." Lynd's column was soon
discontinued in the Guardian.
Contradiction
Last fall I mentioned this to
one SDSer who said, "No, man,
you need hate. You need to have
people hate Johnson to mobilize
them." This implies a pretty low
view of man: he is an animal that
can show concern over social evils
only after he has been whipped
into a mouth-foaming rage. It is a
view in direct contradiction to
that of SDS's founding charter
which says, "We regard men as
infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for
reason, freedom, and love." Look,
1 don't liate Johnson, David
Rockefeller, or Pitzer. I just want
to get them off the backs of the
people of the Third World and the
ghetto. And pretty much any
way. But hate is a thing of the
little man. Nietzsche would call it
a product of a slave morality.
Before I revised this, I got into
a discussion of the uses of hate.
Every revolution I know of has
been preceded by an obvious
hatred fo; the ruiing elite. But
then every revolution I've looked
at has had the terrorized
aftermath that I'd like to avoid.
Hate, according to Coleman's
Community Conflict, is "part of
the process of stripping for
action." Coleman also says, "Men
have a strong need for
consistency. If I disagree violently
with someone, then it becomes
psychologically more comfortable
to see him as totally black than
grey."
Here we have to go into cost
accounting. Hate does help
mobilize. But it also can hurt
innocent people. And by seeing
the other side as totally evil, by
depersonalizing him, one loses
much of that faculty of sympathy
that is part of his own humanity.
He depersonalizes himself. I think
this is what Cleaver meant. Again,
inhuman people do not make
human societies. There are other
feelings we can use to mobilize.
Hate is not necessary for outrage.
Punishment
Which brings us to the
punishme: problem. Steve Smith
likes to teli the story about one of
Fidel Castro's speeches. Castro
was telling the crowd how many
believe that they should not stop
until the last counter
revolutionary's head is chopped
off. The crowd cheered. But, he
continued, the Cuban people have
a better way to do it. The
counterrevolutionaries will be
rehabilitated by forced labor. The
crowd yelled back, "No! Chop off
their heads! Chop of their heads!"
I don't think it is a funny
anecdote.
Punishment to make a man
"pay for his sins against the
people" is part of the slave
morality all over again. We've got
to get beyond this good-and-evil
jazz. Oppressors should be
prevented from continuing their
oppression. That's all.
I know we're in no position to
chop off all the ruling class heads
in this country right now, but we
are in a position to hurt people
needlessly.
I fear for the Movement. We
have a chance to end a lot of this
suffering and to create a good
society. And we could blow that
chance so easily.
(Jeff Weil is a sophomore in
physics- Ed.)
I haven't solved it. But what I
would like this column and
subsequent ones to be is a kind of
wondering out loud that will help
the Movement by questioning it. I
do not intend it to hinder the
Movement. More specifically, if it
slows the drive on the SRI
research, it will have defeated its
purposes.
But to the problem: I find it
difficult to be a pacifist. One of
the greatest contradictions to this
position is the success of the
Cuban Revolution. One can
answer the old hypothetical
questions (e.g., "If you had a
choice between killing and being
killed, would you sacrifice your
own life?") affirmatively and still
reject pacifism. The new question
in light of Cuba is "If you are
living under an oppressive
government, and you know that
the only way you can end the
misery of most of its people is by
picking up a rifle, would you do
it?"
Before the Cuban Revolution,
80% of the people were living on
starvation wages, hospitals were
scarce and only those who could
afford a doctor got one, illiteracy
was the rule, and racism even kept
Batista off the beach of the
Havana Biltmore because he had
black blood. Today everyone eats,
though none eat excessively well,
medical care is free and more
widely available, the literacy
campaign of 1961 has made Cuba
nearly completely literate,
education is universal, and racism
(at least institutional racism) has
been eliminated. Even the
subjective needs of the people
have been filled by making
entertainment and art available to
the masses and by constructing
the idea of the "New Man of the
Twentieth Century." This
development was initiated
through the use of violence.
Revolution against an
oppressive regime is just. It is not
really a question of violence of
nonviolence. Because of the high
infant mortality rates in Latin
America, for instance, by not
taking the (usually) necessarily
violent action, one is perpetuating
the violence of the status quo.
Grisly
I realize that revolutions are
grisly affairs. Sometimes the
Vietcong mutiliate a GI prisoner
and leave him in the path of
oncoming U.S. troops. The way I

had this explained to me was that
the Vietcong cannot possibly
defeat the U.S. army by military
might. It is a psychological war,
and when the troops see their
buddy lying mangled in the road,
it tears hell out of their morale,
thus contributing to an NLF
victory. But—but it is absolutely
necessary that the NLF win for
the good of the Vietnamese.
It should also be noted that the
guerrilla battles in Guatemala and
Vietnam were not begun until the
nonviolent methods proved
ineffective. Father Melville, a
. Maryknoll priest who helped the
Guatemalan guerrillas, tells how
he tried co-operative farming
systems and banking and
recruiting university students to
work with the campesinos before
he was convinced that guerrilla
action would be the only effective
means of social change. Nguyen
Tho, leader of the NLF, was jailed
in Saigon for his activities as a
lawyer attempting to legally
reunite Vietnam (by
implementing the Geneva
Accords) before he started the
guerrilla movement.
It could be extrapolated from
this that if revolution is a right of
the oppressed in the Third World
(an; in the ghetto), it is the
imperative of their brothers who
live in the country which is the
direct and real cause of their
oppression. No action against its
government would be too
extreme. However, let us treat the
problem of revolution in America
in a separate column.
Values Lost
The Movement has become
increasingly violent. In the
transition from flower- to
brick-throwing, a lot of human
values have been lost. I am
disturbed by this. Moreover, a
new bullshit ideology has evolved
to substantiate the new tactics.
Like the line of many SDS
people that nonviolence is a
middle-class hangup. Crap. The
middle-class eats up Bonnie and
Clyde and sends the police to
shoot the looters when it might
have a television taken from its
shop windows. The middle class is
much more hung up with violence
against property than with
violence against people. Moreover,
the poor still use nonviolence in
some cases.
A girl in a dormitory discussion
group was voicing her
apprehensions of taking a life or
using violent methods. So some
SDSer very analytically (not to
say patronizingly) said, "Let's
look into your background to find
what has given you this hangup
with violence." Well, screw you!
Let's look into your background
to see where your hangup with
burning babies or rat-bitten
children originated.
I am more afraid of the
ex-pacifists eager to try out their
new toys than of those who never
pacifists. And I am sick of hearing
of encounter groups where they
plan shoot-the-trustees.
Fair Play
The new word that we are
outside the system, outlaws,
makes anything fair play. When
you couple this with a bastardized
version of the socialist ideal, you
get people saying, "Well, it's only
property." when a Columbia
professor's research is burned. The
research was on some aspect of
the Middle Ages, not CBW. (Mark
Rudd denies that the students
burned the research, but whether
or not this is true, this attitude

persists.) I do distinguish between
violence against property (e.g.,
Art Melville's recent raid on Dow
Chemicals) and violence against
people. But there are cases like
the research example where
violence again property is very
damaging violence against people.
Then in order to further
accomodate the new type of
tactic, you have some radical
making statements like "Violence
is liberating, read Fanon." Well,
shit, I've read Fanon, too. In his
case studies at the end of The
Wretched of the Earth, he writes
about an Algerian rebel afflicted
with "insomnia accompanied by
anxiety and suicidal obsessions."
His condition was directly
traceable to the time when ten
people were killed by a bomb he
had planted. That is not being
liberated.
However, I do concede that
there are other cases where the
slave kills his slave personality
with violence and is freed. But I
am not that kind of slave. Here I
disagree with Tom Hayden and
others. White radical students are
not oppressed. White radicals do
not see their sisters starve to death
at age two, do not have their
mothers raped by the soldiers of
an occupation army, and do not
cut sugar cane seven days a week
for eighty cents a day. Different
means should be used to solve the
problems (e.g., educational gripes,
Radical Studies) of white radical
students. This assertion does not
preclude the use (when necessary)
of more extreme tactics to stop
imperialism and racism.
Lost Love
The graffiti on the
construction site wall: "SDS: All
you need is love." The Movement
has lost too much of its love. And
attitude is of immense
importance. We have set for
ourselves the gargantuan task of
building a human society (An;
don't start that stuff about the
rebel being driven to revolt and
not having to have a blueprint for
the new society? we are going to
build a good society.), and we will
fail to do it if we are inhuman
people. One SDS member said,
"We'll have to become inhuman
so our children will be able to be
human." No. It won't work out
that way.
One example of the
dehumanization within the
Movement is that whether or not
we care about the stealing of
Encina secretary's typewriter or
of the two non-war-related theses
at AEL, it is for purely political
reasons. We don't let the humane
researchers back into AEL at the
beginning because it puts us in a
good bargaining position, and we
finally do let them back in
because the action makes us look
good and gains community
support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.

violence against people. Moreover,
the poor still use nonviolence in
some cases.
A girl in a dormitory discussion
group was voicing her
apprehensions of taking a life or
using violent methods. So some
SDSer very analytically (not to
say patronizingly) said, "Let's
look into your background to find
what has given you this hangup
with violence." Well, screw you!
Let's look into your background
to see where your hangup with
burning babies or rat-bitten
children originated.
I am more afraid of the
ex-pacifists eager to try out their
new toys than of those who never
pacifists. And I am sick of hearing
of encounter groups where they
plan shoot-the-trustees.
Fair Play
The new word that we are
outside the system, outlaws,
makes anything fair play. When
you couple this with a bastardized
version of the socialist ideal, you
get people saying, "Well, it's only
property." when a Columbia
professor's research is burned. The
research was on some aspect of
the Middle Ages, not CBW. (Mark
Rudd denies that the students
burned the research, but whether
or not this is true, this attitude

persists.) I do distinguish between
violence against property (e.g.,
Art Melville's recent raid on Dow
Chemicals) and violence against
people. But there are cases like
the research example where
violence again property is very
damaging violence against people.
Then in order to further
accomodate the new type of
tactic, you have some radical
making statements like "Violence
is liberating, read Fanon." Well,
shit, I've read Fanon, too. In his
case studies at the end of The
Wretched of the Earth, he writes
about an Algerian rebel afflicted
with "insomnia accompanied by
anxiety and suicidal obsessions."
His condition was directly
traceable to the time when ten
people were killed by a bomb he
had planted. That is not being
liberated.
However, I do concede that
there are other cases where the
slave kills his slave personality
with violence and is freed. But I
am not that kind of slave. Here I
disagree with Tom Hayden and
others. White radical students are
not oppressed. White radicals do
not see their sisters starve to death
at age two, do not have their
mothers raped by the soldiers of
an occupation army, and do not
cut sugar cane seven days a week
for eighty cents a day. Different
means should be used to solve the
problems (e.g., educational gripes,
Radical Studies) of white radical
students. This assertion does not
preclude the use (when necessary)
of more extreme tactics to stop
imperialism and racism.
Lost Love
The graffiti on the
construction site wall: "SDS: All
you need is love." The Movement
has lost too much of its love. And
attitude is of immense
importance. We have set for
ourselves the gargantuan task of
building a human society (An;
don't start that stuff about the
rebel being driven to revolt and
not having to have a blueprint for
the new society? we are going to
build a good society.), and we will
fail to do it if we are inhuman
people. One SDS member said,
"We'll have to become inhuman
so our children will be able to be
human." No. It won't work out
that way.
One example of the
dehumanization within the
Movement is that whether or not
we care about the stealing of
Encina secretary's typewriter or
of the two non-war-related theses
at AEL, it is for purely political
reasons. We don't let the humane
researchers back into AEL at the
beginning because it puts us in a
good bargaining position, and we
finally do let them back in
because the action makes us look
good and gains community
support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.
Staughton Lynd had a column
in the Guardian, a radical weekly,
this summer called The Good
Society. In one issue he said that
police should not be called pigs.
They are only the tools of
repression, and are, moreover,
members of the proletariat. He
quoted from Cleaver's Soul on
Ice: "The price of hating other
human beings is loving oneself

less." Lynd's column was soon
discontinued in the Guardian.
Contradiction
Last fall I mentioned this to
one SDSer who said, "No, man,
you need hate. You need to have
people hate Johnson to mobilize
them." This implies a pretty low
view of man: he is an animal that
can show concern over social evils
only after he has been whipped
into a mouth-foaming rage. It is a
view in direct contradiction to
that of SDS's founding charter
which says, "We regard men as
infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for
reason, freedom, and love." Look,
1 don't liate Johnson, David
Rockefeller, or Pitzer. I just want
to get them off the backs of the
people of the Third World and the
ghetto. And pretty much any
way. But hate is a thing of the
little man. Nietzsche would call it
a product of a slave morality.
Before I revised this, I got into
a discussion of the uses of hate.
Every revolution I know of has
been preceded by an obvious
hatred fo; the ruiing elite. But
then every revolution I've looked
at has had the terrorized
aftermath that I'd like to avoid.
Hate, according to Coleman's
Community Conflict, is "part of
the process of stripping for
action." Coleman also says, "Men
have a strong need for
consistency. If I disagree violently
with someone, then it becomes
psychologically more comfortable
to see him as totally black than
grey."
Here we have to go into cost
accounting. Hate does help
mobilize. But it also can hurt
innocent people. And by seeing
the other side as totally evil, by
depersonalizing him, one loses
much of that faculty of sympathy
that is part of his own humanity.
He depersonalizes himself. I think
this is what Cleaver meant. Again,
inhuman people do not make
human societies. There are other
feelings we can use to mobilize.
Hate is not necessary for outrage.
Punishment
Which brings us to the
punishme: problem. Steve Smith
likes to teli the story about one of
Fidel Castro's speeches. Castro
was telling the crowd how many
believe that they should not stop
until the last counter
revolutionary's head is chopped
off. The crowd cheered. But, he
continued, the Cuban people have
a better way to do it. The
counterrevolutionaries will be
rehabilitated by forced labor. The
crowd yelled back, "No! Chop off
their heads! Chop of their heads!"
I don't think it is a funny
anecdote.
Punishment to make a man
"pay for his sins against the
people" is part of the slave
morality all over again. We've got
to get beyond this good-and-evil
jazz. Oppressors should be
prevented from continuing their
oppression. That's all.
I know we're in no position to
chop off all the ruling class heads
in this country right now, but we
are in a position to hurt people
needlessly.
I fear for the Movement. We
have a chance to end a lot of this
suffering and to create a good
society. And we could blow that
chance so easily.
(Jeff Weil is a sophomore in
physics- Ed.)
I haven't solved it. But what I
would like this column and
subsequent ones to be is a kind of
wondering out loud that will help
the Movement by questioning it. I
do not intend it to hinder the
Movement. More specifically, if it
slows the drive on the SRI
research, it will have defeated its
purposes.
But to the problem: I find it
difficult to be a pacifist. One of
the greatest contradictions to this
position is the success of the
Cuban Revolution. One can
answer the old hypothetical
questions (e.g., "If you had a
choice between killing and being
killed, would you sacrifice your
own life?") affirmatively and still
reject pacifism. The new question
in light of Cuba is "If you are
living under an oppressive
government, and you know that
the only way you can end the
misery of most of its people is by
picking up a rifle, would you do
it?"
Before the Cuban Revolution,
80% of the people were living on
starvation wages, hospitals were
scarce and only those who could
afford a doctor got one, illiteracy
was the rule, and racism even kept
Batista off the beach of the
Havana Biltmore because he had
black blood. Today everyone eats,
though none eat excessively well,
medical care is free and more
widely available, the literacy
campaign of 1961 has made Cuba
nearly completely literate,
education is universal, and racism
(at least institutional racism) has
been eliminated. Even the
subjective needs of the people
have been filled by making
entertainment and art available to
the masses and by constructing
the idea of the "New Man of the
Twentieth Century." This
development was initiated
through the use of violence.
Revolution against an
oppressive regime is just. It is not
really a question of violence of
nonviolence. Because of the high
infant mortality rates in Latin
America, for instance, by not
taking the (usually) necessarily
violent action, one is perpetuating
the violence of the status quo.
Grisly
I realize that revolutions are
grisly affairs. Sometimes the
Vietcong mutiliate a GI prisoner
and leave him in the path of
oncoming U.S. troops. The way I

had this explained to me was that
the Vietcong cannot possibly
defeat the U.S. army by military
might. It is a psychological war,
and when the troops see their
buddy lying mangled in the road,
it tears hell out of their morale,
thus contributing to an NLF
victory. But—but it is absolutely
necessary that the NLF win for
the good of the Vietnamese.
It should also be noted that the
guerrilla battles in Guatemala and
Vietnam were not begun until the
nonviolent methods proved
ineffective. Father Melville, a
. Maryknoll priest who helped the
Guatemalan guerrillas, tells how
he tried co-operative farming
systems and banking and
recruiting university students to
work with the campesinos before
he was convinced that guerrilla
action would be the only effective
means of social change. Nguyen
Tho, leader of the NLF, was jailed
in Saigon for his activities as a
lawyer attempting to legally
reunite Vietnam (by
implementing the Geneva
Accords) before he started the
guerrilla movement.
It could be extrapolated from
this that if revolution is a right of
the oppressed in the Third World
(an; in the ghetto), it is the
imperative of their brothers who
live in the country which is the
direct and real cause of their
oppression. No action against its
government would be too
extreme. However, let us treat the
problem of revolution in America
in a separate column.
Values Lost
The Movement has become
increasingly violent. In the
transition from flower- to
brick-throwing, a lot of human
values have been lost. I am
disturbed by this. Moreover, a
new bullshit ideology has evolved
to substantiate the new tactics.
Like the line of many SDS
people that nonviolence is a
middle-class hangup. Crap. The
middle-class eats up Bonnie and
Clyde and sends the police to
shoot the looters when it might
have a television taken from its
shop windows. The middle class is
much more hung up with violence
against property than with
violence against people. Moreover,
the poor still use nonviolence in
some cases.

But to the problem: I find it
difficult to be a pacifist. One of
the greatest contradictions to this
position is the success of the
Cuban Revolution. One can
answer the old hypothetical
questions (e.g., "If you had a
choice between killing and being
killed, would you sacrifice your
own life?") affirmatively and still
reject pacifism. The new question
in light of Cuba is "If you are
living under an oppressive
government, and you know that
the only way you can end the
misery of most of its people is by
picking up a rifle, would you do
it?"
Before the Cuban Revolution,
80% of the people were living on
starvation wages, hospitals were
scarce and only those who could
afford a doctor got one, illiteracy
was the rule, and racism even kept
Batista off the beach of the
Havana Biltmore because he had
black blood. Today everyone eats,
though none eat excessively well,
medical care is free and more
widely available, the literacy
campaign of 1961 has made Cuba
nearly completely literate,
education is universal, and racism
(at least institutional racism) has
been eliminated. Even the
subjective needs of the people
have been filled by making
entertainment and art available to
the masses and by constructing
the idea of the "New Man of the
Twentieth Century." This
development was initiated
through the use of violence.
Revolution against an
oppressive regime is just. It is not
really a question of violence of
nonviolence. Because of the high
infant mortality rates in Latin
America, for instance, by not
taking the (usually) necessarily
violent action, one is perpetuating
the violence of the status quo.
Grisly
I realize that revolutions are
grisly affairs. Sometimes the
Vietcong mutiliate a GI prisoner
and leave him in the path of
oncoming U.S. troops. The way I

had this explained to me was that
the Vietcong cannot possibly
defeat the U.S. army by military
might. It is a psychological war,
and when the troops see their
buddy lying mangled in the road,
it tears hell out of their morale,
thus contributing to an NLF
victory. But—but it is absolutely
necessary that the NLF win for
the good of the Vietnamese.
It should also be noted that the
guerrilla battles in Guatemala and
Vietnam were not begun until the
nonviolent methods proved
ineffective. Father Melville, a
. Maryknoll priest who helped the
Guatemalan guerrillas, tells how
he tried co-operative farming
systems and banking and
recruiting university students to
work with the campesinos before
he was convinced that guerrilla
action would be the only effective
means of social change. Nguyen
Tho, leader of the NLF, was jailed
in Saigon for his activities as a
lawyer attempting to legally
reunite Vietnam (by
implementing the Geneva
Accords) before he started the
guerrilla movement.
It could be extrapolated from
this that if revolution is a right of
the oppressed in the Third World
(an; in the ghetto), it is the
imperative of their brothers who
live in the country which is the
direct and real cause of their
oppression. No action against its
government would be too
extreme. However, let us treat the
problem of revolution in America
in a separate column.
Values Lost
The Movement has become
increasingly violent. In the
transition from flower- to
brick-throwing, a lot of human
values have been lost. I am
disturbed by this. Moreover, a
new bullshit ideology has evolved
to substantiate the new tactics.
Like the line of many SDS
people that nonviolence is a
middle-class hangup. Crap. The
middle-class eats up Bonnie and
Clyde and sends the police to
shoot the looters when it might
have a television taken from its
shop windows. The middle class is
much more hung up with violence
against property than with
violence against people. Moreover,
the poor still use nonviolence in
some cases.
A girl in a dormitory discussion
group was voicing her
apprehensions of taking a life or
using violent methods. So some
SDSer very analytically (not to
say patronizingly) said, "Let's
look into your background to find
what has given you this hangup
with violence." Well, screw you!
Let's look into your background
to see where your hangup with
burning babies or rat-bitten
children originated.
I am more afraid of the
ex-pacifists eager to try out their
new toys than of those who never
pacifists. And I am sick of hearing
of encounter groups where they
plan shoot-the-trustees.
Fair Play
The new word that we are
outside the system, outlaws,
makes anything fair play. When
you couple this with a bastardized
version of the socialist ideal, you
get people saying, "Well, it's only
property." when a Columbia
professor's research is burned. The
research was on some aspect of
the Middle Ages, not CBW. (Mark
Rudd denies that the students
burned the research, but whether
or not this is true, this attitude

persists.) I do distinguish between
violence against property (e.g.,
Art Melville's recent raid on Dow
Chemicals) and violence against
people. But there are cases like
the research example where
violence again property is very
damaging violence against people.
Then in order to further
accomodate the new type of
tactic, you have some radical
making statements like "Violence
is liberating, read Fanon." Well,
shit, I've read Fanon, too. In his
case studies at the end of The
Wretched of the Earth, he writes
about an Algerian rebel afflicted
with "insomnia accompanied by
anxiety and suicidal obsessions."
His condition was directly
traceable to the time when ten
people were killed by a bomb he
had planted. That is not being
liberated.
However, I do concede that
there are other cases where the
slave kills his slave personality
with violence and is freed. But I
am not that kind of slave. Here I
disagree with Tom Hayden and
others. White radical students are
not oppressed. White radicals do
not see their sisters starve to death
at age two, do not have their
mothers raped by the soldiers of
an occupation army, and do not
cut sugar cane seven days a week
for eighty cents a day. Different
means should be used to solve the
problems (e.g., educational gripes,
Radical Studies) of white radical
students. This assertion does not
preclude the use (when necessary)
of more extreme tactics to stop
imperialism and racism.
Lost Love
The graffiti on the
construction site wall: "SDS: All
you need is love." The Movement
has lost too much of its love. And
attitude is of immense
importance. We have set for
ourselves the gargantuan task of
building a human society (An;
don't start that stuff about the
rebel being driven to revolt and
not having to have a blueprint for
the new society? we are going to
build a good society.), and we will
fail to do it if we are inhuman
people. One SDS member said,
"We'll have to become inhuman
so our children will be able to be
human." No. It won't work out
that way.
One example of the
dehumanization within the
Movement is that whether or not
we care about the stealing of
Encina secretary's typewriter or
of the two non-war-related theses
at AEL, it is for purely political
reasons. We don't let the humane
researchers back into AEL at the
beginning because it puts us in a
good bargaining position, and we
finally do let them back in
because the action makes us look
good and gains community
support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.
Staughton Lynd had a column
in the Guardian, a radical weekly,
this summer called The Good
Society. In one issue he said that
police should not be called pigs.
They are only the tools of
repression, and are, moreover,
members of the proletariat. He
quoted from Cleaver's Soul on
Ice: "The price of hating other
human beings is loving oneself

less." Lynd's column was soon
discontinued in the Guardian.
Contradiction
Last fall I mentioned this to
one SDSer who said, "No, man,
you need hate. You need to have
people hate Johnson to mobilize
them." This implies a pretty low
view of man: he is an animal that
can show concern over social evils
only after he has been whipped
into a mouth-foaming rage. It is a
view in direct contradiction to
that of SDS's founding charter
which says, "We regard men as
infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for
reason, freedom, and love." Look,
1 don't liate Johnson, David
Rockefeller, or Pitzer. I just want
to get them off the backs of the
people of the Third World and the
ghetto. And pretty much any
way. But hate is a thing of the
little man. Nietzsche would call it
a product of a slave morality.
Before I revised this, I got into
a discussion of the uses of hate.
Every revolution I know of has
been preceded by an obvious
hatred fo; the ruiing elite. But
then every revolution I've looked
at has had the terrorized
aftermath that I'd like to avoid.
Hate, according to Coleman's
Community Conflict, is "part of
the process of stripping for
action." Coleman also says, "Men
have a strong need for
consistency. If I disagree violently
with someone, then it becomes
psychologically more comfortable
to see him as totally black than
grey."
Here we have to go into cost
accounting. Hate does help
mobilize. But it also can hurt
innocent people. And by seeing
the other side as totally evil, by
depersonalizing him, one loses
much of that faculty of sympathy
that is part of his own humanity.
He depersonalizes himself. I think
this is what Cleaver meant. Again,
inhuman people do not make
human societies. There are other
feelings we can use to mobilize.
Hate is not necessary for outrage.
Punishment
Which brings us to the
punishme: problem. Steve Smith
likes to teli the story about one of
Fidel Castro's speeches. Castro
was telling the crowd how many
believe that they should not stop
until the last counter
revolutionary's head is chopped
off. The crowd cheered. But, he
continued, the Cuban people have
a better way to do it. The
counterrevolutionaries will be
rehabilitated by forced labor. The
crowd yelled back, "No! Chop off
their heads! Chop of their heads!"
I don't think it is a funny
anecdote.
Punishment to make a man
"pay for his sins against the
people" is part of the slave
morality all over again. We've got
to get beyond this good-and-evil
jazz. Oppressors should be
prevented from continuing their
oppression. That's all.
I know we're in no position to
chop off all the ruling class heads
in this country right now, but we
are in a position to hurt people
needlessly.
I fear for the Movement. We
have a chance to end a lot of this
suffering and to create a good
society. And we could blow that
chance so easily.
(Jeff Weil is a sophomore in
physics- Ed.)
I haven't solved it. But what I
would like this column and
subsequent ones to be is a kind of
wondering out loud that will help
the Movement by questioning it. I
do not intend it to hinder the
Movement. More specifically, if it
slows the drive on the SRI
research, it will have defeated its
purposes.
But to the problem: I find it
difficult to be a pacifist. One of
the greatest contradictions to this
position is the success of the
Cuban Revolution. One can

Society. In one issue he said that
police should not be called pigs.
They are only the tools of
repression, and are, moreover,
members of the proletariat. He
quoted from Cleaver's Soul on
Ice: "The price of hating other
human beings is loving oneself

less." Lynd's column was soon
discontinued in the Guardian.
Contradiction
Last fall I mentioned this to
one SDSer who said, "No, man,
you need hate. You need to have
people hate Johnson to mobilize
them." This implies a pretty low
view of man: he is an animal that
can show concern over social evils
only after he has been whipped
into a mouth-foaming rage. It is a
view in direct contradiction to
that of SDS's founding charter
which says, "We regard men as
infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for
reason, freedom, and love." Look,
1 don't liate Johnson, David
Rockefeller, or Pitzer. I just want
to get them off the backs of the
people of the Third World and the
ghetto. And pretty much any
way. But hate is a thing of the
little man. Nietzsche would call it
a product of a slave morality.
Before I revised this, I got into
a discussion of the uses of hate.
Every revolution I know of has
been preceded by an obvious
hatred fo; the ruiing elite. But
then every revolution I've looked
at has had the terrorized
aftermath that I'd like to avoid.
Hate, according to Coleman's
Community Conflict, is "part of
the process of stripping for
action." Coleman also says, "Men
have a strong need for
consistency. If I disagree violently
with someone, then it becomes
psychologically more comfortable
to see him as totally black than
grey."
Here we have to go into cost
accounting. Hate does help
mobilize. But it also can hurt
innocent people. And by seeing
the other side as totally evil, by
depersonalizing him, one loses
much of that faculty of sympathy
that is part of his own humanity.
He depersonalizes himself. I think
this is what Cleaver meant. Again,
inhuman people do not make
human societies. There are other
feelings we can use to mobilize.
Hate is not necessary for outrage.
Punishment
Which brings us to the
punishme: problem. Steve Smith
likes to teli the story about one of
Fidel Castro's speeches. Castro
was telling the crowd how many
believe that they should not stop
until the last counter
revolutionary's head is chopped
off. The crowd cheered. But, he
continued, the Cuban people have
a better way to do it. The
counterrevolutionaries will be
rehabilitated by forced labor. The
crowd yelled back, "No! Chop off
their heads! Chop of their heads!"
I don't think it is a funny
anecdote.
Punishment to make a man
"pay for his sins against the
people" is part of the slave
morality all over again. We've got
to get beyond this good-and-evil
jazz. Oppressors should be
prevented from continuing their
oppression. That's all.
I know we're in no position to
chop off all the ruling class heads
in this country right now, but we
are in a position to hurt people
needlessly.
I fear for the Movement. We
have a chance to end a lot of this
suffering and to create a good
society. And we could blow that
chance so easily.
(Jeff Weil is a sophomore in
physics- Ed.)
I haven't solved it. But what I
would like this column and
subsequent ones to be is a kind of
wondering out loud that will help
the Movement by questioning it. I
do not intend it to hinder the
Movement. More specifically, if it
slows the drive on the SRI
research, it will have defeated its
purposes.
But to the problem: I find it
difficult to be a pacifist. One of
the greatest contradictions to this
position is the success of the
Cuban Revolution. One can
answer the old hypothetical
questions (e.g., "If you had a
choice between killing and being
killed, would you sacrifice your
own life?") affirmatively and still
reject pacifism. The new question
in light of Cuba is "If you are
living under an oppressive
government, and you know that
the only way you can end the
misery of most of its people is by
picking up a rifle, would you do
it?"
Before the Cuban Revolution,
80% of the people were living on
starvation wages, hospitals were
scarce and only those who could
afford a doctor got one, illiteracy
was the rule, and racism even kept
Batista off the beach of the
Havana Biltmore because he had
black blood. Today everyone eats,
though none eat excessively well,
medical care is free and more
widely available, the literacy
campaign of 1961 has made Cuba
nearly completely literate,
education is universal, and racism
(at least institutional racism) has
been eliminated. Even the
subjective needs of the people
have been filled by making
entertainment and art available to
the masses and by constructing
the idea of the "New Man of the
Twentieth Century." This
development was initiated
through the use of violence.
Revolution against an
oppressive regime is just. It is not
really a question of violence of
nonviolence. Because of the high
infant mortality rates in Latin
America, for instance, by not
taking the (usually) necessarily
violent action, one is perpetuating
the violence of the status quo.
Grisly
I realize that revolutions are
grisly affairs. Sometimes the
Vietcong mutiliate a GI prisoner
and leave him in the path of
oncoming U.S. troops. The way I

had this explained to me was that
the Vietcong cannot possibly
defeat the U.S. army by military
might. It is a psychological war,
and when the troops see their
buddy lying mangled in the road,
it tears hell out of their morale,
thus contributing to an NLF
victory. But—but it is absolutely
necessary that the NLF win for
the good of the Vietnamese.
It should also be noted that the
guerrilla battles in Guatemala and
Vietnam were not begun until the
nonviolent methods proved
ineffective. Father Melville, a
. Maryknoll priest who helped the
Guatemalan guerrillas, tells how
he tried co-operative farming
systems and banking and
recruiting university students to
work with the campesinos before
he was convinced that guerrilla
action would be the only effective
means of social change. Nguyen
Tho, leader of the NLF, was jailed
in Saigon for his activities as a
lawyer attempting to legally
reunite Vietnam (by
implementing the Geneva
Accords) before he started the
guerrilla movement.
It could be extrapolated from
this that if revolution is a right of
the oppressed in the Third World
(an; in the ghetto), it is the
imperative of their brothers who
live in the country which is the
direct and real cause of their
oppression. No action against its
government would be too
extreme. However, let us treat the
problem of revolution in America
in a separate column.
Values Lost
The Movement has become
increasingly violent. In the
transition from flower- to
brick-throwing, a lot of human
values have been lost. I am
disturbed by this. Moreover, a
new bullshit ideology has evolved
to substantiate the new tactics.
Like the line of many SDS
people that nonviolence is a
middle-class hangup. Crap. The
middle-class eats up Bonnie and
Clyde and sends the police to
shoot the looters when it might
have a television taken from its
shop windows. The middle class is
much more hung up with violence
against property than with
violence against people. Moreover,
the poor still use nonviolence in
some cases.
A girl in a dormitory discussion
group was voicing her
apprehensions of taking a life or
using violent methods. So some
SDSer very analytically (not to
say patronizingly) said, "Let's
look into your background to find
what has given you this hangup
with violence." Well, screw you!
Let's look into your background
to see where your hangup with
burning babies or rat-bitten
children originated.
I am more afraid of the
ex-pacifists eager to try out their
new toys than of those who never
pacifists. And I am sick of hearing
of encounter groups where they
plan shoot-the-trustees.
Fair Play
The new word that we are
outside the system, outlaws,
makes anything fair play. When
you couple this with a bastardized
version of the socialist ideal, you
get people saying, "Well, it's only
property." when a Columbia
professor's research is burned. The
research was on some aspect of
the Middle Ages, not CBW. (Mark
Rudd denies that the students
burned the research, but whether
or not this is true, this attitude

persists.) I do distinguish between
violence against property (e.g.,
Art Melville's recent raid on Dow
Chemicals) and violence against
people. But there are cases like
the research example where
violence again property is very
damaging violence against people.
Then in order to further
accomodate the new type of
tactic, you have some radical
making statements like "Violence
is liberating, read Fanon." Well,
shit, I've read Fanon, too. In his
case studies at the end of The
Wretched of the Earth, he writes
about an Algerian rebel afflicted
with "insomnia accompanied by
anxiety and suicidal obsessions."
His condition was directly
traceable to the time when ten
people were killed by a bomb he
had planted. That is not being
liberated.
However, I do concede that
there are other cases where the
slave kills his slave personality
with violence and is freed. But I
am not that kind of slave. Here I
disagree with Tom Hayden and
others. White radical students are
not oppressed. White radicals do
not see their sisters starve to death
at age two, do not have their
mothers raped by the soldiers of
an occupation army, and do not
cut sugar cane seven days a week
for eighty cents a day. Different
means should be used to solve the
problems (e.g., educational gripes,
Radical Studies) of white radical
students. This assertion does not
preclude the use (when necessary)
of more extreme tactics to stop
imperialism and racism.
Lost Love
The graffiti on the
construction site wall: "SDS: All
you need is love." The Movement
has lost too much of its love. And
attitude is of immense
importance. We have set for
ourselves the gargantuan task of
building a human society (An;
don't start that stuff about the
rebel being driven to revolt and
not having to have a blueprint for
the new society? we are going to
build a good society.), and we will
fail to do it if we are inhuman
people. One SDS member said,
"We'll have to become inhuman
so our children will be able to be
human." No. It won't work out
that way.
One example of the
dehumanization within the
Movement is that whether or not
we care about the stealing of
Encina secretary's typewriter or
of the two non-war-related theses
at AEL, it is for purely political
reasons. We don't let the humane
researchers back into AEL at the
beginning because it puts us in a
good bargaining position, and we
finally do let them back in
because the action makes us look
good and gains community
support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.

with violence." Well, screw you!
Let's look into your background
to see where your hangup with
burning babies or rat-bitten
children originated.
I am more afraid of the
ex-pacifists eager to try out their
new toys than of those who never
pacifists. And I am sick of hearing
of encounter groups where they
plan shoot-the-trustees.
Fair Play
The new word that we are
outside the system, outlaws,
makes anything fair play. When
you couple this with a bastardized
version of the socialist ideal, you
get people saying, "Well, it's only
property." when a Columbia
professor's research is burned. The
research was on some aspect of
the Middle Ages, not CBW. (Mark
Rudd denies that the students
burned the research, but whether
or not this is true, this attitude

persists.) I do distinguish between
violence against property (e.g.,
Art Melville's recent raid on Dow
Chemicals) and violence against
people. But there are cases like
the research example where
violence again property is very
damaging violence against people.
Then in order to further
accomodate the new type of
tactic, you have some radical
making statements like "Violence
is liberating, read Fanon." Well,
shit, I've read Fanon, too. In his
case studies at the end of The
Wretched of the Earth, he writes
about an Algerian rebel afflicted
with "insomnia accompanied by
anxiety and suicidal obsessions."
His condition was directly
traceable to the time when ten
people were killed by a bomb he
had planted. That is not being
liberated.
However, I do concede that
there are other cases where the
slave kills his slave personality
with violence and is freed. But I
am not that kind of slave. Here I
disagree with Tom Hayden and
others. White radical students are
not oppressed. White radicals do
not see their sisters starve to death
at age two, do not have their
mothers raped by the soldiers of
an occupation army, and do not
cut sugar cane seven days a week
for eighty cents a day. Different
means should be used to solve the
problems (e.g., educational gripes,
Radical Studies) of white radical
students. This assertion does not
preclude the use (when necessary)
of more extreme tactics to stop
imperialism and racism.
Lost Love
The graffiti on the
construction site wall: "SDS: All
you need is love." The Movement
has lost too much of its love. And
attitude is of immense
importance. We have set for
ourselves the gargantuan task of
building a human society (An;
don't start that stuff about the
rebel being driven to revolt and
not having to have a blueprint for
the new society? we are going to
build a good society.), and we will
fail to do it if we are inhuman
people. One SDS member said,
"We'll have to become inhuman
so our children will be able to be
human." No. It won't work out
that way.
One example of the
dehumanization within the
Movement is that whether or not
we care about the stealing of
Encina secretary's typewriter or
of the two non-war-related theses
at AEL, it is for purely political
reasons. We don't let the humane
researchers back into AEL at the
beginning because it puts us in a
good bargaining position, and we
finally do let them back in
because the action makes us look
good and gains community
support. Not because we give a
shit about the secretaries, humane
researchers, or other
Guildensterms getting screwed by
our little revolution. I know that
innocent people often get wiped
during necessary social change,
but we should work to minimize
this.
Staughton Lynd had a column
in the Guardian, a radical weekly,
this summer called The Good
Society. In one issue he said that
police should not be called pigs.
They are only the tools of
repression, and are, moreover,
members of the proletariat. He
quoted from Cleaver's Soul on
Ice: "The price of hating other
human beings is loving oneself

less." Lynd's column was soon
discontinued in the Guardian.
Contradiction
Last fall I mentioned this to
one SDSer who said, "No, man,
you need hate. You need to have
people hate Johnson to mobilize
them." This implies a pretty low
view of man: he is an animal that
can show concern over social evils
only after he has been whipped
into a mouth-foaming rage. It is a
view in direct contradiction to
that of SDS's founding charter
which says, "We regard men as
infinitely precious and possessed
of unfulfilled capacities for
reason, freedom, and love." Look,
1 don't liate Johnson, David
Rockefeller, or Pitzer. I just want
to get them off the backs of the
people of the Third World and the
ghetto. And pretty much any
way. But hate is a thing of the
little man. Nietzsche would call it
a product of a slave morality.
Before I revised this, I got into
a discussion of the uses of hate.
Every revolution I know of has
been preceded by an obvious
hatred fo; the ruiing elite. But
then every revolution I've looked
at has had the terrorized
aftermath that I'd like to avoid.
Hate, according to Coleman's
Community Conflict, is "part of
the process of stripping for
action." Coleman also says, "Men
have a strong need for
consistency. If I disagree violently
with someone, then it becomes
psychologically more comfortable
to see him as totally black than
grey."
Here we have to go into cost
accounting. Hate does help
mobilize. But it also can hurt
innocent people. And by seeing
the other side as totally evil, by
depersonalizing him, one loses
much of that faculty of sympathy
that is part of his own humanity.
He depersonalizes himself. I think
this is what Cleaver meant. Again,
inhuman people do not make
human societies. There are other
feelings we can use to mobilize.
Hate is not necessary for outrage.
Punishment
Which brings us to the
punishme: problem. Steve Smith
likes to teli the story about one of
Fidel Castro's speeches. Castro
was telling the crowd how many
believe that they should not stop
until the last counter
revolutionary's head is chopped
off. The crowd cheered. But, he
continued, the Cuban people have
a better way to do it. The
counterrevolutionaries will be
rehabilitated by forced labor. The
crowd yelled back, "No! Chop off
their heads! Chop of their heads!"
I don't think it is a funny
anecdote.
Punishment to make a man
"pay for his sins against the
people" is part of the slave
morality all over again. We've got
to get beyond this good-and-evil
jazz. Oppressors should be
prevented from continuing their
oppression. That's all.
I know we're in no position to
chop off all the ruling class heads
in this country right now, but we
are in a position to hurt people
needlessly.
I fear for the Movement. We
have a chance to end a lot of this
suffering and to create a good
society. And we could blow that
chance so easily.
