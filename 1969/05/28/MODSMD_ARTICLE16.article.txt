## Zapcrisp's Complaint 
### Art Buchwald 
There is no question that there
is a certain amount of hostility in
this country building up toward
the Pentagon. My friend Zapcrisp
was so disturbed by his own
personal feelings that he went to
see his psychiatrist.
"I don't understand it, Doc,"
said Zapcrisp, as he stretched out
on the couch. "I keep feeling that
there's something wrong over
there and I keep getting more
frightened all the time."
''Hmmmmmn,'' the
psychiatrist replied.
"The thing is, I love the
Pentagon. I believe,
architecturally, it is one of the
most beautiful buildings in the
country. But I still can't get this
feeling out of me that they don't
know what they're doing."
"Ah huh," the psychiatrist
commented.
"I guess the first time I got the
sinking feeling was when they
announced the TFX was a
disaster. I mean, I don't mind
paying taxes, but when I heard
the news—after all that money
was spent—l almost got sick. I did
get sick, as a matter of fact. But
then I realized that I was being
irrational and anyone could make
a mistake, so I forget it."
''Tch, tch, tch," the
psychiatrist said.
"Then I got the news about the

ABM. How David Packard said it
would only cost $6 billion, but
then they put out a statement a
few days later saying that he had
forgotten to include the price of
the warheads. Doc, was I being
unreasonable when I got sore? I
mean, what kind of a thing is it to
tell you the price of an
antiballistic missile system and
leave out the cost of the
warheads?"
"Uh huh."
"You still there, Doc? So I said
to myself, 'Packard can't
remember everything,' and I
pulled myself together. Then
there were the stories of the
billion-dollar tank that wouldn't
work, the helicopters that
wouldn't fly. But I figures the
military can't have everything
come out the way they want it.
"I'll tell you another thing,
Doc. I wasn't too happy about
losing the Pueblo, either. But I'm
not a bitter man and I said to
myself, 'If that's where my tax
money has to go, so be it."
"Ummmmmn."
"Yet, I think when they really
got me scared was when they
announced the C-5A airplane was
going to cost over $2 billion more
than they thought it would. I
didn't mind the money, Doc, as
much as the way they kept
juggling the figures—telling me it

wasn't Lockheed, but inflation
and spare parts—and that
everyone knew it was going to
cost $2 billion more, so no one
should be surprised. Doc, do you
know how many psychiatric
sessions $2 billion can buy?"
"Mm hum."
"OK, I was mad, but I kept it
inside of me. I'm not one of these
people who is always criticizing
the military. But then it
happened, Doc. The other night
I'm sitting in front of my
television set watching the news,
and suddenly I see with my own
eyes a $50 million submarine
sinking at the dock in San
Francisco in 35 feet of water.
Doc, I ask you. How much can we
take?
"To top it, they want to move
all their nerve gas across the
United States on freight trains and
dump it off Atlantic City. Doc,
am I wrong in thinking they want
to get me?"
"Mmmm uh."
"And this morning I read in
the papers that they want to
scuttle 10 Polaris submarines in
the ocean because the new
missiles won't fit them. Tell me,
Doc, am I going crazy?"
"So," said the doctor, "now
vee may perhaps to begin. Yes?"

see his psychiatrist.
"I don't understand it, Doc,"
said Zapcrisp, as he stretched out
on the couch. "I keep feeling that
there's something wrong over
there and I keep getting more
frightened all the time."
''Hmmmmmn,'' the
psychiatrist replied.
"The thing is, I love the
Pentagon. I believe,
architecturally, it is one of the
most beautiful buildings in the
country. But I still can't get this
feeling out of me that they don't
know what they're doing."
"Ah huh," the psychiatrist
commented.
"I guess the first time I got the
sinking feeling was when they
announced the TFX was a
disaster. I mean, I don't mind
paying taxes, but when I heard
the news—after all that money
was spent—l almost got sick. I did
get sick, as a matter of fact. But
then I realized that I was being
irrational and anyone could make
a mistake, so I forget it."
''Tch, tch, tch," the
psychiatrist said.
"Then I got the news about the

ABM. How David Packard said it
would only cost $6 billion, but
then they put out a statement a
few days later saying that he had
forgotten to include the price of
the warheads. Doc, was I being
unreasonable when I got sore? I
mean, what kind of a thing is it to
tell you the price of an
antiballistic missile system and
leave out the cost of the
warheads?"
"Uh huh."
"You still there, Doc? So I said
to myself, 'Packard can't
remember everything,' and I
pulled myself together. Then
there were the stories of the
billion-dollar tank that wouldn't
work, the helicopters that
wouldn't fly. But I figures the
military can't have everything
come out the way they want it.
"I'll tell you another thing,
Doc. I wasn't too happy about
losing the Pueblo, either. But I'm
not a bitter man and I said to
myself, 'If that's where my tax
money has to go, so be it."
"Ummmmmn."
"Yet, I think when they really
got me scared was when they
announced the C-5A airplane was
going to cost over $2 billion more
than they thought it would. I
didn't mind the money, Doc, as
much as the way they kept
juggling the figures—telling me it

wasn't Lockheed, but inflation
and spare parts—and that
everyone knew it was going to
cost $2 billion more, so no one
should be surprised. Doc, do you
know how many psychiatric
sessions $2 billion can buy?"
"Mm hum."
"OK, I was mad, but I kept it
inside of me. I'm not one of these
people who is always criticizing
the military. But then it
happened, Doc. The other night
I'm sitting in front of my
television set watching the news,
and suddenly I see with my own
eyes a $50 million submarine
sinking at the dock in San
Francisco in 35 feet of water.
Doc, I ask you. How much can we
take?
"To top it, they want to move
all their nerve gas across the
United States on freight trains and
dump it off Atlantic City. Doc,
am I wrong in thinking they want
to get me?"
"Mmmm uh."
"And this morning I read in
the papers that they want to
scuttle 10 Polaris submarines in
the ocean because the new
missiles won't fit them. Tell me,
Doc, am I going crazy?"
"So," said the doctor, "now
vee may perhaps to begin. Yes?"
There is no question that there
is a certain amount of hostility in
this country building up toward
the Pentagon. My friend Zapcrisp
was so disturbed by his own
personal feelings that he went to
see his psychiatrist.
"I don't understand it, Doc,"
said Zapcrisp, as he stretched out
on the couch. "I keep feeling that
there's something wrong over
there and I keep getting more
frightened all the time."
