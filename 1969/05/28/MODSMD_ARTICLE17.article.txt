## Hoover Tower Is Still A Paper Penis 
### Steve Smith 
Peter Stern's article in
yesterday's Daily fails to focus on
the major issue in the Hoover
controversy: the research and
intellectual work of the
Institution's staff.
If there were only a couple of
reactionaries on the staff no one
would be upset. But almost every
major appointment within the
past decade has gone to
professional anti-communists.
Begin with Richard Staar who
becomes Associate Director in the
summer. In the early fifties, Staar
worked for the CIA. Later he
taught at Arkansas Harding
College, one of the major sources
of right-wing propaganda in the
country. Staar spent 1963-64 at
the Naval War College and
between 1967-69 was a professor
at the National War College.
Executive Assistant
In 1966, Alan Belmont joined
the Hoover staff as Director Glenn
Campbell's executive assistant.
Previously, Belmont spent 29

years with the FBI. He played a
key role in witch-hunts like the
Smith Act and Hiss cases.
Between 1961-66 he supervised all
national security investigations.
Other major appointments
include Richard V. Allen, Milorad
Drachkovitch, Roger Freeman,
Stefan Possony, and Campbell.
Allen has co-authored a high
school text book called
Democracy and Communism. The
book's purpose is indicated by its
final review question, "What is to
be done by us if we are to win the
Cold War?''
Drachkovitch recently wrote a
lengthy paper about the new left
which the Bar Association's
Standing Comm i 11 e e on
Flducation about Communism and
Its Contrasts with Liberty Under
Law will soon publish. Here is a
thorough analysis of the new left
which neglects the crucial
questions that counterinsurgents
always neglect: is the insurgency
justified?

Check out Roger Freeman's
Socialism and Private I Enterprise
in Equatorial Asia for an example
of ideology interfering with
scholarship. As the anti-Marxist
reviewer for the authoratative
Journal of Asian Studies says the
book is ''ideologically
strait-jacketed." Freeman simply
wrote "another capitalist
manifesto."
Possony is the real plum.
Through consultation for the Air
Force, research for Congress,
lectures at. the war colleges, and
publications in books, magazines,
and right wing newsletters he
helped lead the past decade's
battle for more missiles, bigger
nuclear warheads, more nuclear
tests, escalation in Vietnam and
more ABMs.
The quality of one of
Possony's books, The Geography
of Intellect is indicated by a long
sentence: "The inciting of the
Arab and Negro masses of Africa
to race conflict against the white

minority not only has resulted in
the perpetration of unspeakable
crimes against the only
technologically and managerially
capable element on that
continent, but is condemning the
Negro and Muslim masses to a
future of choas, havoc, hunger,
savage dictatorship and regression
from order and freedom."
I vils of Marxism
Finally there is the Director,
W. Glenn Campbell who according
to all accounts is responsible for
all the other appointments. Soon
after Herbert Hoover chose
Campbell as Director in 1960,
controversy arose over the
ex-President's statement that the
purpose of the Institution was to
"demonstrate the evils of the
doctrines of Karl Marx."
Questioned by the Daily about
Hoover's statement, Campbell
replied, "I see nothing wrong with
it, do you?" He also said, "There
are evils in Marxism and I hope we
expose them."
Campbell's views are shared by
almost every major appointee to
the Hoover staff. The

preponderance of right-wingers
and professional anti-communists
in key positions gives the entire
Institution such an orientation.
Whether such an orientation
serves the needs of people is a
question likely to be hotly
debated come September.
