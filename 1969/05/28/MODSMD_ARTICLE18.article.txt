## What Liberal Alternative? 
### Brad Cornell 
If American culture is truly in
a state of decay then we must
look beyond the bungling of
elected officials for the source of
our social ills. If there is to be a
movement for social reform it
must attempt to explain and come
to terms with the most basic
problems which plague our
nation. In this regard radical
students have turned to what is
essentially a Marxist
revolutionary's analysis in their
quest to understand and reform
American society.
Many students, however, have
dissented from this position
claiming to share many of the
goals of the radicals, such as the
reordering of America's priorities,
but stating that they could not
accept the tactics employed by
the more militant students.
Among the proponents of this
position are a great majority of
the 1643 students who voted, at
the Frost general meeting of April
19, to take action if the Trustee
decision of May 13 did not take
into account the demands set
forth by the April Third
Movement.
The fact is that no more than
300 of those students ever acted.
Though the April Third
Movement employed tactics as
varied as orderly pickets,
phone-ins, letter writing
campaigns, and active disruptions
only about 4 00 people
participated and at least 100 of
these people were not card
carrying Stanford students and
hence could not have voted at
Frost.
The immediate question is,
what kept most of the morally
concerned students from acting?
Even if they rejected all the plans
for action put forth by the
Movement they could most
certainly have taken personal
action. Why then were so many
overcome with apathy?
Inability
It is my contention that the
cause of this apathy is not the
lack of moral conscience but the
inability of most Stanford
students, indeed most Americans,
to form a vision of society whose
basic unit is not the atomized
individual.
If one views society as little
more than a conglomeration of
competing individuals then
community and humanity become
mere intellectual abstractions. As
a consequence of this world-view
studying for a midterm takes
natural precedence over picketing
SRI to help end CBW research.
As this pattern of decision
making becomes habituated the
problem intensifies. By always
delegating his social conscience to
second place in his list of
priorities the individual is
manifesting the sickness of which
he accuses American society. By
rejecting the moral imperative as
the primary criterion for action
the experience of morality
becomes increasingly vague and
amorphous. That is moral life
loses its importance for the
individual; it is no longer taken
with the utmost seriousness.

"Practical" considerations such as
G.P.A. further assert their
dominance.
Alienation
As the process continues the
individual loses all sense of the
social self, he becomes the slave of
his own ambition, he begins to
interpret his personal life in terms
of external success. The natural
result is the most acute kind of
alienation. Unfortunately instead
of reacting to this alienation by
reaffirming one's own moral
experience and by gathering the
course to act on it, the typical
response is a retreat into
mysticism or further ambition.
Viewed in this light it becomes
clear that those who claim to
share the goals of the radicals, but
reject their tactics, in fact reject
the goals also; for their very
behavior negates the vision of the
classes society or social whole
which is at the heart of the radical
ideology. As long as a majority of
Stanford's "liberals" carry within
them the same characteristics they
reject in our society they can
hardly be viewed as justifiable
force for social reform; nor can

their criticism of the radicals be
interpreted as more than the
continuous ull erin go 112
disingenous platitudes.
If the moderate reformists at
Stanford hope to offer an
alternative to radicalism then they
must produce an analysis of
society which explains and offers
a means of overcoming the evils
they reject. Furthermore they
must summon the courage to act
on their beliefs as so many
radicals have this spring.

individual loses all sense of the
social self, he becomes the slave of
his own ambition, he begins to
interpret his personal life in terms
of external success. The natural
result is the most acute kind of
alienation. Unfortunately instead
of reacting to this alienation by
reaffirming one's own moral
experience and by gathering the
course to act on it, the typical
response is a retreat into
mysticism or further ambition.
Viewed in this light it becomes
clear that those who claim to
share the goals of the radicals, but
reject their tactics, in fact reject
the goals also; for their very
behavior negates the vision of the
classes society or social whole
which is at the heart of the radical
ideology. As long as a majority of
Stanford's "liberals" carry within
them the same characteristics they
reject in our society they can
hardly be viewed as justifiable
force for social reform; nor can

their criticism of the radicals be
interpreted as more than the
continuous ull erin go 112
disingenous platitudes.
If the moderate reformists at
Stanford hope to offer an
alternative to radicalism then they
must produce an analysis of
society which explains and offers
a means of overcoming the evils
they reject. Furthermore they
must summon the courage to act
on their beliefs as so many
radicals have this spring.

If American culture is truly in
a state of decay then we must
look beyond the bungling of
elected officials for the source of
our social ills. If there is to be a
movement for social reform it
must attempt to explain and come
to terms with the most basic
problems which plague our
nation. In this regard radical
students have turned to what is
essentially a Marxist
revolutionary's analysis in their
quest to understand and reform
American society.
Many students, however, have
dissented from this position
claiming to share many of the
goals of the radicals, such as the
reordering of America's priorities,
but stating that they could not
accept the tactics employed by
the more militant students.
Among the proponents of this
position are a great majority of
the 1643 students who voted, at
the Frost general meeting of April
19, to take action if the Trustee
decision of May 13 did not take
into account the demands set
forth by the April Third
Movement.
The fact is that no more than
300 of those students ever acted.
Though the April Third
Movement employed tactics as
varied as orderly pickets,
phone-ins, letter writing
campaigns, and active disruptions
only about 4 00 people
participated and at least 100 of
these people were not card
carrying Stanford students and
hence could not have voted at
Frost.
The immediate question is,
what kept most of the morally
concerned students from acting?
Even if they rejected all the plans
for action put forth by the
Movement they could most
certainly have taken personal
action. Why then were so many
overcome with apathy?
Inability
It is my contention that the
cause of this apathy is not the
lack of moral conscience but the
inability of most Stanford
students, indeed most Americans,
to form a vision of society whose
basic unit is not the atomized
individual.
If one views society as little
more than a conglomeration of
competing individuals then
community and humanity become
mere intellectual abstractions. As
a consequence of this world-view
studying for a midterm takes
natural precedence over picketing
SRI to help end CBW research.
As this pattern of decision
making becomes habituated the
problem intensifies. By always
delegating his social conscience to
second place in his list of
priorities the individual is
manifesting the sickness of which
he accuses American society. By
rejecting the moral imperative as
the primary criterion for action
the experience of morality
becomes increasingly vague and
amorphous. That is moral life
loses its importance for the
individual; it is no longer taken
with the utmost seriousness.

"Practical" considerations such as
G.P.A. further assert their
dominance.
Alienation
As the process continues the
individual loses all sense of the
social self, he becomes the slave of
his own ambition, he begins to
interpret his personal life in terms
of external success. The natural
