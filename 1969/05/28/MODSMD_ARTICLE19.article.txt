# CAC Defines Purpose
## 
### JIM GALLOWAY 
Sensing a need for an effective
means of dealing not only with
the immediate problem created by
the A3M, but with future
disruptions as well, a small group
of students and faculty set out to
establish what is now the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC).
"The University must develop
a means of dealing with these
destructive acts, while preserving
its vital attributes of political
diversity and academic freedom,"

stated CAC President Jim
Schnieder.
After one month of life, the
CAC has approximately '200
members, has maintained an
intensive campaign to counter the
disruptive activity of the A3M,
and has begun two positive
programs that are aimed at
improving channels of
communication within the
University.
One is a petition which calls
for a procedure whereby students
could receive hearings before

regular meetings of the Board of
Trustees.
The other is a pre-registration
orientation program for incoming
freshmen and transfer students.
Among programs being
investigated are a faculty speaker
program for the student living
units, and the promotion of a
children's day care facility which
could serve as a model for
industry. These are indeed
ambitious plans, but the level of
interest and support shown by a
broad cross-section of the
community indicate that they can
be accomplished.
The CAC is open to all
members of the Stanford
community: students, faculty,
administration, staff and alumni.
Its policies have been moderate,
and its programs have been, and
will continue to be, progressive.
The CAC hopes that its future
will be concerned with building a
belter Stanford rather than having
to react to illegal campus
disruptions. But if such
disruptions do occur, the CAC
intends to be ready to give a voice
to those who oppose the use of
violence and intimidation as a
means of achieving change.
