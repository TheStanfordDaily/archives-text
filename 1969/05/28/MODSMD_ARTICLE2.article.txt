# AEL Team May Move To SRI
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
Since the AEL sit-in and the faculty's
ban on classified research, intensive
discussions have been underway to find
a new home for the Stanford research
teams that work on classified contracts.
The most likely new home, according
to a number of researchers, is the
Stanford Research Institute.
"Various local institutions" have
shown interest in absorbing the applied
electronics research groups, according to
a statement given the Daily by a
researcher in the Stanford Electronics
Lab (SEL). "However, serious
consideration has been given to only
one: SRI," he said.
Two separate teams within the
Stanford Electronics Lab (SEL) are
affected: the entire Systems Techniques
Lab (STL), which occupies the second
floor of the AEL building, and a
radiosciences group under Prof. O. G.
Villard.
Contracts Must Move
Seven contracts, totaling more than
$2 million, will have to be moved
outside the University, according to
Prof. William Rambo, SEL director.
More than 100 professional researchers,
nonprofessional employees, students
and faculty will be affected.
The research at AEL has included
electronic countermeasures now used by
Air Force tactical bombers. The April
3rd Movement, which led the AEL sit-in
April 9-18, demanded an end to such
work both on the campus and at SRI.
On April 24, the faculty senate
prohibited further classified contracts.
Engineering school dean John Petit
announced he would "phase out" such
work.
Besides SRI, individuals and small
groups of electronics researchers have
considered joining industrial firms in the
area or forming their own small
electronics company. But the majority
of the Systems Techniques Lab (STL) is

favorable to SRI, according to several
researchers, because they strongly prefer
working in a non-profit institution.
Frequent meetings of the entire
Systems Techniques Lab staff have
taken place since the sit-in. The debate
and uncertainty has made it "difficult
to work," according to one researcher.
There is great pressure to complete the
move from Stanford by September, he
said.
Another researcher predicted that a
group of the more "enterprising"
engineers at STL will form their own
private company with expertise in
circuit design. A much larger group of
administrators, professionals and
nonprofessionals will move to an
institute together, he predicted.
Move Is Natural
To many STL staff, a move to SRI
seems natural. "The suggestion that STL
belongs to SRI has been made for the
eight years I've been around here," said
one researcher. STL's emphasis on
applied military research has been
criticized as unsuitable in a University,
but SRI does large amounts of such
work, including electronic warfare
research very similar to some STL
contracts.
"Thee are many points which make
(an SRI) alliance attractive," said
another STL researcher. "The applied
electronics programs of SRI and STL
are in many ways complementary . . .
There has been some contact between
the two groups for many years, and
formalizing the relationships has been
mentioned in the past."
This researcher and others predicted
that most of the STL group will "stick
together in one fashion or another."
STL has much to offer SRI or any
other organization, says Rambo. "It is a
remarkably talented group. Its most
important asset is this talent, especially
to the extent that it is multiplied by the
group's cohesiveness," said Rambo. A

researcher pointed out also that STL's
contract administrators have invaluable
personal contacts with the men in the
Defense Department who issue research
contracts.
Prof. Villard's radiosciences group,
which is separate from STL, will
definitely move outside the University.
Villard confirmed this yesterday but
would not discuss the alternatives. The
radiosciences department already shares
several antennas with SRI.
Petit and Rambo said yesterday that
it is "too early" for them to discuss the
negotiations underway with SRI and
others. "The SRI thing is theoretical
and can't be worked out practically
until it is known what status SRI will
have in the future," said Petit. The
Board of Trustees has announced that
SRI will be severed from the University,
but they have not announced whether it
will remain non-profit or be sold to
industry.
Ray Leadabrand, director of SRl's
Electronics and Radiosciences Division,
replied "No comment" to questions last
night on the status of the negotiations
with Stanford researchers.
Unhappy Researchers
The departure of the research teams
reflects a general unhappiness among
many engineers with University policy.
"For 18 years I've been doing the best
job I can for the University and the
country, and now I've been kicked in
the teeth," said one AEL researcher.
"I'm a victim of the revolution."
Another researcher commented,
"People with four kids and a mortgage
had planned on working here as a life
career. Now life seems to be collapsing."
The 35 graduate students employed
on unclassified portions of the STL
program will also have to find new
work. Petit says special arrangements
will be made for students who are close
to receiving a degree and want to
continue to work with professionals in
STL when they move.
Besides Villard, Petit says he knows
of no faculty member who will leave in
direct response to the ban on classified
research. But the turmoil on campus has
had an effect, Petit said. "Many faculty
are upset. Other faculty will decide the
University is no longer a place to do
serious research or teaching."
Rambo, has been director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories for
ten years, said he hopes to remain at
Stanford, but is not certain. "It depends
on how these other arrangements work
out," Rambo said, referring to the plans
of STL researchers to move to industry
or a non-profit institute. "I want to
make sure that the people involved in
these programs are not put at some
disadvantage," said Rambo.
In a letter May 6 to Charles
Anderson, SRI President, Rambo noted
that "program nature and staff
make-up" of the STL program "align it
to some degree with research activities
at SRI." The letter warned Anderson
against the dangers of continued
affiliation with the University.
The loss to the University from the
AEL sit-in and the ban on classified
research will include at least $500,000
yearly in overhead recovery on the lost
contracts, according to Petit. But he
expects much wider repercussions to
universities that have restricted ROTC
or classified research.
"There is a real possibility that there

will be a backlash in Washington. One
thing that might happen is that Congress
might look at the budget and say that
there is too much money going to
universities for research." said Petit.
The departure of the STL staff will
open up the entire second floor of the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL). Petit
expects a new, unclassified research
program will be developed to use the
space. The first floor and basement of
AEL contain general offices for the
entire Stanford Electronics Laboratories
and the entire Engineering School.
Since the AEL sit-in and the faculty's

with Stanford researchers.
Unhappy Researchers
The departure of the research teams
reflects a general unhappiness among
many engineers with University policy.
"For 18 years I've been doing the best
job I can for the University and the
country, and now I've been kicked in
the teeth," said one AEL researcher.
"I'm a victim of the revolution."
Another researcher commented,
"People with four kids and a mortgage
had planned on working here as a life
career. Now life seems to be collapsing."
The 35 graduate students employed
on unclassified portions of the STL
program will also have to find new
work. Petit says special arrangements
will be made for students who are close
to receiving a degree and want to
continue to work with professionals in
STL when they move.
Besides Villard, Petit says he knows
of no faculty member who will leave in
direct response to the ban on classified
research. But the turmoil on campus has
had an effect, Petit said. "Many faculty
are upset. Other faculty will decide the
University is no longer a place to do
serious research or teaching."
Rambo, has been director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories for
ten years, said he hopes to remain at
Stanford, but is not certain. "It depends
on how these other arrangements work
out," Rambo said, referring to the plans
of STL researchers to move to industry
or a non-profit institute. "I want to
make sure that the people involved in
these programs are not put at some
disadvantage," said Rambo.
In a letter May 6 to Charles
Anderson, SRI President, Rambo noted
that "program nature and staff
make-up" of the STL program "align it
to some degree with research activities
at SRI." The letter warned Anderson
against the dangers of continued
affiliation with the University.
The loss to the University from the
AEL sit-in and the ban on classified
research will include at least $500,000
yearly in overhead recovery on the lost
contracts, according to Petit. But he
expects much wider repercussions to
universities that have restricted ROTC
or classified research.
"There is a real possibility that there

will be a backlash in Washington. One
thing that might happen is that Congress
might look at the budget and say that
there is too much money going to
universities for research." said Petit.
The departure of the STL staff will
open up the entire second floor of the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL). Petit
expects a new, unclassified research
program will be developed to use the
space. The first floor and basement of
AEL contain general offices for the
entire Stanford Electronics Laboratories
and the entire Engineering School.
Since the AEL sit-in and the faculty's
ban on classified research, intensive
discussions have been underway to find
a new home for the Stanford research
teams that work on classified contracts.
The most likely new home, according
to a number of researchers, is the
Stanford Research Institute.
"Various local institutions" have
shown interest in absorbing the applied
electronics research groups, according to
a statement given the Daily by a
researcher in the Stanford Electronics
Lab (SEL). "However, serious
consideration has been given to only
one: SRI," he said.
Two separate teams within the
Stanford Electronics Lab (SEL) are
affected: the entire Systems Techniques
Lab (STL), which occupies the second
floor of the AEL building, and a
radiosciences group under Prof. O. G.
Villard.
Contracts Must Move
Seven contracts, totaling more than
$2 million, will have to be moved
outside the University, according to
Prof. William Rambo, SEL director.
More than 100 professional researchers,
nonprofessional employees, students
and faculty will be affected.
The research at AEL has included
electronic countermeasures now used by
Air Force tactical bombers. The April
3rd Movement, which led the AEL sit-in
April 9-18, demanded an end to such
work both on the campus and at SRI.
On April 24, the faculty senate
prohibited further classified contracts.
Engineering school dean John Petit
announced he would "phase out" such
work.
Besides SRI, individuals and small
groups of electronics researchers have
considered joining industrial firms in the
area or forming their own small
electronics company. But the majority
of the Systems Techniques Lab (STL) is

favorable to SRI, according to several
researchers, because they strongly prefer
working in a non-profit institution.
Frequent meetings of the entire
Systems Techniques Lab staff have
taken place since the sit-in. The debate
and uncertainty has made it "difficult
to work," according to one researcher.
There is great pressure to complete the
move from Stanford by September, he
said.
Another researcher predicted that a
group of the more "enterprising"
engineers at STL will form their own
private company with expertise in
circuit design. A much larger group of
administrators, professionals and
nonprofessionals will move to an
institute together, he predicted.
Move Is Natural
To many STL staff, a move to SRI
seems natural. "The suggestion that STL
belongs to SRI has been made for the
eight years I've been around here," said
one researcher. STL's emphasis on
applied military research has been
criticized as unsuitable in a University,
but SRI does large amounts of such
work, including electronic warfare
research very similar to some STL
contracts.
"Thee are many points which make
(an SRI) alliance attractive," said
another STL researcher. "The applied
electronics programs of SRI and STL
are in many ways complementary . . .
There has been some contact between
the two groups for many years, and
formalizing the relationships has been
mentioned in the past."
This researcher and others predicted
that most of the STL group will "stick
together in one fashion or another."
STL has much to offer SRI or any
other organization, says Rambo. "It is a
remarkably talented group. Its most
important asset is this talent, especially
to the extent that it is multiplied by the
group's cohesiveness," said Rambo. A

researcher pointed out also that STL's
contract administrators have invaluable
personal contacts with the men in the
Defense Department who issue research
contracts.
Prof. Villard's radiosciences group,
which is separate from STL, will
definitely move outside the University.
Villard confirmed this yesterday but
would not discuss the alternatives. The
radiosciences department already shares
several antennas with SRI.
Petit and Rambo said yesterday that
it is "too early" for them to discuss the
negotiations underway with SRI and
others. "The SRI thing is theoretical
and can't be worked out practically
until it is known what status SRI will
have in the future," said Petit. The
Board of Trustees has announced that
SRI will be severed from the University,
but they have not announced whether it
will remain non-profit or be sold to
industry.
Ray Leadabrand, director of SRl's
Electronics and Radiosciences Division,
replied "No comment" to questions last
night on the status of the negotiations
with Stanford researchers.

working in a non-profit institution.
Frequent meetings of the entire
Systems Techniques Lab staff have
taken place since the sit-in. The debate
and uncertainty has made it "difficult
to work," according to one researcher.
There is great pressure to complete the
move from Stanford by September, he
said.
Another researcher predicted that a
group of the more "enterprising"
engineers at STL will form their own
private company with expertise in
circuit design. A much larger group of
administrators, professionals and
nonprofessionals will move to an
institute together, he predicted.
Move Is Natural
To many STL staff, a move to SRI
seems natural. "The suggestion that STL
belongs to SRI has been made for the
eight years I've been around here," said
one researcher. STL's emphasis on
applied military research has been
criticized as unsuitable in a University,
but SRI does large amounts of such
work, including electronic warfare
research very similar to some STL
contracts.
"Thee are many points which make
(an SRI) alliance attractive," said
another STL researcher. "The applied
electronics programs of SRI and STL
are in many ways complementary . . .
There has been some contact between
the two groups for many years, and
formalizing the relationships has been
mentioned in the past."
This researcher and others predicted
that most of the STL group will "stick
together in one fashion or another."
STL has much to offer SRI or any
other organization, says Rambo. "It is a
remarkably talented group. Its most
important asset is this talent, especially
to the extent that it is multiplied by the
group's cohesiveness," said Rambo. A

researcher pointed out also that STL's
contract administrators have invaluable
personal contacts with the men in the
Defense Department who issue research
contracts.
Prof. Villard's radiosciences group,
which is separate from STL, will
definitely move outside the University.
Villard confirmed this yesterday but
would not discuss the alternatives. The
radiosciences department already shares
several antennas with SRI.
Petit and Rambo said yesterday that
it is "too early" for them to discuss the
negotiations underway with SRI and
others. "The SRI thing is theoretical
and can't be worked out practically
until it is known what status SRI will
have in the future," said Petit. The
Board of Trustees has announced that
SRI will be severed from the University,
but they have not announced whether it
will remain non-profit or be sold to
industry.
Ray Leadabrand, director of SRl's
Electronics and Radiosciences Division,
replied "No comment" to questions last
night on the status of the negotiations
with Stanford researchers.
Unhappy Researchers
The departure of the research teams
reflects a general unhappiness among
many engineers with University policy.
"For 18 years I've been doing the best
job I can for the University and the
country, and now I've been kicked in
the teeth," said one AEL researcher.
"I'm a victim of the revolution."
Another researcher commented,
"People with four kids and a mortgage
had planned on working here as a life
career. Now life seems to be collapsing."
The 35 graduate students employed
on unclassified portions of the STL
program will also have to find new
work. Petit says special arrangements
will be made for students who are close
to receiving a degree and want to
continue to work with professionals in
STL when they move.
Besides Villard, Petit says he knows
of no faculty member who will leave in
direct response to the ban on classified
research. But the turmoil on campus has
had an effect, Petit said. "Many faculty
are upset. Other faculty will decide the
University is no longer a place to do
serious research or teaching."
Rambo, has been director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratories for
ten years, said he hopes to remain at
Stanford, but is not certain. "It depends
on how these other arrangements work
out," Rambo said, referring to the plans
of STL researchers to move to industry
or a non-profit institute. "I want to
make sure that the people involved in
these programs are not put at some
disadvantage," said Rambo.
In a letter May 6 to Charles
Anderson, SRI President, Rambo noted
that "program nature and staff
make-up" of the STL program "align it
to some degree with research activities
at SRI." The letter warned Anderson
against the dangers of continued
affiliation with the University.
The loss to the University from the
AEL sit-in and the ban on classified
research will include at least $500,000
yearly in overhead recovery on the lost
contracts, according to Petit. But he
expects much wider repercussions to
universities that have restricted ROTC
or classified research.
"There is a real possibility that there

will be a backlash in Washington. One
thing that might happen is that Congress
might look at the budget and say that
there is too much money going to
universities for research." said Petit.
The departure of the STL staff will
open up the entire second floor of the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL). Petit
expects a new, unclassified research
program will be developed to use the
space. The first floor and basement of
AEL contain general offices for the
entire Stanford Electronics Laboratories
and the entire Engineering School.
Since the AEL sit-in and the faculty's
ban on classified research, intensive
discussions have been underway to find
a new home for the Stanford research
teams that work on classified contracts.
The most likely new home, according
to a number of researchers, is the
Stanford Research Institute.
"Various local institutions" have
shown interest in absorbing the applied
electronics research groups, according to
a statement given the Daily by a
researcher in the Stanford Electronics
Lab (SEL). "However, serious
consideration has been given to only
one: SRI," he said.
Two separate teams within the
Stanford Electronics Lab (SEL) are
affected: the entire Systems Techniques
Lab (STL), which occupies the second
floor of the AEL building, and a
radiosciences group under Prof. O. G.
Villard.
Contracts Must Move
Seven contracts, totaling more than
$2 million, will have to be moved
outside the University, according to
Prof. William Rambo, SEL director.
More than 100 professional researchers,
nonprofessional employees, students
and faculty will be affected.
The research at AEL has included
electronic countermeasures now used by
Air Force tactical bombers. The April
3rd Movement, which led the AEL sit-in
April 9-18, demanded an end to such
work both on the campus and at SRI.
On April 24, the faculty senate
prohibited further classified contracts.
Engineering school dean John Petit
announced he would "phase out" such
work.
Besides SRI, individuals and small
groups of electronics researchers have
considered joining industrial firms in the
area or forming their own small
electronics company. But the majority
of the Systems Techniques Lab (STL) is

favorable to SRI, according to several
researchers, because they strongly prefer
working in a non-profit institution.
Frequent meetings of the entire

affiliation with the University.
The loss to the University from the
AEL sit-in and the ban on classified
research will include at least $500,000
yearly in overhead recovery on the lost
contracts, according to Petit. But he
expects much wider repercussions to
universities that have restricted ROTC
or classified research.
"There is a real possibility that there

will be a backlash in Washington. One
thing that might happen is that Congress
might look at the budget and say that
there is too much money going to
universities for research." said Petit.
The departure of the STL staff will
open up the entire second floor of the
Applied Electronics Lab (AEL). Petit
expects a new, unclassified research
program will be developed to use the
space. The first floor and basement of
AEL contain general offices for the
entire Stanford Electronics Laboratories
and the entire Engineering School.
