# DDT Use Condemned
## 
### 
The Stanford Conservation
Group's Executive Board this
week unanimously passed a
resolution urging cessation of
DDT use and passage of California
Senate Bill No. 1430.
The resolution was based on
information presented before this
group and the Stanford
Population and Environment
Forum by Dr. Charles Wurster,
director of the scientific advisory
board of the Environmental
Defense Fund, and Stewart Udall,
former Secretary of the Interior.
The resolution stated that
"over 140 million pounds of
chlorinated hydrocarbons, such as
DDT, are used in the U.S.
annually. These chemicals are
known to have a long half life,
thus preventing their rapid
breakdown. Persisting in the
environment in air and water they
contaminate other plants and
animals. Dr. Wurster recently
testified that, in fact, DDT can
create more severe insect pest
problems through selection.
Short acting, more specific
insecticides, such as carbamates,
will avoid these problems . .
