The Office of General Studies
wished to remind students that, to
date, no official changes have
been made in the current General
Studies requirements. Although
changes may be forthcoming they
will not be effective until
officially announced.
Students should note that the
Senior Colloquium requirement
will be abandoned as of
September 1, 1969. Those
intending to graduate before the
end of the Autumn quarter will be
required to have taken the
colloquim.
