# Gathering At Hoover Questions Campbell
## 
### CLAIRE DARLEY 
"I'm neither a politician nor an
orator," explained Glonn Campbell,
director of the Hoover Institution and a
Regent of the University of California,
in his opening comments to about 250
people gathered yesterday afternoon on
the Tower steps to hear his position on
Berkeley and Hoover.
In spite of his initial request for five
representatives from the crowd to come
inside and discuss, he consented to
remain and answer questions.
Questioned about the People's Park
in Berkeley, Campbell replied, "I'm not

opposed to parks nor to the people of
California." He reminded the crowd
that the city of Berkeley is planning a
new park near the disputed site.
"I stand behind the decision of the
Board of Regents that this land is the
property of the UC system. Our right
must be clearly established."
Professor Bruce Franklin of the
English Department and A3M member,
questioned Campbell about the
composition of the Board of Regents
pointing out that even though one
fourth of the population of California
consists of black, brown, and oriental
people, no representatives from these
minorities hold places on the Board.
"I'm not the person who appoints
the members," replied Campbell. "I
would hope such people will be
appointed in due course. The Governor
appoints the people he considers best
qualified."
This lead to a discussion of the
appointments of the Hoover staff—why
there are no communists.
"We don't impose political tests,"
Campbell responded. "The staff is
appointed on the basis of scholarly
qualifications."
Following the 90-minute discussion,
about 50 students gathered to burn a
fuel-soaked effigy of Campbell on the
Hoover steps.
