# Yorty Ahead
## 
### 
As the counting of returns passed the
halfway point early this morning, the
record turnout of nearly one million
voters favored two-term incumbent Sam
Yorty over Councilman Thomas
Bradley.
Returns from 1534 of 2890 precints,
including the absentees, gave Yorty
211,454, or 54 per cent, to 207,019, or
46 per cent for Bradley.
Because of the way ballots are
counted there was no way of telling
whether most of the ballots were from
Negro or white areas.
