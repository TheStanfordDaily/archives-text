# Congressional Subpoena Demands Student Records
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN 
Federal moves to halt campus
disruption hit Stanford yesterday as the
U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations subpoenaed records on
12 organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in local disorders.
The records must be presented to the
subcommittee, headed by Arkansas
Senator John McClellan, next Tuesday,
June 3, in Washington, D.C.
The University immediately began to
mobilize resources yesterday to study
the validity and scope of the subpoena,
to inform named organizations and
individuals, and to plan for presentation
of records if the subpoena cannot be
contested.
No listed names were disclosed by
the University. A top administrator
commented, however, that "the
organizations in the subpoena closely
parallels the list on the recent SRI
injunction." That list included the April
3rd Movement, SDS, Resistance, The
Peninsula Observer, Peninsula Red
Guards, Mid-Peninsula Free University,
the Committee for New Politics, and
others.

The "McClellan Committee" is
investigating campus disorder in relation
to 1968 federal legislation which
prohibits federal funding to students
convicted of disorder.
The subpoena, which was served on
Dean of Students Joel Smith yesterday
morning, calls for identification of
organization officers and,"the identity
of any other persons taking part in

disorders at Leland Stanford Junior
University, and the nature and extent of
assistance provided by any agency of
the United States Government to any
person whose name is supplied in
compliance with the terms of this
subpoena ..."
The subpoena itself lists 90
individuals evidently already identified
by the committee as taking part in
disorders.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer met
informally with his staff to discuss the
subpoena Tuesday morning.
Provost Richard W. Lyman stated
yesterday afternoon, following brief
review of the subpoena, that, "It is
important that we avoid precipitous
recations and make every effort to curb
the rumors which are bound to occur.
Apparently, none of the individuals has
been subpoenaed and, as far as we can
tell, the information requested is of a
limited scope."
Joint Meeting
Later yesterday afternoon, Lyman
sought advice from the chairman of the
academic senpte, the chairman of the
faculty advisory board (which
consideres faculty firing, hiring, and
tenure questions), the entire faculty
advisory committee on campus
disruptions, the ASSU Council of
Presidents, and the editor of The Daily.
A spot check of other major
campuses last night revealed that only
Stanford has publically revealed receipt
of a subpoena. Joel Smith reported
some other universities had been

subpoenaed but have not yet notified
the public.
The ASSU Council of President's
stated last night: "Yesterday the
university was confronted, in the form
of a Congressional subpoena, with
evidence of our country's ill-informed
gut-response to campus unrest. This
backlash is a clear assault on the
university's right to handle, its own
affairs internally and on the freedom of
students and faculty to pursue their
academic activities no matter what their
political beliefs and irresponective of
their group associations.
"The Council of Presidents and the
Editor of the Daily were invited to
participate in a joint meeting yesterday,
with faculty and members of the
administration to discuss the McClellan
subpoena. This unusual joint meeting
exemplifies the way in which the
problem should and will be addressed.
When the University's right to solve its
own problems is questioned, we as a
community must work together to
protect our sovereignty from outside
interference."
University Policy
Under existing University policy,
named students will be notified that
information concerning them has been
subpoenaed by the "McClellan
Committee."
In September, 1967, with strong
support from the faculty, Smith
established the following procedures for
dealing with student records under his
jurisdiction when they were validly
subpoenaed:
"The student involved would be
notified by letter that a sobpoena had
been received, and he would be told the
nature of the information we had been
asked to produce and who had caused
the subpoena to be issued. The student
would be advised that the subpoena
would be complied with on the due date
unless he obtained an injunction
restraining the University from
compliance. A copy of the letter to the
student would also be sent to the party
who caused the subpoena to be issued."
University records of organizations
only show the name of one
representative, not necessarily a leader,
and a statement of purpose. The name
of the representative is given to anyone
who inquires, "unless it appears that the
inquiry is spurious or that there are
special reasons to protect the individuals
identity."

Stanford lawyers began intensive
study of the subpoena yesterday to
check its validity and scope. Should the
subpoena have any constitutional or
legal loopholes, the University could
contest it in court. If the subpoena is
unquestionable, however, the University
must present the information requested.
Presentation of records could be
halted by named individuals if they
obtain a court restraining order.
Stanford will contact other
universities subpoenaed in hopes of
presenting a united front to the Senate
committee.
The "McClellan Committee" is a
subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on Government Operations. Six
Democrats and three Republicans serve
on the subcommittee. The Democrats
are: McClellan, Henry Jackson, Sam
Ervin, Edmund Muskie, Abraham
Ribicoff and Fred Harris. Republican
members are: Karl Mundt, Carl Curtis,
and Jacob Javits.
SDS Reaction
In a meeting last night, Stanford SDS
developed four demands to Pitzer
concerning the McClellan subpoena.
They demand that "(1) You tell the
McClellan Committee nothing and
provide them with none of the
information it seeks, specifically the
names of those with NDEA loans,
scholarships or grants.
"(2) Show everyone concerned the
files on them (3) Publish all
correspondence with government
agencies which are taking active roles in
the program of counterinsurgency
against the Movement and SDS
nationally. (4) You agree by Thursday
noon. Otherwise a lot is likely to
become public."
Commenting on their statement,
three SDS members said last night thai;,
"The McClellan Committee hearing to
which President Pitzer has beeh !
summoned appears to be part of a
coordinated effort to incapacitate
campus radicals over the summer and
quell campus disturbances in the fall.
Subpoenaed information may be used
by the federal government to indict
leaders and cut off financial aid to
eliminate radical presence on campuses.

"Wyman Amendment"
The "McClellan Committee"
investigation of campus disorder
stems from legislation that denies
loans, grants, and other
educational aid to students who
take part in campus riots, sit-ins,
seizures, and other disruptions.
The legislation, presented in
1968 by New Hampshire
Republican Congressman Louis
Wyman, could affect 1.4 million
students and more than $1 billion
in federal educational aid.
Wyman's restrictions were in the
form of amendments to the
National Science Foundation's
(NSF) money bill for fiscal 1969
and an authorization bill
extending higher education
programs for two years.

The subpoena itself lists 90
individuals evidently already identified
by the committee as taking part in
disorders.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer met
informally with his staff to discuss the
subpoena Tuesday morning.
Provost Richard W. Lyman stated
yesterday afternoon, following brief
review of the subpoena, that, "It is
important that we avoid precipitous
recations and make every effort to curb
the rumors which are bound to occur.
Apparently, none of the individuals has
been subpoenaed and, as far as we can
tell, the information requested is of a
limited scope."
Joint Meeting
Later yesterday afternoon, Lyman
sought advice from the chairman of the
academic senpte, the chairman of the
faculty advisory board (which
consideres faculty firing, hiring, and
tenure questions), the entire faculty
advisory committee on campus
disruptions, the ASSU Council of
Presidents, and the editor of The Daily.
A spot check of other major
campuses last night revealed that only
Stanford has publically revealed receipt
of a subpoena. Joel Smith reported
some other universities had been

subpoenaed but have not yet notified
the public.
The ASSU Council of President's
stated last night: "Yesterday the
university was confronted, in the form
of a Congressional subpoena, with
evidence of our country's ill-informed
gut-response to campus unrest. This
backlash is a clear assault on the
university's right to handle, its own
affairs internally and on the freedom of
students and faculty to pursue their
academic activities no matter what their
political beliefs and irresponective of
their group associations.
"The Council of Presidents and the
Editor of the Daily were invited to
participate in a joint meeting yesterday,
with faculty and members of the
administration to discuss the McClellan
subpoena. This unusual joint meeting
exemplifies the way in which the
problem should and will be addressed.
When the University's right to solve its
own problems is questioned, we as a
community must work together to
protect our sovereignty from outside
interference."
University Policy
Under existing University policy,
named students will be notified that
information concerning them has been
subpoenaed by the "McClellan
Committee."
In September, 1967, with strong
support from the faculty, Smith
established the following procedures for
dealing with student records under his
jurisdiction when they were validly
subpoenaed:
"The student involved would be
notified by letter that a sobpoena had
been received, and he would be told the
nature of the information we had been
asked to produce and who had caused
the subpoena to be issued. The student
would be advised that the subpoena
would be complied with on the due date
unless he obtained an injunction
restraining the University from
compliance. A copy of the letter to the
student would also be sent to the party
who caused the subpoena to be issued."
University records of organizations
only show the name of one
representative, not necessarily a leader,
and a statement of purpose. The name
of the representative is given to anyone
who inquires, "unless it appears that the
inquiry is spurious or that there are
special reasons to protect the individuals
identity."

Stanford lawyers began intensive
study of the subpoena yesterday to
check its validity and scope. Should the
subpoena have any constitutional or
legal loopholes, the University could
contest it in court. If the subpoena is
unquestionable, however, the University
must present the information requested.
Presentation of records could be
halted by named individuals if they
obtain a court restraining order.
Stanford will contact other
universities subpoenaed in hopes of
presenting a united front to the Senate
committee.
The "McClellan Committee" is a
subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on Government Operations. Six
Democrats and three Republicans serve
on the subcommittee. The Democrats
are: McClellan, Henry Jackson, Sam
Ervin, Edmund Muskie, Abraham
Ribicoff and Fred Harris. Republican
members are: Karl Mundt, Carl Curtis,
and Jacob Javits.
SDS Reaction
In a meeting last night, Stanford SDS
developed four demands to Pitzer
concerning the McClellan subpoena.
They demand that "(1) You tell the
McClellan Committee nothing and
provide them with none of the
information it seeks, specifically the
names of those with NDEA loans,
scholarships or grants.
"(2) Show everyone concerned the
files on them (3) Publish all
correspondence with government
agencies which are taking active roles in
the program of counterinsurgency
against the Movement and SDS
nationally. (4) You agree by Thursday
noon. Otherwise a lot is likely to
become public."
Commenting on their statement,
three SDS members said last night thai;,
"The McClellan Committee hearing to
which President Pitzer has beeh !
summoned appears to be part of a
coordinated effort to incapacitate
campus radicals over the summer and
quell campus disturbances in the fall.
Subpoenaed information may be used
by the federal government to indict
leaders and cut off financial aid to
eliminate radical presence on campuses.
*'As the past year at Stanford has
demonstrated, the main function of
radical disruptions is to make the public
aware of important issues and bring
about significant policy changes,
such as the elimination of
classified research at Stanford.
*Vor example, it was the highly
unpopular disruption of the Jan.
14 Trustees meeting that
precipitated the March 1 1 open
forum and eventually the April
3rd Movement's fight to retain
SRI and end counterinsurgency.
The actions of the McClellan
Committee can only serve to
protect the Trustee's power by
stifling political controversy on
campus."
"Wyman Amendment"
The "McClellan Committee"
investigation of campus disorder
stems from legislation that denies
loans, grants, and other
educational aid to students who
take part in campus riots, sit-ins,
seizures, and other disruptions.
The legislation, presented in
1968 by New Hampshire
Republican Congressman Louis
Wyman, could affect 1.4 million
students and more than $1 billion
in federal educational aid.
Wyman's restrictions were in the
form of amendments to the
National Science Foundation's
(NSF) money bill for fiscal 1969
and an authorization bill
extending higher education
programs for two years.
Federal moves to halt campus
disruption hit Stanford yesterday as the
U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations subpoenaed records on
12 organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in local disorders.
The records must be presented to the
subcommittee, headed by Arkansas
Senator John McClellan, next Tuesday,
June 3, in Washington, D.C.
The University immediately began to
mobilize resources yesterday to study
the validity and scope of the subpoena,
to inform named organizations and
individuals, and to plan for presentation
of records if the subpoena cannot be
contested.
No listed names were disclosed by
the University. A top administrator
commented, however, that "the
organizations in the subpoena closely
parallels the list on the recent SRI
injunction." That list included the April
3rd Movement, SDS, Resistance, The
Peninsula Observer, Peninsula Red
Guards, Mid-Peninsula Free University,
the Committee for New Politics, and
others.

their group associations.
"The Council of Presidents and the
Editor of the Daily were invited to
participate in a joint meeting yesterday,
with faculty and members of the
administration to discuss the McClellan
subpoena. This unusual joint meeting
exemplifies the way in which the
problem should and will be addressed.
When the University's right to solve its
own problems is questioned, we as a
community must work together to
protect our sovereignty from outside
interference."
University Policy
Under existing University policy,
named students will be notified that
information concerning them has been
subpoenaed by the "McClellan
Committee."
In September, 1967, with strong
support from the faculty, Smith
established the following procedures for
dealing with student records under his
jurisdiction when they were validly
subpoenaed:
"The student involved would be
notified by letter that a sobpoena had
been received, and he would be told the
nature of the information we had been
asked to produce and who had caused
the subpoena to be issued. The student
would be advised that the subpoena
would be complied with on the due date
unless he obtained an injunction
restraining the University from
compliance. A copy of the letter to the
student would also be sent to the party
who caused the subpoena to be issued."
University records of organizations
only show the name of one
representative, not necessarily a leader,
and a statement of purpose. The name
of the representative is given to anyone
who inquires, "unless it appears that the
inquiry is spurious or that there are
special reasons to protect the individuals
identity."

Stanford lawyers began intensive
study of the subpoena yesterday to
check its validity and scope. Should the
subpoena have any constitutional or
legal loopholes, the University could
contest it in court. If the subpoena is
unquestionable, however, the University
must present the information requested.
Presentation of records could be
halted by named individuals if they
obtain a court restraining order.
Stanford will contact other
universities subpoenaed in hopes of
presenting a united front to the Senate
committee.
The "McClellan Committee" is a
subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on Government Operations. Six
Democrats and three Republicans serve
on the subcommittee. The Democrats
are: McClellan, Henry Jackson, Sam
Ervin, Edmund Muskie, Abraham
Ribicoff and Fred Harris. Republican
members are: Karl Mundt, Carl Curtis,
and Jacob Javits.
SDS Reaction
In a meeting last night, Stanford SDS
developed four demands to Pitzer
concerning the McClellan subpoena.
They demand that "(1) You tell the
McClellan Committee nothing and
provide them with none of the
information it seeks, specifically the
names of those with NDEA loans,
scholarships or grants.
"(2) Show everyone concerned the
files on them (3) Publish all
correspondence with government
agencies which are taking active roles in
the program of counterinsurgency
against the Movement and SDS
nationally. (4) You agree by Thursday
noon. Otherwise a lot is likely to
become public."
Commenting on their statement,
three SDS members said last night thai;,
"The McClellan Committee hearing to
which President Pitzer has beeh !
summoned appears to be part of a
coordinated effort to incapacitate
campus radicals over the summer and
quell campus disturbances in the fall.
Subpoenaed information may be used
by the federal government to indict
leaders and cut off financial aid to
eliminate radical presence on campuses.
*'As the past year at Stanford has
demonstrated, the main function of
radical disruptions is to make the public
aware of important issues and bring
about significant policy changes,
such as the elimination of
classified research at Stanford.
*Vor example, it was the highly
unpopular disruption of the Jan.
14 Trustees meeting that
precipitated the March 1 1 open
forum and eventually the April
3rd Movement's fight to retain
SRI and end counterinsurgency.
The actions of the McClellan
Committee can only serve to
protect the Trustee's power by
stifling political controversy on
campus."
"Wyman Amendment"
The "McClellan Committee"
investigation of campus disorder
stems from legislation that denies
loans, grants, and other
educational aid to students who
take part in campus riots, sit-ins,
seizures, and other disruptions.
The legislation, presented in
1968 by New Hampshire
Republican Congressman Louis
Wyman, could affect 1.4 million
students and more than $1 billion
in federal educational aid.
Wyman's restrictions were in the
form of amendments to the
National Science Foundation's
(NSF) money bill for fiscal 1969
and an authorization bill
extending higher education
programs for two years.
Federal moves to halt campus
disruption hit Stanford yesterday as the
U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations subpoenaed records on
12 organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in local disorders.
The records must be presented to the
subcommittee, headed by Arkansas
Senator John McClellan, next Tuesday,
June 3, in Washington, D.C.
The University immediately began to
mobilize resources yesterday to study
the validity and scope of the subpoena,
to inform named organizations and
individuals, and to plan for presentation
of records if the subpoena cannot be
contested.
No listed names were disclosed by
the University. A top administrator
commented, however, that "the
organizations in the subpoena closely
parallels the list on the recent SRI
injunction." That list included the April
3rd Movement, SDS, Resistance, The
Peninsula Observer, Peninsula Red
Guards, Mid-Peninsula Free University,
the Committee for New Politics, and
others.
I ; unil Cutback
The "McClellan Committee" is
investigating campus disorder in relation
to 1968 federal legislation which
prohibits federal funding to students
convicted of disorder.
The subpoena, which was served on
Dean of Students Joel Smith yesterday
morning, calls for identification of
organization officers and,"the identity
of any other persons taking part in

disorders at Leland Stanford Junior
University, and the nature and extent of
assistance provided by any agency of
the United States Government to any
person whose name is supplied in
compliance with the terms of this
subpoena ..."
The subpoena itself lists 90
individuals evidently already identified
by the committee as taking part in
disorders.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer met
informally with his staff to discuss the
subpoena Tuesday morning.
Provost Richard W. Lyman stated
yesterday afternoon, following brief
review of the subpoena, that, "It is
important that we avoid precipitous
recations and make every effort to curb
the rumors which are bound to occur.
Apparently, none of the individuals has
been subpoenaed and, as far as we can
tell, the information requested is of a
limited scope."
Joint Meeting
Later yesterday afternoon, Lyman
sought advice from the chairman of the
academic senpte, the chairman of the
faculty advisory board (which
consideres faculty firing, hiring, and
tenure questions), the entire faculty
advisory committee on campus
disruptions, the ASSU Council of
Presidents, and the editor of The Daily.
A spot check of other major
campuses last night revealed that only
Stanford has publically revealed receipt
of a subpoena. Joel Smith reported
some other universities had been

subpoenaed but have not yet notified
the public.
The ASSU Council of President's
stated last night: "Yesterday the
university was confronted, in the form
of a Congressional subpoena, with
evidence of our country's ill-informed
gut-response to campus unrest. This
backlash is a clear assault on the
university's right to handle, its own
affairs internally and on the freedom of
students and faculty to pursue their
academic activities no matter what their
political beliefs and irresponective of
their group associations.

special reasons to protect the individuals
identity."

Stanford lawyers began intensive
study of the subpoena yesterday to
check its validity and scope. Should the
subpoena have any constitutional or
legal loopholes, the University could
contest it in court. If the subpoena is
unquestionable, however, the University
must present the information requested.
Presentation of records could be
halted by named individuals if they
obtain a court restraining order.
Stanford will contact other
universities subpoenaed in hopes of
presenting a united front to the Senate
committee.
The "McClellan Committee" is a
subcommittee of the Senate Committee
on Government Operations. Six
Democrats and three Republicans serve
on the subcommittee. The Democrats
are: McClellan, Henry Jackson, Sam
Ervin, Edmund Muskie, Abraham
Ribicoff and Fred Harris. Republican
members are: Karl Mundt, Carl Curtis,
and Jacob Javits.
SDS Reaction
In a meeting last night, Stanford SDS
developed four demands to Pitzer
concerning the McClellan subpoena.
They demand that "(1) You tell the
McClellan Committee nothing and
provide them with none of the
information it seeks, specifically the
names of those with NDEA loans,
scholarships or grants.
"(2) Show everyone concerned the
files on them (3) Publish all
correspondence with government
agencies which are taking active roles in
the program of counterinsurgency
against the Movement and SDS
nationally. (4) You agree by Thursday
noon. Otherwise a lot is likely to
become public."
Commenting on their statement,
three SDS members said last night thai;,
"The McClellan Committee hearing to
which President Pitzer has beeh !
summoned appears to be part of a
coordinated effort to incapacitate
campus radicals over the summer and
quell campus disturbances in the fall.
Subpoenaed information may be used
by the federal government to indict
leaders and cut off financial aid to
eliminate radical presence on campuses.
*'As the past year at Stanford has
demonstrated, the main function of
radical disruptions is to make the public
aware of important issues and bring
about significant policy changes,
such as the elimination of
classified research at Stanford.
*Vor example, it was the highly
unpopular disruption of the Jan.
14 Trustees meeting that
precipitated the March 1 1 open
forum and eventually the April
3rd Movement's fight to retain
SRI and end counterinsurgency.
The actions of the McClellan
Committee can only serve to
protect the Trustee's power by
stifling political controversy on
campus."
"Wyman Amendment"
The "McClellan Committee"
investigation of campus disorder
stems from legislation that denies
loans, grants, and other
educational aid to students who
take part in campus riots, sit-ins,
seizures, and other disruptions.
The legislation, presented in
1968 by New Hampshire
Republican Congressman Louis
Wyman, could affect 1.4 million
students and more than $1 billion
in federal educational aid.
Wyman's restrictions were in the
form of amendments to the
National Science Foundation's
(NSF) money bill for fiscal 1969
and an authorization bill
extending higher education
programs for two years.
Federal moves to halt campus
disruption hit Stanford yesterday as the
U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations subpoenaed records on
12 organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in local disorders.
The records must be presented to the
subcommittee, headed by Arkansas
Senator John McClellan, next Tuesday,
June 3, in Washington, D.C.
The University immediately began to
mobilize resources yesterday to study
the validity and scope of the subpoena,
to inform named organizations and
individuals, and to plan for presentation
of records if the subpoena cannot be
contested.
No listed names were disclosed by
the University. A top administrator
commented, however, that "the
organizations in the subpoena closely
parallels the list on the recent SRI
injunction." That list included the April
3rd Movement, SDS, Resistance, The
Peninsula Observer, Peninsula Red
Guards, Mid-Peninsula Free University,
the Committee for New Politics, and
others.
I ; unil Cutback
The "McClellan Committee" is
investigating campus disorder in relation
to 1968 federal legislation which
prohibits federal funding to students
convicted of disorder.
The subpoena, which was served on
Dean of Students Joel Smith yesterday
morning, calls for identification of
organization officers and,"the identity
of any other persons taking part in

disorders at Leland Stanford Junior
University, and the nature and extent of
assistance provided by any agency of
the United States Government to any
person whose name is supplied in
compliance with the terms of this
subpoena ..."
The subpoena itself lists 90
individuals evidently already identified
by the committee as taking part in
disorders.
President Kenneth S. Pitzer met
informally with his staff to discuss the
subpoena Tuesday morning.
Provost Richard W. Lyman stated
yesterday afternoon, following brief
review of the subpoena, that, "It is
important that we avoid precipitous
recations and make every effort to curb
the rumors which are bound to occur.
Apparently, none of the individuals has
been subpoenaed and, as far as we can
tell, the information requested is of a
limited scope."
Joint Meeting
Later yesterday afternoon, Lyman
sought advice from the chairman of the
academic senpte, the chairman of the
faculty advisory board (which
consideres faculty firing, hiring, and
tenure questions), the entire faculty
advisory committee on campus
disruptions, the ASSU Council of
Presidents, and the editor of The Daily.
A spot check of other major
campuses last night revealed that only
Stanford has publically revealed receipt
of a subpoena. Joel Smith reported
some other universities had been

subpoenaed but have not yet notified
the public.
The ASSU Council of President's
stated last night: "Yesterday the
university was confronted, in the form
of a Congressional subpoena, with
evidence of our country's ill-informed
gut-response to campus unrest. This
backlash is a clear assault on the
university's right to handle, its own
affairs internally and on the freedom of
students and faculty to pursue their
academic activities no matter what their
political beliefs and irresponective of
their group associations.
"The Council of Presidents and the
Editor of the Daily were invited to
participate in a joint meeting yesterday,
with faculty and members of the
administration to discuss the McClellan
subpoena. This unusual joint meeting
exemplifies the way in which the
problem should and will be addressed.
When the University's right to solve its
own problems is questioned, we as a
community must work together to
protect our sovereignty from outside
interference."
University Policy
Under existing University policy,
named students will be notified that
information concerning them has been
subpoenaed by the "McClellan
Committee."
In September, 1967, with strong
support from the faculty, Smith
established the following procedures for
dealing with student records under his
jurisdiction when they were validly
subpoenaed:
"The student involved would be
notified by letter that a sobpoena had
been received, and he would be told the
nature of the information we had been
asked to produce and who had caused
the subpoena to be issued. The student
would be advised that the subpoena
would be complied with on the due date
unless he obtained an injunction
restraining the University from
compliance. A copy of the letter to the
student would also be sent to the party
who caused the subpoena to be issued."
University records of organizations
only show the name of one
representative, not necessarily a leader,
and a statement of purpose. The name
of the representative is given to anyone
who inquires, "unless it appears that the
inquiry is spurious or that there are
special reasons to protect the individuals
identity."
