# SJC Convicts Four, Acquits Two In Encina Hall Sit-In Hearings
## 
### FRANK MILLER 
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
acquitted two students and convicted
four others who were alledgedly
involved in the Encina Hall sit-in of May
1, it was announced yesterday. These
decisions only represent those made
over the past two days.
One of the students found to be not
guilty, Alan Rader, was acquitted for
lack of sufficient evidence. He is a
graduate student in the law school.
T e names of the other individuals
who were sentenced are being with-held
by the SJC until President Pitzer can
sign the recommendations of the
Council. He is waiting to sign because a
dissenting opinion is being written.
According to Jack Friedenthal, law
professor and chairman of the SJC,
states that the Council has
recommended punishments "generally

in line with those meted out to other
people found guilty."
There was speculation with Rader's
acquittal that the SJC would drop
proceedings against students in cases
where the only evidence is a photograph
of them on the steps of Encina Hall.
However, Friedenthal denied that cases
would be dropped and indicated that
"each case would be judged on its own
grounds." He did say that there would
be acquittals where there is a reasonable
doubt as to the individual's guilt.
Hearings for Rader and one other
individual who was convicted were held
last Friday, and the Council was divided
in both cases. Reportedly, the vote in
Rader's acquittal was 5 for acquittal, 1
for finding him guilty, and one
abstention; in convicted person's case it
was 5 for finding him guilty and two for
acquittal.

Other hearings have been held this
week and more are scheduled for those
of the more than seventy suspended
students who have requested hearings.
Thirty-five students have signed up for
the "motivational" hearing scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon regarding the
reasons for being in Encina on May 1.
In their hearings last Friday, both the
convicted student and Rader took
similar approaches. Neither had
witnesses testify in his behalf and
neither testified on his own behalf.
Their defense consisted of
cross-examination of administration
witnesses and arguments for acquittal
by the defense counsel.
Rader's counsel argued that a picture
of Rader on the steps of Encina Hall
the only evidence was not sufficient to
convict Rader of being in the building
beyond a reasonable doubt. The only
other evidence linking Rader to being
inside the building was a statement by
Stephen Kline, professor of Mechanical
Engineering, that he saw Rader inside.
However, Kline admitted that it was
"possible" that he was wrong and did
not actually see Rader.
The Council evidently felt that
Kline's statement was unreliable and
agreed that a picture of someone on the
steps of Encina Hall was not conclusive
evidence to prove that he had been
inside the building.
The convicted person's counsel
argued that there was a distinct
possibility that a number of people had
not heard the announcement to leave
the building and that the announcement
made throughout the building was an
order to leave the building under threat
of suspension and not an announcement
that students were in violation of the
campus policy on demonstrations.
Counsel also argued that there was
no evidence that the client was actually
in the building after 6:00 a.m.
Rader's counsel contended that
Friedenthal's statement was unfair that
cooperation with the S.IC would have
some influence on the recommended
punishments.

be acquittals where there is a reasonable
doubt as to the individual's guilt.
Hearings for Rader and one other
individual who was convicted were held
last Friday, and the Council was divided
in both cases. Reportedly, the vote in
Rader's acquittal was 5 for acquittal, 1
for finding him guilty, and one
abstention; in convicted person's case it
was 5 for finding him guilty and two for
acquittal.

Other hearings have been held this
week and more are scheduled for those
of the more than seventy suspended
students who have requested hearings.
Thirty-five students have signed up for
the "motivational" hearing scheduled
for tomorrow afternoon regarding the
reasons for being in Encina on May 1.
In their hearings last Friday, both the
convicted student and Rader took
similar approaches. Neither had
witnesses testify in his behalf and
neither testified on his own behalf.
Their defense consisted of
cross-examination of administration
witnesses and arguments for acquittal
by the defense counsel.
Rader's counsel argued that a picture
of Rader on the steps of Encina Hall
the only evidence was not sufficient to
convict Rader of being in the building
beyond a reasonable doubt. The only
other evidence linking Rader to being
inside the building was a statement by
Stephen Kline, professor of Mechanical
Engineering, that he saw Rader inside.
However, Kline admitted that it was
"possible" that he was wrong and did
not actually see Rader.
The Council evidently felt that
Kline's statement was unreliable and
agreed that a picture of someone on the
steps of Encina Hall was not conclusive
evidence to prove that he had been
inside the building.
The convicted person's counsel
argued that there was a distinct
possibility that a number of people had
not heard the announcement to leave
the building and that the announcement
made throughout the building was an
order to leave the building under threat
of suspension and not an announcement
that students were in violation of the
campus policy on demonstrations.
Counsel also argued that there was
no evidence that the client was actually
in the building after 6:00 a.m.
Rader's counsel contended that
Friedenthal's statement was unfair that
cooperation with the S.IC would have
some influence on the recommended
punishments.
The Stanford Judicial Council (SJC)
acquitted two students and convicted
four others who were alledgedly
involved in the Encina Hall sit-in of May
1, it was announced yesterday. These
decisions only represent those made
over the past two days.
One of the students found to be not
guilty, Alan Rader, was acquitted for
lack of sufficient evidence. He is a
graduate student in the law school.
T e names of the other individuals
who were sentenced are being with-held
by the SJC until President Pitzer can
sign the recommendations of the
Council. He is waiting to sign because a
dissenting opinion is being written.
According to Jack Friedenthal, law
professor and chairman of the SJC,
states that the Council has
recommended punishments "generally

in line with those meted out to other
people found guilty."
There was speculation with Rader's
acquittal that the SJC would drop
proceedings against students in cases
where the only evidence is a photograph
of them on the steps of Encina Hall.
However, Friedenthal denied that cases
would be dropped and indicated that
"each case would be judged on its own
grounds." He did say that there would
be acquittals where there is a reasonable
doubt as to the individual's guilt.
