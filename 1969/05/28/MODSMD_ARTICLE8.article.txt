# Federal Fund Cuts Stall Student Loans
## 
### BROOKE SHEARER 
Funds from the federal government
make-up the major source of financial
aid available to undergraduate students
enrolled at Stanford University, but 450
qualified students will not be able to get
them next year unless grants now
authorized are appropriated by
Congress.
"Up until this year," said Stanford
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff,
"we have generally gotten what we
asked for. We built up these aid
programs and encouraged students to
apply. Now the money is not available."
This year, the federal Educational
Opportunity Grant Program (EOG)
provided $140,000 in gift aid to
students. The University originally
sought $206,350 with the objective of
aiding 331 undergraduates. Due to the
cuts about 60 entering students who
would have received initial year grants
cannot be funded and the grants of all
current recipients which were to be
increased from $800 to $1000 are likely
to be frozen.
The National Defense Student Loan
Program made it possible for Stanford
students to borrow $1.4 million, about
78 percent of our total loan program.
Next year's funds fall $200,000 short
and it is estimated that 200 fewer
borrowers can be aided.
The third major source of student
funds is the College Work-Study
Program (CWS). It provided $204,000

in employment income out of the total
$3.7 million earned by students from
on-campus employment. It seems that
next year Stanford will get only
$125,000, and the University will be
able to employ 190 students, whereas
they had hoped to give jobs to 400.
Not only are these funds a major
portion of our total financial aid
program, but since they are directed
primarily at students from low-income
families they make it possible for
students who would otherwise be
unable to get an education to attend
Stanford.
According to Huff, "California has
been hit particularly hard. Money now
in prospect for the state can cover only
one-half the identified need for
work-study students, two-thirds of the
federal loan fund demand, and
four-fifths of those qualified for
first-year educational opportunity
grants."
"We encourage people to get a note
off to Congress," he added. "We are
hopeful that a lot of letters pointing out
the importance of the programs to
specific individuals will have an effect.
We still hope to get relief from a
supplimentary appropriation
Huff commented that he viewed the
federal government's funding cuts as an
economic measure designed to balance
the budget, but he added, "I don't think
the occurances on college campuses are
helping the situation.

work-study students, two-thirds of the
federal loan fund demand, and
four-fifths of those qualified for
first-year educational opportunity
grants."
"We encourage people to get a note
off to Congress," he added. "We are
hopeful that a lot of letters pointing out
the importance of the programs to
specific individuals will have an effect.
We still hope to get relief from a
supplimentary appropriation
Huff commented that he viewed the
federal government's funding cuts as an
economic measure designed to balance
the budget, but he added, "I don't think
the occurances on college campuses are
helping the situation.
Funds from the federal government
make-up the major source of financial
aid available to undergraduate students
enrolled at Stanford University, but 450
qualified students will not be able to get
them next year unless grants now
authorized are appropriated by
Congress.
"Up until this year," said Stanford
Financial Aids Director Robert Huff,
"we have generally gotten what we
asked for. We built up these aid
programs and encouraged students to
apply. Now the money is not available."
This year, the federal Educational
Opportunity Grant Program (EOG)
provided $140,000 in gift aid to
students. The University originally
sought $206,350 with the objective of
aiding 331 undergraduates. Due to the
cuts about 60 entering students who
would have received initial year grants
cannot be funded and the grants of all
current recipients which were to be
increased from $800 to $1000 are likely
to be frozen.
The National Defense Student Loan
Program made it possible for Stanford
students to borrow $1.4 million, about
78 percent of our total loan program.
Next year's funds fall $200,000 short
and it is estimated that 200 fewer
borrowers can be aided.
The third major source of student
funds is the College Work-Study
Program (CWS). It provided $204,000

in employment income out of the total
$3.7 million earned by students from
on-campus employment. It seems that
next year Stanford will get only
$125,000, and the University will be
able to employ 190 students, whereas
they had hoped to give jobs to 400.
Not only are these funds a major
portion of our total financial aid
program, but since they are directed
primarily at students from low-income
families they make it possible for
students who would otherwise be
unable to get an education to attend
Stanford.
According to Huff, "California has
been hit particularly hard. Money now
in prospect for the state can cover only
one-half the identified need for
work-study students, two-thirds of the
federal loan fund demand, and
four-fifths of those qualified for
first-year educational opportunity
grants."
