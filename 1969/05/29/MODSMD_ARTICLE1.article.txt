# Faculty Plans All-Day Vigil, Talks, March
## Memorial Day Event Sponsored By 46 Faculty 
### 
Stanford faculty have
announced the schedule for a
Memorial Day"Day of Turning"â€”a
sunrise to sunset program of
education, discussion and planning.
Organized by 46 professors, the
day is meant as a time to "recover
our sense of direction, to channel
the moral outrage we feel, to
reestablish priorities for the
future."
The morning program, beginning
at 6:00 a.m. at Memorial Church,
will consist of informal discussion
and a general meeting on how to
organize the Stanford community
and what to do about the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
A wreath will be laid in the
Inner Quad at 10:00 a.m. "to
commemorate the dead and to
acknowledge our complicity in
their deaths."
At 10:30 a.m. there will be a
march to the Page Mill Road
industrial complex for the laying of
a second wreath.
The group will regather at the
Church between 12:00 and 1:00
p.m. for films and discussions on
the crucial issues concerning U.S.
involvement in Vietnam and in
Southeast Asia.
The remainder of the day will
involve discussions led by
prominent Bay area leaders and will
focus on alternatives to present
goals and priorities.
Speakers between 1:30 and 4:00
p.m. will be Carleton Goodlett on
the Black Community, the
University and the War; Robert
Arnold, Senior Economist at SRI,
on Economic Reconversion to
Peace; Mrs. Rhoda Kaufman on
Berkeley; David Harris on the
Draft; Pat Shea on the Governance
of the University.
Between 4:00 and 6:00 p.m.,
there will be small group
discussions on the topics above and
several others.
After a summing up discussion
on how to organize and the
prospects for action, there will be a
communal meal at 6:30 p.m. at the
outdoor fountain behind the
Church.
