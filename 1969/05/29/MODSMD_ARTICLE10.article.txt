# McClellan Subpoena Is Studied
## Lyman Answers Questions Before Student Legislature 
### 
Universities probably are in for
"several seasons" of Congressional
investigations, Provost Richard W.
Lyman of Stanford told the
Student Legislature Wednesday
night.
Cornell, Harvard, and Berkeley
are among the universities which
have received similar notice from
the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations,
headed by Senator John McClellan,
Arkansas Democrat.
The Stanford subpoena calls for
University records on 12
organizations and 90 named
individuals. Under existing campus
rules, all those named are being sent
letters informing them that the
University intends to comply with
the June 3 date specified by the
Subcommittee unless the
individuals concerned obtain an
injunction restraining the
University from this action.
Lyman said the Subcommittee
made no statement on criteria used
in selecting the 90 names, although
most appear to have come from
public records, such as court
documents and newspaper
accounts.
Possible Errors
The University has not made the
names public because the list
appears to have several errors, he
indicated. Several of the
organizations named have no
formal relationship with the
University and information on
others is "very sparse," he added.
While the language of the
subpoena is still being studied by
legal counsel, Lyman said he
personally had no reason to believe
it would be used by the University
as a "carpet sweeper" to pick up
anyone "suspected of harboring
dangerous thoughts."
One possible purpose for the
Senate probe is to see if universities
have complied with various "riders"
on appropriations bills barring
federal aid to those found guilty in
court or in campus proceedings of
disruptive activities, he noted.
To date, Lyman said, he was
not aware that federal funds has
been withdrawn from any
Stanford student under these
provisions. No students have been
convicted in court for disruptive
activities in campus and the
number so far found guilty in
campus proceedings who are still
enrolled as students is relatively
small.
Pitzer Statement
In a statement to the Stanford
community, University President
Kenneth S. Pitzer said: "For the
University to disobey a lawful
order of a governmental body
would be to turn our backs on the
very standards by which we are
attempting to govern ourselves.
"Our obligation to abide by
the law would be identical even if
we did not receive a penny from
the government.
"Equally heavy would be our
obligation to challenge, within the
means provided by law, any
action by the government
involving the University which
might be invalid. That is why I
have asked legal counsel to
examine the subpoena . . .
"We cannot guide ourselves by
the rule of law and deny that rule
when it suits us in our relations
with others. The University will
not do that, and I am confident
that the University community
will not ask it to.
Responding to questions,
Lyman said he felt it would be a
"dubious" tactic to flood the
subcommittee with extraneous
information beyond that covered
by the subpoena. The
investigating group probably will
sift the information it receives to
determine what is relevant to its
objectives.
At the same time, he pointed
out, the University does not have
"vast dossiers" on individuals and
noted that so far as he knows no
person from Stanford has yet
been subpoenaed to testify before

the subcommittee. He did nut rule
this out as a future possibility,
however.
Urging a level headed approach
to the future, he noted that the
House Internal Security
Committee—formerly HUAC —has
announced plans for a study of
student unrest and added: "a
good many committees can do
this within the terms of their
enabling legislation."
Student Reply
Jeff Kane, contacted last night
in Bill Black's absence, informed
The Daily that he for one would be
back at Stanford next year. The
popular red-headed rabble rouser
explained it this way to a
sympathetic night editor:
It appears that McClellan's
action is an attempt by the federal
government to regulate the
internal affairs of a private
university. The maintenance of
order in the University is the
University's responsibility, as it is
the University's responsibility to
determine its policies regarding
tenure, its curriculum, its guest
speakers, and the selection 01 its
officers.
The subpoena is overly broad
and should be challenged in court
by the University. But what
constitutes a disorder? On some
campuses, for instance, the
distribution of leaflets though
an exercise of free speech—may be
construed as a disruption. Also,
who determines whether a
disruption occured? The
University President? A campus
judiciary? A concerned student?
Such a determination should be
made by a court of general
jurisdiction.
''Furthermore, the federal
government is in full knowledge
of what students are receiving
federal funds. Yet the subpoena
applies to everyone engaged in
disorders, regardless of financial
status. This action exceeds federal
authority and must be challenged?

tenure, its curriculum, its guest
speakers, and the selection 01 its
officers.
The subpoena is overly broad
and should be challenged in court
by the University. But what
constitutes a disorder? On some
campuses, for instance, the
distribution of leaflets though
an exercise of free speech—may be
construed as a disruption. Also,
who determines whether a
disruption occured? The
University President? A campus
judiciary? A concerned student?
Such a determination should be
made by a court of general
jurisdiction.
''Furthermore, the federal
government is in full knowledge
of what students are receiving
federal funds. Yet the subpoena
applies to everyone engaged in
disorders, regardless of financial
status. This action exceeds federal
authority and must be challenged?
Universities probably are in for
"several seasons" of Congressional
investigations, Provost Richard W.
Lyman of Stanford told the
Student Legislature Wednesday
night.
Cornell, Harvard, and Berkeley
are among the universities which
have received similar notice from
the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations,
headed by Senator John McClellan,
Arkansas Democrat.
The Stanford subpoena calls for
University records on 12
organizations and 90 named
individuals. Under existing campus
rules, all those named are being sent
letters informing them that the
University intends to comply with
the June 3 date specified by the
Subcommittee unless the
individuals concerned obtain an
injunction restraining the
University from this action.
Lyman said the Subcommittee
made no statement on criteria used
in selecting the 90 names, although
most appear to have come from
public records, such as court
documents and newspaper
accounts.
Possible Errors
The University has not made the
names public because the list
appears to have several errors, he
indicated. Several of the
organizations named have no
formal relationship with the
University and information on
others is "very sparse," he added.
While the language of the
subpoena is still being studied by
legal counsel, Lyman said he
personally had no reason to believe
it would be used by the University
as a "carpet sweeper" to pick up
anyone "suspected of harboring
dangerous thoughts."
One possible purpose for the
Senate probe is to see if universities
have complied with various "riders"
on appropriations bills barring
federal aid to those found guilty in
court or in campus proceedings of
disruptive activities, he noted.
To date, Lyman said, he was
not aware that federal funds has
been withdrawn from any
Stanford student under these
provisions. No students have been
convicted in court for disruptive
activities in campus and the
number so far found guilty in
campus proceedings who are still
enrolled as students is relatively
small.
Pitzer Statement
In a statement to the Stanford
community, University President
Kenneth S. Pitzer said: "For the
University to disobey a lawful
order of a governmental body
would be to turn our backs on the
very standards by which we are
attempting to govern ourselves.
"Our obligation to abide by
the law would be identical even if
we did not receive a penny from
the government.
"Equally heavy would be our
obligation to challenge, within the
means provided by law, any
action by the government
involving the University which
might be invalid. That is why I
have asked legal counsel to
examine the subpoena . . .
"We cannot guide ourselves by
the rule of law and deny that rule
when it suits us in our relations
with others. The University will
not do that, and I am confident
that the University community
will not ask it to.
Responding to questions,
Lyman said he felt it would be a
"dubious" tactic to flood the
subcommittee with extraneous
information beyond that covered
by the subpoena. The
investigating group probably will
sift the information it receives to
determine what is relevant to its
objectives.
At the same time, he pointed
out, the University does not have
"vast dossiers" on individuals and
noted that so far as he knows no
person from Stanford has yet
been subpoenaed to testify before

the subcommittee. He did nut rule
this out as a future possibility,
however.
Urging a level headed approach
to the future, he noted that the
House Internal Security
Committee—formerly HUAC —has
announced plans for a study of
student unrest and added: "a
good many committees can do
this within the terms of their
enabling legislation."

number so far found guilty in
campus proceedings who are still
enrolled as students is relatively
small.
Pitzer Statement
In a statement to the Stanford
community, University President
Kenneth S. Pitzer said: "For the
University to disobey a lawful
order of a governmental body
would be to turn our backs on the
very standards by which we are
attempting to govern ourselves.
"Our obligation to abide by
the law would be identical even if
we did not receive a penny from
the government.
"Equally heavy would be our
obligation to challenge, within the
means provided by law, any
action by the government
involving the University which
might be invalid. That is why I
have asked legal counsel to
examine the subpoena . . .
"We cannot guide ourselves by
the rule of law and deny that rule
when it suits us in our relations
with others. The University will
not do that, and I am confident
that the University community
will not ask it to.
Responding to questions,
Lyman said he felt it would be a
"dubious" tactic to flood the
subcommittee with extraneous
information beyond that covered
by the subpoena. The
investigating group probably will
sift the information it receives to
determine what is relevant to its
objectives.
At the same time, he pointed
out, the University does not have
"vast dossiers" on individuals and
noted that so far as he knows no
person from Stanford has yet
been subpoenaed to testify before

the subcommittee. He did nut rule
this out as a future possibility,
however.
Urging a level headed approach
to the future, he noted that the
House Internal Security
Committee—formerly HUAC —has
announced plans for a study of
student unrest and added: "a
good many committees can do
this within the terms of their
enabling legislation."
Student Reply
Jeff Kane, contacted last night
in Bill Black's absence, informed
The Daily that he for one would be
back at Stanford next year. The
popular red-headed rabble rouser
explained it this way to a
sympathetic night editor:
It appears that McClellan's
action is an attempt by the federal
government to regulate the
internal affairs of a private
university. The maintenance of
order in the University is the
University's responsibility, as it is
the University's responsibility to
determine its policies regarding
tenure, its curriculum, its guest
speakers, and the selection 01 its
officers.
The subpoena is overly broad
and should be challenged in court
by the University. But what
constitutes a disorder? On some
campuses, for instance, the
distribution of leaflets though
an exercise of free speech—may be
construed as a disruption. Also,
who determines whether a
disruption occured? The
University President? A campus
judiciary? A concerned student?
Such a determination should be
made by a court of general
jurisdiction.
''Furthermore, the federal
government is in full knowledge
of what students are receiving
federal funds. Yet the subpoena
applies to everyone engaged in
disorders, regardless of financial
status. This action exceeds federal
authority and must be challenged?
