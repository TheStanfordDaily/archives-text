# McClellan Subpoena Is Studied
## Lyman Answers Questions Before Student Legislature 
### 
Universities probably are in for
"several seasons" of Congressional
investigations, Provost Richard W.
Lyman of Stanford told the
Student Legislature Wednesday
night.
Cornell, Harvard, and Berkeley
are among the universities which
have received similar notice from
the U.S. Senate Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations,
headed by Senator John McClellan,
Arkansas Democrat.
The Stanford subpoena calls for
University records on 12
organizations and 90 named
individuals. Under existing campus
rules, all those named are being sent
letters informing them that the
University intends to comply with
the June 3 date specified by the
Subcommittee unless the
individuals concerned obtain an
injunction restraining the
University from this action.
Lyman said the Subcommittee
made no statement on criteria used
in selecting the 90 names, although
most appear to have come from
public records, such as court
documents and newspaper
accounts.
Possible Errors
The University has not made the
names public because the list
appears to have several errors, he
indicated. Several of the
organizations named have no
formal relationship with the
University and information on
others is "very sparse," he added.
While the language of the
subpoena is still being studied by
legal counsel, Lyman said he
personally had no reason to believe
it would be used by the University
as a "carpet sweeper" to pick up
anyone "suspected of harboring
dangerous thoughts."
One possible purpose for the
Senate probe is to see if universities
have complied with various "riders"
on appropriations bills barring
federal aid to those found guilty in
court or in campus proceedings of
disruptive activities, he noted.
