# New Sponsors Chosen For Freshman Dorms
## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The difficult but enjoyable task
of becoming close friends and
counselors for those freshmen who
will live in the eleven all-freshmen
dormotories will face the fifty-two
new sponsors next year.
Sponsors were chosen for next
year by a sponsor selection
committee consisting of six present
sponsors, three faculty residents
and resident directors, and three
freshmen. Freshmen have been
represented on this committee only
once before, three years ago, when
one freshman participated in the
interviews and deliberations.
According to the new head
sponsor for men, Roger Boesche,
who also was a sponsor this year,
the committee's work this year was
"a great success." 175 students
applied for the 52 places.
There are nine more sponsors in
tiie new group than there were this
year.
Members of the selection
committee each spent as much as
6 0 hours reading the essays
required of applicants, interviewing,
and deliberating about the final
choices.
Boesche said that sponsors were
chosen on the rather broad bases of
their "awareness, sensitivity, ability
to communicate, and perception."
Summers Goff, a member of the
selection committee and a sponsor
in Loro House, said of the selection
procedure, "It's pretty subjective.
Interviews are necessarily that

way." She added that she used the
general criteria of the applicant's
intellectual and emotional
maturity, as well as his sense of
self-criticism as partial basis for her
judgment.
Although there has not been
significant change in the sponsoring
system in recent years, the whole
concept of trie sponsor has changed
a great deal since the mid-fifties.
At that time the sponsor's chief
function was to place freshmen in
fraternities. The first non-fraternity
man to apply for sponsorship had
difficulty being accepted.
Charges of bias in the sponsoring
system now come from the part of
the University which once
dominated it. There have been
accusations made recently that the
sponsors are a self-perpetuating
leftist group.
Boesche, however, states that
the political aspects of sponsorship
have been greatly overemphasized.

stated.

sponsor for next year, expressed
the opinion that one of the
primary qualities essential in a
sponsor is "competence in talking
to people."

accusations made recently that the
sponsors are a self-perpetuating
leftist group.
Boesche, however, states that
the political aspects of sponsorship
have been greatly overemphasized.
"It's a bad sponsor and a rare
sponsor that wants to force their
opinions on freshman," Boesche
stated.
Carolyn Bixby, head women's
sponsor for next year, expressed
the opinion that one of the
primary qualities essential in a
sponsor is "competence in talking
to people."

Anyone wishing to apply to
become a student associate, who
will eat meals in freshmen dorms
and talk to freshmen, pick up an
application in the Wilbur office.
The difficult but enjoyable task
of becoming close friends and
counselors for those freshmen who
will live in the eleven all-freshmen
dormotories will face the fifty-two
new sponsors next year.
Sponsors were chosen for next
year by a sponsor selection
committee consisting of six present
sponsors, three faculty residents
and resident directors, and three
freshmen. Freshmen have been
represented on this committee only
once before, three years ago, when
one freshman participated in the
interviews and deliberations.
According to the new head
sponsor for men, Roger Boesche,
who also was a sponsor this year,
the committee's work this year was
"a great success." 175 students
applied for the 52 places.
There are nine more sponsors in
tiie new group than there were this
year.
Members of the selection
committee each spent as much as
6 0 hours reading the essays
required of applicants, interviewing,
and deliberating about the final
choices.
Boesche said that sponsors were
chosen on the rather broad bases of
their "awareness, sensitivity, ability
to communicate, and perception."
Summers Goff, a member of the
selection committee and a sponsor
in Loro House, said of the selection
procedure, "It's pretty subjective.
Interviews are necessarily that

way." She added that she used the
general criteria of the applicant's
intellectual and emotional
maturity, as well as his sense of
self-criticism as partial basis for her
judgment.
Although there has not been
significant change in the sponsoring
system in recent years, the whole
concept of trie sponsor has changed
a great deal since the mid-fifties.
At that time the sponsor's chief
function was to place freshmen in
fraternities. The first non-fraternity
man to apply for sponsorship had
difficulty being accepted.
Charges of bias in the sponsoring
system now come from the part of
the University which once
dominated it. There have been
accusations made recently that the
sponsors are a self-perpetuating
leftist group.
