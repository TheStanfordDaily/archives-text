# Engineers Set 'Garbage Race'
## 
### 
An "Assembled Floating
Garbage Race" and a "One Rolling
Surface Downhill Derby" Monday
afternoon on the banks of
Stanford's Lake Lagunita will
climax a Mechanical Engineering
Department course in philosophy
of design.
Ten teams of four graduate
students each will view for
originality and creativity in the
craft they build, and incidentally
try to win a race. The exercise
constitutes a sort of final exam for
the three-unit course, and they will
be graded on their success by Prof.
Robert McKim. the instructor.

to destruction at end of race,"
they add. There will be prizes for
the winning team - and for the
"most spectacular failures,"
McKim said.
The "downhill derby" rules
make the same admonitions,
including the cost limit. The
vehicles can have only one
"rolling surface" (wheel, roller or
other), must carry all four team
members downhill by gravity
alone (except for an initial
push-off by one member), and
stop within a 15-foot braking
zone.
Rivalry between the teams is
keen. Complete secrecy of
construction is being maintained,
and no advance information about
any craft was available. Team No.
3, however, claims they "are the
one to watch—that's where the
smart money is."

McKim hastened to explain
that the course also involves
extensive reading, essays, and
seminars. It focuses on the
influence of the designer's
attitudes and viewpoints, with
emphasis on understanding the
creative process. The team
construction projects, with rules
formulated by the students
themselves, are intended to test
their ingenuity—as well as provide
some fun.
When the starting gun is fired
at about 3:30 p.m., the teams will
run to their respective garbage
cans sitting on the lake's dock,
assemble their vessels and race
around an offshore marker and
back. Manpower may not be used
directly for propulsion of
floatation, so paddles or similar
gear from the cans will be needed.
"Aggressive interference with
other craft may disqualify the
aggressor-by decision of judges,"
the rules state. "Craft are subject
to destruction at end of race,"
they add. There will be prizes for
