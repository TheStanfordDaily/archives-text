# Engineers Set 'Garbage Race'
## 
### 
An "Assembled Floating
Garbage Race" and a "One Rolling
Surface Downhill Derby" Monday
afternoon on the banks of
Stanford's Lake Lagunita will
climax a Mechanical Engineering
Department course in philosophy
of design.
Ten teams of four graduate
students each will view for
originality and creativity in the
craft they build, and incidentally
try to win a race. The exercise
constitutes a sort of final exam for
the three-unit course, and they will
be graded on their success by Prof.
Robert McKim. the instructor.
