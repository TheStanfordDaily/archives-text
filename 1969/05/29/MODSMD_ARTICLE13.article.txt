# Faculty Protest SRI Decision
## 
### 
Faculty members are circulating
an open letter protesting the Board
of Trustees' SRI decision and their
"apparent disregard of the deep
concerns felt by students and
faculty alike."
Besides expressing dissatisfaction
with "the abrupt closure of the SRI
issue" by its sale, the letter
questions the University's method
of governance which in this case has
not seemed to reflect the concerns
of the University community.
The letter cites the discrepancy
between the Trustee's decision to
sell and the recent referendum
which showed 2/3 of the student
body and 1/3 of the faculty
favoring closer control of SRI and
the May 2 recommendations of the
Academic Senate for further study
before making a decision.
The letter, addressed to the
Academic Senate, President Pitzer
and the Trustees, urges the Senate
to "persevere in seeking the further
detailed exploration of alternative
possibilities."
In only its first two days of
circulation among the Faculty, the
letter has already gained about 50
signatures.
