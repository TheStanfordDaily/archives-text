## Hoover Institution Checklist 
### 
W. Glenn Campbell

If I were to try to answer all
the incorrect statements made
about the Hoover Institution in
the past two months, culminating
in the obscene grafitti painted on
the Tower over the weekend, I'd
spend most of my time saying
what the Institution is not.
I prefer instead to say what the
Hoover Institution is. I want the
members of the April 3rd
Movement to be able to judge for
themselves the validity of the
position established by Movement
spokesmen in the April 29 issue of
Declassified. According to the
editors of that publication, the
Institution's aims are:
"... to warn the world of the
evils of 'Marxism, socialism or
atheism' ... to set the cold war
climate essential to the economic
hoalth of Stanford-area war
industries."
The Hoover Institution was
founded 50 years ago by Herbert
Hoover (Stanford, '95) as a
collection of documents on the
causes and effects of World War I.
Communism had not yet
consolidated its hold on a single
state. In fact, it has been argued
that the Hoover-directed efforts
of the American Relief
Administration in Russia
contributes to saving the tottering
Soviet regime.
Peace
In 1941, when it was clear that
war and revolution had been the
strongest progeny of Versailles,
Herbert Hoover dedicated the
Hoover Tower to the promotion
of peace. It was a desire in
keeping with his Quaker
upbringing and his total

moral-ethical orientation. Mr.
Hoover did more than cry peace
when there was no peace. He
probably saw to the feeding of
more hungry, the clothing of
more naked and the sheltering of
more homeless people than any
other man in history.
The Institution is the
lengthened shadow of this great
and humane man, and will always
be identified with him. For most
of the world, that identification is
the scholarly and compassionate
one drawn above. But there are
apparently some persons at
Stanford out of touch with
informed opinion. For them, the
identification must be drawn from
Mr. Hoover's expressed
abhorrence of totalitarianism,
compulsive egalitarianism and
godlessness.
Forceful as Herbert Hoover
was in the expression of his views,
he was even more adamant that
collecting must not be dictated
nor research restricted by any
man's opinions or whims. The
collections of the Institution's
library and the character of its
research, he once wrote, were to
be "free as the Sierra winds."
Checklist
The following is a checklist
against which critics may measure
the Institution's adherence to this
scholarly liberty, especially in
light of the Declassified quotes.
Because the list is necessarily
selective and will probably not
satisfy some Movement members,
I have invited several to sit down
with me for fuller discussions.
1. A number of the nearly

1,000 visiting scholars who
register annually for intensive use
of the Hoover Institution's library
collections come from countries
ruled by Marxist-Leninist parties.
2. On September 26, 1968,
Mrs. Barbara M. Givan,
Coordinator of the Office for
Foreign Visitors at Stanford,
directed to Dr. Glenn Campbell,
Director of the Hoover
Institution, a letter which read, in
part:
"Once again, in the academic
year just ended, the Hoover
Institution participated in more
programs arranged by us than any
other University department or
institute: 147 out of 495 days'
programs planned for our total of
948 foreign visitors."
According to Mrs. Givan, 26 of
the visitors in whose reception the
Institution participated during
1967-68 came from countries
governed under Marxian socialism.
Nor is the Institution's hospitality
confined to such Stanford
channels. In the space of a single
recent week, staff members
received the following three
prominent Soviet representatives,
of which only the first was an
official University guest:
—Yuri M. Melnikov, Chairman
of the Department of U.S.
Foreign and Domestic Policy,
Institute of World Economy and
International Relations, Soviet
Academy of Sciences;
—Yuri Arbatov, head of the
Academy's new Institute of
American Studies;
—Yuri Zhukov, Pravda's
"Observer," or official voice, on
foreign affairs and a senior
Communist Party member.

3. After a visit to the
Institution, the Director of the
State Archive Administration of
the U.S.S.R., G. A. Belov, wrote
in 1967: "The largest collection
of materials in the United States
on the revolutionary movement in
Russia and also on the Soviet
Union is to be found in the library
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace at Stanford
University."
4. Knowledgeable persons
surmise that the Soviet regime
finds it advantageous and
convenient to have so large and
valuable a repository on Soviet
affairs existing in the U.S.
Whatever the Kremlin's position,
the fact is that the Institution
enjoys a beneficial exchange
relationship with the Lenin State
Library and has been able to
obtain a great number of regional
and provincial newspapers and
other publications not ordinarily
made available to American
institutions.
5. While the relationship is a
good deal more erratic, the
Institution also maintains
exchange arrangements with the
National Library in Peking.
Debt
6. Without in any way
attempting to link the views of
the following disparate
personages, it may be said that

they all—and their number is not
exhausted below —owe some debt
of authorship or support to the
Institution:
—Theodore Draper, Institution
Research Fellow, who wrote in his
Preface to Abuse of Power
(Viking, 1967), a powerful
critique of U.S. interventions in
Vietnam and in the Caribbean:
"I am indebted to the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace at Stanford University,
and to its Director, Dr. W. Glenn
Campbell, for making it possible
to carry on my work, freely and
independently."
—I. I. Potekhin, Director of the
African Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, who
contributed "On African
Socialism: A Soviet View," to
African Socialism, a symposium
edited by William H. Friedland of
Cornell and Carl G. Rosberg, Jr.
of Berkeley and published by the
Institution in 1964.
—John E. Rue, now of Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan,
whose Mao Tse-tung in
Opposition, 1927-1935, published
by the Institution in 1966, is one
volume of three on the Chinese
leader supported by Hoover
grants. Rue's sympathetic
handling of his subject is perhaps
less significant than the volume's
dedication to a self-proclaimed
pacifist, Mulford Sibley, whose
name is anathema to true cold
warriors. (Let it be clearly
understood: These are facts, not
insinuations about Rue or Sibley,
China, Mao or pacifism.)
Truth
7. Another recent institution
publication is Fifty Years of
Communism in Russia, based on a
Hoover-sponsored conference of
the same title in October, 1967.
The progressive journal, The
Nation, felt the conference came
"closer to the truth about the
Soviet Union" than the
Red-baiting attributed by the
journal to the press and the
federal government. Among the
welcomed observers at the
meeting were the Second
Secretary of the Soviet Embassy
in Washington and the New York
representative of the Soviet
telegraph news agency, TASS.
8. Pursuant to Herbert
Hoover's desire that the
Institution "promote peace," the
conference marking the
celebration of the Hoover
Institution's 50th anniversary in
November will have the title
"Peaceful Change in Modern
Society." Among the scholars and
public figures having accepted
invitations to speak are Sir Percy
Spender of Australia, a Judge of
the International Court of Justice;
the Honorable Bernt lngvaldsen,
President of the Norwegian
Storting (Parliament) and
Chairman of the Norwegian Peace
Prize Committee; and Prof. Hilary
Conroy of the University of
Pennsylvania, Chairman of the
Committee on Peace Research in
History.

If I were to try to answer all
the incorrect statements made
about the Hoover Institution in
the past two months, culminating
in the obscene grafitti painted on
the Tower over the weekend, I'd
spend most of my time saying
what the Institution is not.
I prefer instead to say what the
Hoover Institution is. I want the
members of the April 3rd
Movement to be able to judge for
themselves the validity of the
position established by Movement
spokesmen in the April 29 issue of
Declassified. According to the
editors of that publication, the
Institution's aims are:
"... to warn the world of the
evils of 'Marxism, socialism or
atheism' ... to set the cold war
climate essential to the economic
hoalth of Stanford-area war
industries."
The Hoover Institution was
founded 50 years ago by Herbert
Hoover (Stanford, '95) as a
collection of documents on the
causes and effects of World War I.
Communism had not yet
consolidated its hold on a single
state. In fact, it has been argued
that the Hoover-directed efforts
of the American Relief
Administration in Russia
contributes to saving the tottering
Soviet regime.
Peace
In 1941, when it was clear that
war and revolution had been the
strongest progeny of Versailles,
Herbert Hoover dedicated the
Hoover Tower to the promotion
of peace. It was a desire in
keeping with his Quaker
upbringing and his total

moral-ethical orientation. Mr.
Hoover did more than cry peace
when there was no peace. He
probably saw to the feeding of
more hungry, the clothing of
more naked and the sheltering of
more homeless people than any
other man in history.
The Institution is the
lengthened shadow of this great
and humane man, and will always
be identified with him. For most
of the world, that identification is
the scholarly and compassionate
one drawn above. But there are
apparently some persons at
Stanford out of touch with
informed opinion. For them, the
identification must be drawn from
Mr. Hoover's expressed
abhorrence of totalitarianism,
compulsive egalitarianism and
godlessness.
Forceful as Herbert Hoover
was in the expression of his views,
he was even more adamant that
collecting must not be dictated
nor research restricted by any
man's opinions or whims. The
collections of the Institution's
library and the character of its
research, he once wrote, were to
be "free as the Sierra winds."
Checklist
The following is a checklist
against which critics may measure
the Institution's adherence to this
scholarly liberty, especially in
light of the Declassified quotes.
Because the list is necessarily
selective and will probably not
satisfy some Movement members,
I have invited several to sit down
with me for fuller discussions.
1. A number of the nearly

1,000 visiting scholars who
register annually for intensive use
of the Hoover Institution's library
collections come from countries
ruled by Marxist-Leninist parties.
2. On September 26, 1968,
Mrs. Barbara M. Givan,
Coordinator of the Office for
Foreign Visitors at Stanford,
directed to Dr. Glenn Campbell,
Director of the Hoover
Institution, a letter which read, in
part:
"Once again, in the academic
year just ended, the Hoover
Institution participated in more
programs arranged by us than any
other University department or

programs planned for our total of

According to Mrs. Givan, 26 of
the visitors in whose reception the
Institution participated during
1967-68 came from countries
governed under Marxian socialism.
Nor is the Institution's hospitality
confined to such Stanford
channels. In the space of a single
recent week, staff members
received the following three
prominent Soviet representatives,
of which only the first was an
official University guest:
—Yuri M. Melnikov, Chairman
of the Department of U.S.
Foreign and Domestic Policy,
Institute of World Economy and
International Relations, Soviet
Academy of Sciences;
—Yuri Arbatov, head of the
Academy's new Institute of

4. Knowledgeable persons
surmise that the Soviet regime
finds it advantageous and
convenient to have so large and
valuable a repository on Soviet
affairs existing in the U.S.
Whatever the Kremlin's position,
the fact is that the Institution
enjoys a beneficial exchange
relationship with the Lenin State

obtain a great number of regional
and provincial newspapers and
other publications not ordinarily
made available to American
institutions.
5. While the relationship is a
good deal more erratic, the
Institution also maintains
exchange arrangements with the
National Library in Peking.
Debt
6. Without in any way
attempting to link the views of
the following disparate
personages, it may be said that

they all—and their number is not
exhausted below —owe some debt
of authorship or support to the
Institution:
—Theodore Draper, Institution
Research Fellow, who wrote in his
Preface to Abuse of Power
(Viking, 1967), a powerful
critique of U.S. interventions in
Vietnam and in the Caribbean:
"I am indebted to the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution

Campbell, for making it possible
to carry on my work, freely and

—I. I. Potekhin, Director of the
African Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, who
contributed "On African
Socialism: A Soviet View," to
African Socialism, a symposium
edited by William H. Friedland of
Cornell and Carl G. Rosberg, Jr.
of Berkeley and published by the
Institution in 1964.
—John E. Rue, now of Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan,
whose Mao Tse-tung in
Opposition, 1927-1935, published
by the Institution in 1966, is one
volume of three on the Chinese
leader supported by Hoover
grants. Rue's sympathetic
handling of his subject is perhaps
less significant than the volume's
dedication to a self-proclaimed

6. Without in any way
attempting to link the views of

—Theodore Draper, Institution
Research Fellow, who wrote in his
Preface to Abuse of Power
(Viking, 1967), a powerful
critique of U.S. interventions in
Vietnam and in the Caribbean:
"I am indebted to the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace at Stanford University,
and to its Director, Dr. W. Glenn
Campbell, for making it possible

—I. I. Potekhin, Director of the

contributed "On African
Socialism: A Soviet View," to
African Socialism, a symposium
edited by William H. Friedland of
Cornell and Carl G. Rosberg, Jr.
of Berkeley and published by the
Institution in 1964.
—John E. Rue, now of Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan,
whose Mao Tse-tung in
Opposition, 1927-1935, published
by the Institution in 1966, is one
volume of three on the Chinese
leader supported by Hoover
grants. Rue's sympathetic
handling of his subject is perhaps
less significant than the volume's
dedication to a self-proclaimed
pacifist, Mulford Sibley, whose
name is anathema to true cold
warriors. (Let it be clearly
understood: These are facts, not
insinuations about Rue or Sibley,
China, Mao or pacifism.)

If I were to try to answer all
the incorrect statements made
about the Hoover Institution in
the past two months, culminating
in the obscene grafitti painted on
the Tower over the weekend, I'd
spend most of my time saying
what the Institution is not.
I prefer instead to say what the
Hoover Institution is. I want the
members of the April 3rd
Movement to be able to judge for
themselves the validity of the
position established by Movement
spokesmen in the April 29 issue of
Declassified. According to the
editors of that publication, the

"... to warn the world of the
evils of 'Marxism, socialism or

climate essential to the economic
hoalth of Stanford-area war
industries."
The Hoover Institution was
founded 50 years ago by Herbert
Hoover (Stanford, '95) as a
collection of documents on the
causes and effects of World War I.
Communism had not yet
consolidated its hold on a single
state. In fact, it has been argued
that the Hoover-directed efforts
of the American Relief
Administration in Russia
contributes to saving the tottering
Soviet regime.
Peace
In 1941, when it was clear that
war and revolution had been the
strongest progeny of Versailles,
Herbert Hoover dedicated the
Hoover Tower to the promotion
of peace. It was a desire in
keeping with his Quaker
upbringing and his total

moral-ethical orientation. Mr.
Hoover did more than cry peace
when there was no peace. He
probably saw to the feeding of
more hungry, the clothing of
more naked and the sheltering of
more homeless people than any
other man in history.
The Institution is the
lengthened shadow of this great
and humane man, and will always
be identified with him. For most
of the world, that identification is
the scholarly and compassionate
one drawn above. But there are
apparently some persons at
Stanford out of touch with
informed opinion. For them, the
identification must be drawn from
Mr. Hoover's expressed
abhorrence of totalitarianism,
compulsive egalitarianism and
godlessness.
Forceful as Herbert Hoover
was in the expression of his views,
he was even more adamant that
collecting must not be dictated
nor research restricted by any
man's opinions or whims. The
collections of the Institution's
library and the character of its
research, he once wrote, were to
be "free as the Sierra winds."
Checklist
The following is a checklist
against which critics may measure
the Institution's adherence to this
scholarly liberty, especially in
light of the Declassified quotes.
Because the list is necessarily
selective and will probably not
satisfy some Movement members,
I have invited several to sit down
with me for fuller discussions.
1. A number of the nearly

1,000 visiting scholars who
register annually for intensive use
of the Hoover Institution's library
collections come from countries
ruled by Marxist-Leninist parties.
2. On September 26, 1968,
Mrs. Barbara M. Givan,
Coordinator of the Office for
Foreign Visitors at Stanford,
directed to Dr. Glenn Campbell,
Director of the Hoover
Institution, a letter which read, in
part:
"Once again, in the academic
year just ended, the Hoover
Institution participated in more
programs arranged by us than any
other University department or
institute: 147 out of 495 days'
programs planned for our total of
948 foreign visitors."
According to Mrs. Givan, 26 of
the visitors in whose reception the
Institution participated during
1967-68 came from countries
governed under Marxian socialism.
Nor is the Institution's hospitality
confined to such Stanford
channels. In the space of a single
recent week, staff members
received the following three
prominent Soviet representatives,
of which only the first was an
official University guest:
—Yuri M. Melnikov, Chairman
of the Department of U.S.
Foreign and Domestic Policy,
Institute of World Economy and
International Relations, Soviet
Academy of Sciences;
—Yuri Arbatov, head of the
Academy's new Institute of
American Studies;
—Yuri Zhukov, Pravda's
"Observer," or official voice, on
foreign affairs and a senior
Communist Party member.

on the revolutionary movement in
Russia and also on the Soviet
Union is to be found in the library
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace at Stanford
University."
4. Knowledgeable persons
surmise that the Soviet regime
finds it advantageous and
convenient to have so large and
valuable a repository on Soviet
affairs existing in the U.S.
Whatever the Kremlin's position,
the fact is that the Institution
enjoys a beneficial exchange
relationship with the Lenin State

According to Mrs. Givan, 26 of
the visitors in whose reception the
Institution participated during
1967-68 came from countries
governed under Marxian socialism.
Nor is the Institution's hospitality
confined to such Stanford
channels. In the space of a single
recent week, staff members
received the following three
prominent Soviet representatives,
of which only the first was an
official University guest:
—Yuri M. Melnikov, Chairman
of the Department of U.S.
Foreign and Domestic Policy,
Institute of World Economy and
International Relations, Soviet
Academy of Sciences;
—Yuri Arbatov, head of the
Academy's new Institute of
American Studies;
—Yuri Zhukov, Pravda's
"Observer," or official voice, on
foreign affairs and a senior
Communist Party member.

3. After a visit to the
Institution, the Director of the
State Archive Administration of
the U.S.S.R., G. A. Belov, wrote
in 1967: "The largest collection
of materials in the United States
on the revolutionary movement in
Russia and also on the Soviet
Union is to be found in the library
of the Hoover Institution on War,
Revolution and Peace at Stanford
University."
4. Knowledgeable persons
surmise that the Soviet regime
finds it advantageous and
convenient to have so large and
valuable a repository on Soviet
affairs existing in the U.S.
Whatever the Kremlin's position,
the fact is that the Institution
enjoys a beneficial exchange
relationship with the Lenin State
Library and has been able to
obtain a great number of regional
and provincial newspapers and
other publications not ordinarily
made available to American
institutions.
5. While the relationship is a
good deal more erratic, the
Institution also maintains
exchange arrangements with the
National Library in Peking.
Debt
6. Without in any way
attempting to link the views of
the following disparate
personages, it may be said that

they all—and their number is not
exhausted below —owe some debt
of authorship or support to the
Institution:
—Theodore Draper, Institution
Research Fellow, who wrote in his
Preface to Abuse of Power
(Viking, 1967), a powerful
critique of U.S. interventions in
Vietnam and in the Caribbean:
"I am indebted to the Hoover
Institution on War, Revolution
and Peace at Stanford University,
and to its Director, Dr. W. Glenn
Campbell, for making it possible
to carry on my work, freely and
independently."
—I. I. Potekhin, Director of the
African Institute of the Soviet
Academy of Sciences, who
contributed "On African
Socialism: A Soviet View," to
African Socialism, a symposium
edited by William H. Friedland of
Cornell and Carl G. Rosberg, Jr.
of Berkeley and published by the
Institution in 1964.
—John E. Rue, now of Oakland
University, Rochester, Michigan,
whose Mao Tse-tung in
Opposition, 1927-1935, published
by the Institution in 1966, is one
volume of three on the Chinese
leader supported by Hoover
grants. Rue's sympathetic
handling of his subject is perhaps
less significant than the volume's
dedication to a self-proclaimed
pacifist, Mulford Sibley, whose
name is anathema to true cold
warriors. (Let it be clearly
understood: These are facts, not
insinuations about Rue or Sibley,
China, Mao or pacifism.)
Truth
7. Another recent institution
publication is Fifty Years of
Communism in Russia, based on a
Hoover-sponsored conference of
the same title in October, 1967.
The progressive journal, The
Nation, felt the conference came
"closer to the truth about the
Soviet Union" than the
Red-baiting attributed by the
journal to the press and the
federal government. Among the
welcomed observers at the
meeting were the Second
Secretary of the Soviet Embassy
in Washington and the New York
representative of the Soviet
telegraph news agency, TASS.
8. Pursuant to Herbert
Hoover's desire that the
Institution "promote peace," the
conference marking the
celebration of the Hoover
Institution's 50th anniversary in
November will have the title
"Peaceful Change in Modern
Society." Among the scholars and
public figures having accepted
invitations to speak are Sir Percy
Spender of Australia, a Judge of
the International Court of Justice;
the Honorable Bernt lngvaldsen,
President of the Norwegian
Storting (Parliament) and
Chairman of the Norwegian Peace
Prize Committee; and Prof. Hilary
Conroy of the University of
Pennsylvania, Chairman of the
Committee on Peace Research in
History.

If I were to try to answer all
the incorrect statements made
about the Hoover Institution in
the past two months, culminating
in the obscene grafitti painted on
the Tower over the weekend, I'd
spend most of my time saying
what the Institution is not.
I prefer instead to say what the
Hoover Institution is. I want the
members of the April 3rd
Movement to be able to judge for
themselves the validity of the
position established by Movement
spokesmen in the April 29 issue of
Declassified. According to the
editors of that publication, the
Institution's aims are:
"... to warn the world of the
evils of 'Marxism, socialism or
atheism' ... to set the cold war
climate essential to the economic
hoalth of Stanford-area war
industries."
The Hoover Institution was
founded 50 years ago by Herbert
Hoover (Stanford, '95) as a
collection of documents on the
causes and effects of World War I.
Communism had not yet
consolidated its hold on a single
state. In fact, it has been argued
that the Hoover-directed efforts
of the American Relief
Administration in Russia
contributes to saving the tottering
Soviet regime.
Peace
In 1941, when it was clear that
war and revolution had been the
strongest progeny of Versailles,
Herbert Hoover dedicated the
Hoover Tower to the promotion
of peace. It was a desire in
keeping with his Quaker
upbringing and his total

moral-ethical orientation. Mr.
Hoover did more than cry peace
when there was no peace. He
probably saw to the feeding of
more hungry, the clothing of
more naked and the sheltering of
more homeless people than any
other man in history.
The Institution is the
lengthened shadow of this great
and humane man, and will always
be identified with him. For most
of the world, that identification is
the scholarly and compassionate
one drawn above. But there are
apparently some persons at
Stanford out of touch with
informed opinion. For them, the
identification must be drawn from
Mr. Hoover's expressed
abhorrence of totalitarianism,
compulsive egalitarianism and
godlessness.
Forceful as Herbert Hoover
was in the expression of his views,
he was even more adamant that
collecting must not be dictated
nor research restricted by any
man's opinions or whims. The
collections of the Institution's
library and the character of its
research, he once wrote, were to
be "free as the Sierra winds."
Checklist
The following is a checklist
against which critics may measure
the Institution's adherence to this
scholarly liberty, especially in
light of the Declassified quotes.
Because the list is necessarily
selective and will probably not
satisfy some Movement members,
I have invited several to sit down
with me for fuller discussions.
1. A number of the nearly

1,000 visiting scholars who
register annually for intensive use
of the Hoover Institution's library
collections come from countries
ruled by Marxist-Leninist parties.
2. On September 26, 1968,
Mrs. Barbara M. Givan,
Coordinator of the Office for
Foreign Visitors at Stanford,
directed to Dr. Glenn Campbell,
Director of the Hoover
Institution, a letter which read, in
part:
"Once again, in the academic
year just ended, the Hoover
Institution participated in more
programs arranged by us than any
other University department or
institute: 147 out of 495 days'
programs planned for our total of
948 foreign visitors."
According to Mrs. Givan, 26 of
the visitors in whose reception the
