## Leftist McCarthyism: Threat Of Guilt By Association 
### 
Editor, Til E DA IL Y:
The exchange May 26 between
Meaders and Thuman o( SRI and
THE DAILY in its many
manifestations ("straight"' news,
editorial, direct reply, feature
article, etc.) should be carefully
studied by the whole Stanford
community, whatever their
position on issues, since the
meaning of words and truth is so
strongly involved. If we are to
have rational and useful dialogue,
we must have respect for objective
reporting and not sanction the use
of half truths to inflame our
emotions.
The central point is Mr.
Sweeney's accusation that SRI has
done "extensive work on the
technique of aerial spraying of CS
tear gas used by the National
Guard" at Berkeley. This is a very
direct statement that work was
done on the specific techniques
used at Berkeley. Mr. Sweeney's
defense of his position must be
closely studied. It consists of a
series of disconnected contract
descriptions in which the words
"CS agents," "aerosol
generators," "nozzle design,' !and
"bomblets" are used. Since such
words can also be related to the
helicopter techniques used by the
National Guard at Berkeley, Mr.
Sweeney states "SRI has done
extensive work" on those specific
techniques used at Berkeley and
on related use of nerve gas.
In the early 1950's we went
through another very disturbed
period. That was due to a deep
feeling of insecurity on the part of
the American public resulting
from fear of world communism.
Out of this came the "witch
hunts" that now go by the name
of "McCarthyism," since Senator
Joe McCarthy made such strong
use of them. One prime
characteristic of "McCarthyism"

was "guilt by association." ll' one
had over associated with a
communist, or advocated a policy
embraced by the communists (for
example, racial equality), one was
associated with communism. The
writings of Mr. Sweeney are a new
example of such "guilt by
association" in that he infers that
if SRI worked on aerosol
dispersion, and if any technique
of aerosol dispersion was used at
Berkeley, SRI is responsible for
what happened at Berkeley.
We have not yet fully
recovered from the damage of the
"McCarthyism" of the right in the
'50\s. Let us not now encourage a
new "McCarthyism" of the left.

• School Of Nursing
Editor, Till DAILY:
As a graduating nursing
student, I feel it necessary to
respond to Tuesday's article in
The Daily about Stanford's
School of Nursing.
The first problem concerns the

school's lack of financial
autonomy; the school of nursing
is financially controlled by the
School of Medicine. Il has only a
few thousand dollars at its
disposal and only a five-year
baccalaureate program. But with
tuition going up again next year,
few students can afford to take
five years to get their degree in
nursing, when they can go to a
four-year program (e.g. Cal) that
is cheaper and has more extensive
funds for scholarships.
Another glaring problem has
been the failure of the School of
Nursing to utilize the resources of

the University and the
community. While the students
have been encouraged to attend
classes outside the nursing
department, little has been done
to develop aad incorporate
contributions of other schools
within the University into the
School of Nursing.
"Many students have
experienced lack of administrative
support as well as financial
support. Communication between
students and administration has
been poor and there have been no
Black students admitted to our
school in years because of the

inflexibility of the existing
entrance requirements.
Miss Derby stated in her article
that a comprehensive study of
nursing education at Stanford is
underway. She failed to mention
that if solutions to some of the
above problems are not found, the
Stanford School of Nursing may
be closed.

• No Pacifist
Editor, THE DAILY:
Jesus Christ! The title to my
article was "The Violence-Non

violence Problem" not "Pacifist
has Fears about the ASM." I am
not a pacifist. I think I made it
quite clear in the article the
violence of the NLF and other
guerrilla movements, and
moreover, realize the possible
usefulness of violence in the U.S.
for social change. "I find it
difficult to be a pacifist" should
read "I cannot be a pacifist."
Secondly, I did not use "A3M"
in the article at all. Anyone with a
grain of political awareness must
realize that "Movement" refers to
a nationwide phenomena of which
the A3M is one of the more

candy-assed manifestations. The
title you foisted upon my article
immediately lumps me in with
those who are still whining about
Encina. In fact, I have been in this
drive from the January 14 trustee
disruption to the blockade at SRI.
The heavyweights at whom the
second half of the article is aimed
(the first part speaks to the
pacifists) probably never read past
your title.
I tried to present an analysis of
one of the current problems of
the national Movement. Your title
made me sound like Paul Rupert's
mother. Jeff Weil
