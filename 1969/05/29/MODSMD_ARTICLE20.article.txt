## Biafra's Second Independence Anniversary 
### 
Hypolite I. Amuzie

Two years ago, the British
government through her Nigerian
tool, announced to the world that
they were undertaking "a two
week police action" to stop the
rebellion in Biafra. For two years
the war has raged on without any
substantial support for Biafra
from the outside.
Without any grasp of reality,
and unable or unwilling to
recognize the Biafran will and to
draw the inescapable, logical
conclusions, the British, Russian
and Egyptian governments
through their stooges, the
Nigerian Government, today live
under the domination of desires
and prophesies. As formidable as
this unholy alliance may seem,
they are baffled day and day to
learn that the movement is solid,

rooted in the masses and driven
by it.
Yes, for two years, the Biafran
people have lived under inhuman
conditions, but they have also
been monolithic. This is because
the issue is exceptionally clear and
simple. She has a proud heritage
to defend and preserve. She wants
to preserve her democratic and
free institutions as a progressive
society unhampered in its progress
and development by feudalistic,
communistic, colonial, and
reactionay forces with which it
has been her misfortune to
contend all these years.
The British-Nigerian alliance
has also made it very clear that
there would be no negotiated
settlement. The only fact to
discern here is the familiar
Nazi-Jewish example, "The

program on the Third Reich's
policy towards the Jewish
question will not take place, due
to the refusal of representatives of
Herr Hitler's government to
discuss what is regarded as a
purely domestic issue."
The United Nations as well as
the neo-colonialist organ,
"Organization of African
Disunity" has clearly
demonstrated their complicity in
the Biafran genocide. As the
unholy alliance of Britain, Russia,
Egypt and Nigeria systematically
move towards the total
destruction of the Biafrans, the
government and people of the
United States remain bystanders,
despite evidence pouring in from
official and unofficial sources.
While millions of Biafrans perish,
some Americans are busy

galavanting around the moon as
others go about their businesses
unmoved and unconcerned.
Bystanders to the cruelty and
d eh u m a n is a t i on become
bystanders to genocide. This kind
of silence can only rightly be
construed as proof of complicity.
These odds and obstacles seem
insurmontable, but Biafra is
bound to pull through it all. On
May 30th the young republic
celebrates her second anniversary
of hard bound independence. Her
friends, admirers and well wishers
all over the world will no doubt
be joining her to celebrate this
second anniversary of
independence. I therefore join
them in extending my best wishes
for progress and prosperity to the
fourteen million peace loving and
hard working people of Biafra on

this historic occasion.
N.B. The Biafran Association
of Northern California has
cordially invited the general
public to an Independence day
party at 8 p.m., Friday, May 30th
Phelan Hall, University of San
Francisco.
