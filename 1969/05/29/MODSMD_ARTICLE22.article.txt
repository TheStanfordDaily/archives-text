# Domestic Colonialism At Stanford?
## 
### EDWARD BERNSTEIN BERNARD GREENFELD 
Stanford, like all capitalist
institutions, has long used the
black community as a large source
of cheap labor. The fortune that
built Stanford University was
amassed by the brutal
exploitation of Chinese laborers
by Leland Stanford. The Trustees
who rule Stanford today also
direct corporations that make
huge profits by exploiting workers
and resources at home and in the
third world. These men also serve
as directors or members of
organizations like Stanford
Research Institute, Hoover
Institution and Council on
Foreign Relations which are
designed to maintain and expand
their corporate wealth and power.
The Housekeeping Department
at Stanford University Hospital
employs about 160 workers,
mostly Black people from East
Palo Alto. The workers see
Stanford Hospital as a leading
institution that assumes power for
setting salary and working
condition guidelines that
determine what other hospitals
will offer. These workers are now
uniting behind a set of demands
that, when met, will improve the
lives of hospital workers and their
families in the whole Bay Area if
not the whole West.
The demands are as follows:
I. We want a Workers
Association recognized by
Stanford University Hospital as
the representative of the best
interest of the housekeeping
workers.
11. We want a living wage
necessary to survive in the
community we live in.
111. We want our true take
home pay and raise schedule

clearly stated at the beginning of
our job.
IV. We want job security and
the opportunity for education and
advancement for other types of
hospital work.
V. We want a clear description
of the regular duties of the janitor
separate from wall washer and
floor stripers and other higher
salaried jobs.
VI. We want an end to
favoritism, mental cruelty, and
inhumane working conditions.
VII. We want to be able to
work without our supervisors and
their fellow eyes spying on us,
reporting on us and breathing
down our backs.
VIII. We want fair rules on
lateness that apply equally to
everyone, and one person chosen
by their fellow workers to mark
the late and tardiness book.
IX. We want longer breaks and
a full Lunch Hour.
X. We want fully insured,
comprehensive outpatient and
inpatient health care for hospital
workers and their family.
XI. We want uniforms
furnished and laundered by the
hospital.
XII. We want the executive
supervisor to meet monthly with
the employees, to be better
acquainted with the workers and
to spend more time at the hospital
devoted to improving the
conditions of the workers.
XIII. We want a fair hearing
with legal counsel before being
terminated from the job.
XIV. We want our supervisors
responsible to the workers and
capable of communicating with
them and therefore they must be
elected by their fellow workers to
insure this.
Yesterday the workers in the

Housekeeping Department met
and all but a handful voted to
support the formation of the
Workers Association.
A support statement has been
circulated at the Medical Center
and has been signed by 300
non-housekeeping employees so
far. It reads
"To meet demands of a rising cost of
living and general lack of concern, the
members of housekeeping and maid
service have asked the hospital and
medical school to reevaluate wages and
working conditions for members of
their departments. These departments
are largely composed of minority
people (Black, Mexican-American etc.)
Throughout the growth of this
hospital and medical school center, the
needs of these people have been
consistently overlooked. They are now
asking that their fellow employees (lab
technicians, nurses, doctors etc.) show
their concern over the lack of attention
their problems have received."
Janitors have take home pay of
about $310 per month, and it is
common for men to hold two jobs
and work 16 hours per day. In
regard to their request for a salary
increase, workers sent the
following explanation to the
hospital administrator:
"If an increase is in any measure to
relieve the financial pressure we are
now subject to, it must be sufficiently
substantial to provide a "take home"
check that would accomplish the
following:
1) Preclude the necessity of
working two jobs which would allow
us time to adequately function as a
"Father figure" in the home, and to
provide time for rest and relaxation.
2) Permit the mothers of the
household to stay in the home and
provide guidance and care for the
children.
3) Adequately meet living expense

at today's inflated prices.
4) Have sufficient funds to keep
our communis from being called,
slum."
Because Housekeeping jobs are
the least skilled, they are
individually expendable and most
liable to exploitation and
intimidation; but their function as
a unit is indispensible. They are
told they are here at the good will
of Stanford University and every
effort is made to prevent them
from forming collectives or
unions. Dissatisfied workers who
understand their oppression are
labeled as troublemakers, isolated
from other workers, told not to
talk to students and threatened
with firing. They are played off
against each other with small wage
differences and are rewarded for
spying and tattling on their fellow
workers.
Promotions are granted not by
experience and qualification but
by favoritism and loyalty to the
white southern female
$ 1 5,000/ year executive
administrator. Housekeeping
employees are excluded from
education and decision making
processes. Spanish speaking
workers are often given directions
in pantomine because there are no
Spanish speaking supervisors. The
specific incident that united the
workers was the promotion of
two white newcomers to
supervisory positions over Black
oldtimers with 10 years
experience. Just two weeks earlier
the whites were assigned as
assistants to the blacks.
The job description for a
medical center janitor is
exquisitely exhaustive:
b) Employee maintains his assigned
area according to established
housekeeping standards, which
include:
1) Floor care: Sweeping, dust
mopping, wet mopping,
semi-stripping, waxing, buffing, base
board cleaning and spot and spillage
removal.
2) Bathroom and Shower stall care,
toilet bowl, wash basins, showers,
shower walls, changing shower
curtains, polishing chrome, floor
care, wall washing, spot washing
walls, trash removal, cleaning trash
containers, replenishing toilet tissue,
paper towels, soap, and periodic
policing.
3) Miscellaneous duties such as:
window washing, cleaning window

screens, washing and polishing
furniture, wall washing, washing
glass doors and mirrors, dusting,
washing wood work and cabinets.
c) Delivery of clean linen to using
areas and returns empty linen carts to
Linen Room.
d) Reports to his Supervisor needed
minor repairs to building and
equipment; maintains housekeeping
equipment by careful use, frequent
cleaning and proper storage. Uses
supplies and materials as directed,
safeguards materials by proper storage.
e) Performs related duties as
assigned by Supervisors such as:
1) Furniture moving, set-ups for
special meetings, isolation or
contamination cleaning, assisting
with emergencies.
Representatives from the
janitorial and maid services who
formulated the demands two
weeks ago have met twice since
then with hospital administrators.
The liberal director of the
hospital, Dr. Thomas Gonda,
Professor of Psychiatry, has said
he agrees with all the demands
and "wants to see more of this
kind of thing." There has been no
action taken by the hospital
administration to implement any
of the demands so far. It is felt
that some of the problems can be
worked out internally. But if the
demand for living wages cannot be
met by reallocating money with
the present Medical Center budget
then it is likely that the Stanford
Board of Trustees would have to
act—and Judge Ben Duniway says
the Trustees don't have much
power. And Big Bill Hewlett
doesn't make nerve gas.
A final point: Stanford Medical
Center's dealings with its
housekeeping workers parallel its
medical dealings with the black
community. There are
documented cases of East Palo
Alto residents being sent away
from the Emergency Room
because of insufficient
funds—several children with high
fevers are known to have been
sent to the County Hospital
without being seen by a physician.
Stanford Medical Center has
always been more willing to
Research communities like East
Palo Alto and East Menlo Park
than to serve their needs.

Representatives from the
janitorial and maid services who
formulated the demands two
weeks ago have met twice since
then with hospital administrators.
The liberal director of the
hospital, Dr. Thomas Gonda,
Professor of Psychiatry, has said
he agrees with all the demands
and "wants to see more of this
kind of thing." There has been no
action taken by the hospital
administration to implement any
of the demands so far. It is felt
that some of the problems can be
worked out internally. But if the
demand for living wages cannot be
met by reallocating money with
the present Medical Center budget
then it is likely that the Stanford
Board of Trustees would have to
act—and Judge Ben Duniway says
the Trustees don't have much
power. And Big Bill Hewlett

A final point: Stanford Medical
Center's dealings with its
housekeeping workers parallel its
medical dealings with the black
community. There are
documented cases of East Palo
Alto residents being sent away
from the Emergency Room
because of insufficient
funds—several children with high
fevers are known to have been
sent to the County Hospital
without being seen by a physician.
Stanford Medical Center has
always been more willing to
Research communities like East
Palo Alto and East Menlo Park
than to serve their needs.

Stanford, like all capitalist
institutions, has long used the
black community as a large source
of cheap labor. The fortune that
built Stanford University was
amassed by the brutal
exploitation of Chinese laborers
by Leland Stanford. The Trustees
who rule Stanford today also
direct corporations that make
huge profits by exploiting workers
and resources at home and in the
third world. These men also serve
as directors or members of
organizations like Stanford
Research Institute, Hoover
Institution and Council on
Foreign Relations which are
designed to maintain and expand
their corporate wealth and power.
The Housekeeping Department
at Stanford University Hospital
employs about 160 workers,
mostly Black people from East
Palo Alto. The workers see
Stanford Hospital as a leading
institution that assumes power for
setting salary and working
condition guidelines that
determine what other hospitals
will offer. These workers are now
uniting behind a set of demands
that, when met, will improve the
lives of hospital workers and their
families in the whole Bay Area if
not the whole West.
The demands are as follows:
I. We want a Workers
Association recognized by
Stanford University Hospital as
the representative of the best
interest of the housekeeping
workers.
11. We want a living wage
necessary to survive in the
community we live in.
111. We want our true take
home pay and raise schedule

clearly stated at the beginning of
our job.
IV. We want job security and
the opportunity for education and
advancement for other types of
hospital work.
V. We want a clear description
of the regular duties of the janitor
separate from wall washer and
floor stripers and other higher
salaried jobs.
VI. We want an end to
favoritism, mental cruelty, and
inhumane working conditions.
VII. We want to be able to
work without our supervisors and
their fellow eyes spying on us,
reporting on us and breathing
down our backs.
VIII. We want fair rules on
lateness that apply equally to
everyone, and one person chosen
by their fellow workers to mark
the late and tardiness book.
IX. We want longer breaks and
a full Lunch Hour.
X. We want fully insured,
comprehensive outpatient and
inpatient health care for hospital
workers and their family.
XI. We want uniforms
furnished and laundered by the
hospital.
XII. We want the executive
supervisor to meet monthly with
the employees, to be better
acquainted with the workers and
to spend more time at the hospital
devoted to improving the
conditions of the workers.
XIII. We want a fair hearing
with legal counsel before being
terminated from the job.
XIV. We want our supervisors
responsible to the workers and
capable of communicating with
them and therefore they must be
elected by their fellow workers to
insure this.
Yesterday the workers in the

Housekeeping Department met
and all but a handful voted to
support the formation of the
Workers Association.
A support statement has been
circulated at the Medical Center
and has been signed by 300
non-housekeeping employees so
far. It reads
"To meet demands of a rising cost of
living and general lack of concern, the
members of housekeeping and maid
service have asked the hospital and
medical school to reevaluate wages and
working conditions for members of
their departments. These departments
are largely composed of minority
people (Black, Mexican-American etc.)
Throughout the growth of this
hospital and medical school center, the
needs of these people have been
consistently overlooked. They are now
asking that their fellow employees (lab
technicians, nurses, doctors etc.) show
their concern over the lack of attention
their problems have received."
Janitors have take home pay of
about $310 per month, and it is
common for men to hold two jobs
and work 16 hours per day. In
regard to their request for a salary
increase, workers sent the
following explanation to the
hospital administrator:
"If an increase is in any measure to
relieve the financial pressure we are
now subject to, it must be sufficiently
substantial to provide a "take home"
check that would accomplish the
following:
1) Preclude the necessity of
working two jobs which would allow
us time to adequately function as a
"Father figure" in the home, and to
provide time for rest and relaxation.
2) Permit the mothers of the
household to stay in the home and
provide guidance and care for the
children.
3) Adequately meet living expense

at today's inflated prices.
4) Have sufficient funds to keep
our communis from being called,
slum."
Because Housekeeping jobs are
the least skilled, they are
individually expendable and most
liable to exploitation and
intimidation; but their function as
a unit is indispensible. They are
told they are here at the good will
of Stanford University and every
effort is made to prevent them
from forming collectives or
unions. Dissatisfied workers who
understand their oppression are
labeled as troublemakers, isolated
from other workers, told not to
talk to students and threatened
with firing. They are played off
against each other with small wage
differences and are rewarded for
spying and tattling on their fellow
workers.
Promotions are granted not by
experience and qualification but
by favoritism and loyalty to the
white southern female
$ 1 5,000/ year executive
administrator. Housekeeping
employees are excluded from
education and decision making
processes. Spanish speaking
workers are often given directions
in pantomine because there are no
Spanish speaking supervisors. The
specific incident that united the
workers was the promotion of
two white newcomers to
supervisory positions over Black
oldtimers with 10 years
experience. Just two weeks earlier
the whites were assigned as
assistants to the blacks.
The job description for a
medical center janitor is
exquisitely exhaustive:
b) Employee maintains his assigned
area according to established
housekeeping standards, which
include:
1) Floor care: Sweeping, dust
mopping, wet mopping,
semi-stripping, waxing, buffing, base
board cleaning and spot and spillage
removal.
2) Bathroom and Shower stall care,
toilet bowl, wash basins, showers,
shower walls, changing shower
curtains, polishing chrome, floor
care, wall washing, spot washing
walls, trash removal, cleaning trash
containers, replenishing toilet tissue,
paper towels, soap, and periodic
policing.
3) Miscellaneous duties such as:
window washing, cleaning window

screens, washing and polishing
furniture, wall washing, washing
glass doors and mirrors, dusting,
washing wood work and cabinets.
c) Delivery of clean linen to using
areas and returns empty linen carts to
Linen Room.
d) Reports to his Supervisor needed
minor repairs to building and
equipment; maintains housekeeping
equipment by careful use, frequent
cleaning and proper storage. Uses
supplies and materials as directed,
safeguards materials by proper storage.
e) Performs related duties as

employees are excluded from

workers was the promotion of

The job description for a
medical center janitor is
exquisitely exhaustive:
b) Employee maintains his assigned
area according to established
housekeeping standards, which
include:
1) Floor care: Sweeping, dust
mopping, wet mopping,
semi-stripping, waxing, buffing, base
board cleaning and spot and spillage
removal.
2) Bathroom and Shower stall care,
toilet bowl, wash basins, showers,
shower walls, changing shower
curtains, polishing chrome, floor
care, wall washing, spot washing
walls, trash removal, cleaning trash
containers, replenishing toilet tissue,
paper towels, soap, and periodic
policing.
3) Miscellaneous duties such as:
window washing, cleaning window

screens, washing and polishing
furniture, wall washing, washing
glass doors and mirrors, dusting,
washing wood work and cabinets.
c) Delivery of clean linen to using
areas and returns empty linen carts to
Linen Room.
d) Reports to his Supervisor needed
minor repairs to building and
equipment; maintains housekeeping
equipment by careful use, frequent
cleaning and proper storage. Uses
supplies and materials as directed,
safeguards materials by proper storage.
e) Performs related duties as
assigned by Supervisors such as:
1) Furniture moving, set-ups for
special meetings, isolation or
contamination cleaning, assisting
with emergencies.
Representatives from the
janitorial and maid services who
formulated the demands two
weeks ago have met twice since
then with hospital administrators.
The liberal director of the
hospital, Dr. Thomas Gonda,
Professor of Psychiatry, has said
he agrees with all the demands
and "wants to see more of this
kind of thing." There has been no
action taken by the hospital
administration to implement any
of the demands so far. It is felt
that some of the problems can be
worked out internally. But if the
demand for living wages cannot be
met by reallocating money with
the present Medical Center budget
then it is likely that the Stanford
Board of Trustees would have to
act—and Judge Ben Duniway says
the Trustees don't have much
power. And Big Bill Hewlett
doesn't make nerve gas.
A final point: Stanford Medical
Center's dealings with its
housekeeping workers parallel its
medical dealings with the black
community. There are
documented cases of East Palo
Alto residents being sent away
from the Emergency Room
because of insufficient
funds—several children with high
fevers are known to have been
sent to the County Hospital
without being seen by a physician.
Stanford Medical Center has
always been more willing to
Research communities like East
Palo Alto and East Menlo Park
than to serve their needs.

Stanford, like all capitalist
institutions, has long used the
black community as a large source
of cheap labor. The fortune that
built Stanford University was
amassed by the brutal
exploitation of Chinese laborers
by Leland Stanford. The Trustees
who rule Stanford today also
direct corporations that make
huge profits by exploiting workers
and resources at home and in the
third world. These men also serve
as directors or members of
organizations like Stanford
Research Institute, Hoover
Institution and Council on
Foreign Relations which are
designed to maintain and expand
their corporate wealth and power.
The Housekeeping Department
at Stanford University Hospital
employs about 160 workers,
mostly Black people from East
Palo Alto. The workers see
Stanford Hospital as a leading
institution that assumes power for
setting salary and working
condition guidelines that
determine what other hospitals
will offer. These workers are now
uniting behind a set of demands
that, when met, will improve the
lives of hospital workers and their
families in the whole Bay Area if
not the whole West.
The demands are as follows:
I. We want a Workers
Association recognized by
Stanford University Hospital as
the representative of the best
interest of the housekeeping
workers.
11. We want a living wage
necessary to survive in the
community we live in.
111. We want our true take
home pay and raise schedule

clearly stated at the beginning of
our job.
IV. We want job security and
the opportunity for education and
advancement for other types of
hospital work.
V. We want a clear description
of the regular duties of the janitor
separate from wall washer and
floor stripers and other higher
salaried jobs.
VI. We want an end to
favoritism, mental cruelty, and
inhumane working conditions.
VII. We want to be able to
work without our supervisors and
their fellow eyes spying on us,
reporting on us and breathing
down our backs.
VIII. We want fair rules on
lateness that apply equally to
everyone, and one person chosen
by their fellow workers to mark
the late and tardiness book.
IX. We want longer breaks and
a full Lunch Hour.
X. We want fully insured,
comprehensive outpatient and
inpatient health care for hospital
workers and their family.
XI. We want uniforms
furnished and laundered by the
hospital.
XII. We want the executive
supervisor to meet monthly with
the employees, to be better
acquainted with the workers and
to spend more time at the hospital
devoted to improving the
conditions of the workers.
XIII. We want a fair hearing
with legal counsel before being
terminated from the job.
XIV. We want our supervisors
responsible to the workers and
capable of communicating with
them and therefore they must be
elected by their fellow workers to
insure this.
Yesterday the workers in the

Housekeeping Department met
and all but a handful voted to
support the formation of the
Workers Association.
A support statement has been
circulated at the Medical Center
and has been signed by 300
non-housekeeping employees so
far. It reads
"To meet demands of a rising cost of
living and general lack of concern, the
members of housekeeping and maid
service have asked the hospital and
medical school to reevaluate wages and
working conditions for members of
their departments. These departments
are largely composed of minority
people (Black, Mexican-American etc.)
Throughout the growth of this
hospital and medical school center, the
needs of these people have been
consistently overlooked. They are now
asking that their fellow employees (lab
technicians, nurses, doctors etc.) show
their concern over the lack of attention
their problems have received."
Janitors have take home pay of
about $310 per month, and it is
common for men to hold two jobs
and work 16 hours per day. In
regard to their request for a salary
increase, workers sent the
following explanation to the
hospital administrator:
"If an increase is in any measure to
relieve the financial pressure we are
now subject to, it must be sufficiently
substantial to provide a "take home"
check that would accomplish the
following:
1) Preclude the necessity of
working two jobs which would allow
us time to adequately function as a
"Father figure" in the home, and to
provide time for rest and relaxation.
2) Permit the mothers of the
household to stay in the home and
provide guidance and care for the
children.
3) Adequately meet living expense

at today's inflated prices.
4) Have sufficient funds to keep
our communis from being called,
slum."
Because Housekeeping jobs are
the least skilled, they are
individually expendable and most
liable to exploitation and
intimidation; but their function as
a unit is indispensible. They are
told they are here at the good will

effort is made to prevent them
from forming collectives or

understand their oppression are
labeled as troublemakers, isolated

talk to students and threatened
with firing. They are played off
against each other with small wage
differences and are rewarded for
spying and tattling on their fellow
workers.
Promotions are granted not by
experience and qualification but
by favoritism and loyalty to the

employees are excluded from

responsible to the workers and
capable of communicating with
them and therefore they must be
elected by their fellow workers to
insure this.
Yesterday the workers in the

Housekeeping Department met
and all but a handful voted to
support the formation of the
Workers Association.
A support statement has been
circulated at the Medical Center
and has been signed by 300
non-housekeeping employees so
far. It reads
"To meet demands of a rising cost of
living and general lack of concern, the
members of housekeeping and maid
service have asked the hospital and
medical school to reevaluate wages and
working conditions for members of
their departments. These departments
are largely composed of minority
people (Black, Mexican-American etc.)
Throughout the growth of this
hospital and medical school center, the
needs of these people have been
consistently overlooked. They are now
asking that their fellow employees (lab
technicians, nurses, doctors etc.) show
their concern over the lack of attention
their problems have received."
Janitors have take home pay of
about $310 per month, and it is
common for men to hold two jobs
and work 16 hours per day. In
regard to their request for a salary
increase, workers sent the
following explanation to the
hospital administrator:
"If an increase is in any measure to
relieve the financial pressure we are
now subject to, it must be sufficiently
substantial to provide a "take home"
check that would accomplish the
following:
1) Preclude the necessity of
working two jobs which would allow
us time to adequately function as a
"Father figure" in the home, and to
provide time for rest and relaxation.
2) Permit the mothers of the
household to stay in the home and
provide guidance and care for the
children.
3) Adequately meet living expense

at today's inflated prices.
4) Have sufficient funds to keep
our communis from being called,
slum."
Because Housekeeping jobs are
the least skilled, they are
individually expendable and most
liable to exploitation and
intimidation; but their function as
a unit is indispensible. They are
told they are here at the good will
of Stanford University and every
effort is made to prevent them
from forming collectives or
unions. Dissatisfied workers who
understand their oppression are
labeled as troublemakers, isolated
from other workers, told not to
talk to students and threatened
with firing. They are played off
against each other with small wage
differences and are rewarded for
spying and tattling on their fellow
workers.
Promotions are granted not by
experience and qualification but
by favoritism and loyalty to the
white southern female
$ 1 5,000/ year executive
administrator. Housekeeping
employees are excluded from
education and decision making
processes. Spanish speaking
workers are often given directions
in pantomine because there are no
Spanish speaking supervisors. The
specific incident that united the
workers was the promotion of
two white newcomers to
supervisory positions over Black
oldtimers with 10 years
experience. Just two weeks earlier
the whites were assigned as
assistants to the blacks.
The job description for a
medical center janitor is
exquisitely exhaustive:
b) Employee maintains his assigned
area according to established
housekeeping standards, which
include:
1) Floor care: Sweeping, dust
mopping, wet mopping,
semi-stripping, waxing, buffing, base
board cleaning and spot and spillage
removal.
2) Bathroom and Shower stall care,
toilet bowl, wash basins, showers,
shower walls, changing shower
curtains, polishing chrome, floor
care, wall washing, spot washing
walls, trash removal, cleaning trash
containers, replenishing toilet tissue,
paper towels, soap, and periodic
policing.
3) Miscellaneous duties such as:
window washing, cleaning window

screens, washing and polishing
furniture, wall washing, washing
glass doors and mirrors, dusting,
washing wood work and cabinets.
c) Delivery of clean linen to using
areas and returns empty linen carts to
Linen Room.
d) Reports to his Supervisor needed
minor repairs to building and
equipment; maintains housekeeping
equipment by careful use, frequent
cleaning and proper storage. Uses
supplies and materials as directed,
safeguards materials by proper storage.
e) Performs related duties as
assigned by Supervisors such as:
1) Furniture moving, set-ups for
special meetings, isolation or
contamination cleaning, assisting
with emergencies.
Representatives from the
janitorial and maid services who
formulated the demands two
weeks ago have met twice since
then with hospital administrators.
The liberal director of the
hospital, Dr. Thomas Gonda,
Professor of Psychiatry, has said
he agrees with all the demands
and "wants to see more of this
kind of thing." There has been no
action taken by the hospital
administration to implement any
of the demands so far. It is felt
that some of the problems can be
worked out internally. But if the
demand for living wages cannot be
met by reallocating money with
the present Medical Center budget
then it is likely that the Stanford
Board of Trustees would have to
act—and Judge Ben Duniway says
the Trustees don't have much
power. And Big Bill Hewlett
doesn't make nerve gas.
A final point: Stanford Medical
Center's dealings with its
housekeeping workers parallel its
medical dealings with the black
community. There are
documented cases of East Palo
Alto residents being sent away
from the Emergency Room
because of insufficient
funds—several children with high
fevers are known to have been
sent to the County Hospital
without being seen by a physician.
Stanford Medical Center has
always been more willing to
Research communities like East
Palo Alto and East Menlo Park
than to serve their needs.
(Edward Bernstein is a fifth
year Medical Student. Bernard
Greenfield is a third year Medical
student- Ed.)
Stanford, like all capitalist
institutions, has long used the
black community as a large source
of cheap labor. The fortune that
built Stanford University was
amassed by the brutal
exploitation of Chinese laborers
by Leland Stanford. The Trustees
who rule Stanford today also
direct corporations that make
huge profits by exploiting workers
and resources at home and in the
third world. These men also serve
as directors or members of
organizations like Stanford
Research Institute, Hoover
Institution and Council on
Foreign Relations which are
designed to maintain and expand
their corporate wealth and power.
The Housekeeping Department
at Stanford University Hospital
employs about 160 workers,
mostly Black people from East
Palo Alto. The workers see
Stanford Hospital as a leading
institution that assumes power for
setting salary and working
condition guidelines that
determine what other hospitals
will offer. These workers are now
uniting behind a set of demands
that, when met, will improve the
lives of hospital workers and their
families in the whole Bay Area if
not the whole West.
The demands are as follows:
I. We want a Workers
Association recognized by
Stanford University Hospital as
the representative of the best
interest of the housekeeping
workers.
11. We want a living wage
necessary to survive in the
community we live in.
111. We want our true take
home pay and raise schedule

clearly stated at the beginning of
our job.
IV. We want job security and
the opportunity for education and
advancement for other types of
hospital work.
V. We want a clear description
of the regular duties of the janitor
separate from wall washer and
floor stripers and other higher
salaried jobs.
VI. We want an end to
favoritism, mental cruelty, and
inhumane working conditions.
VII. We want to be able to
work without our supervisors and
their fellow eyes spying on us,
reporting on us and breathing
down our backs.
VIII. We want fair rules on
lateness that apply equally to
everyone, and one person chosen
by their fellow workers to mark
the late and tardiness book.
IX. We want longer breaks and
a full Lunch Hour.
X. We want fully insured,
comprehensive outpatient and
inpatient health care for hospital
workers and their family.
XI. We want uniforms
furnished and laundered by the
hospital.
XII. We want the executive
supervisor to meet monthly with
the employees, to be better
acquainted with the workers and
to spend more time at the hospital
devoted to improving the
conditions of the workers.
XIII. We want a fair hearing
with legal counsel before being
terminated from the job.
XIV. We want our supervisors
responsible to the workers and
capable of communicating with
them and therefore they must be
elected by their fellow workers to
insure this.
