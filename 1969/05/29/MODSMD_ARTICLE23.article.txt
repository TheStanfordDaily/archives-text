## Cuba Teaches Lesson 
### Rigino Perez 
In yesterday's Daily Jeff Weil
rightfully complains about the
growing dehumanization within
the A3M and some of the circular
logic that is used by SDS
sympathizers. He begins by
justifying revolution under some
conditions but not others. He uses
the example of Cuba and states
that before the Cuban Revolution
(1) 80 per cent of the people were
living on starvation wages; (2)
Only those who could afford a
doctor could get medical
attention; (3) illiteracy was the
rule and; (4) racism kept even
Batista (a mulatto) off the beach
of the Havana Biltmore.
The first statement that 80 per
cent of the people lived on
starvation wages is definitely not
true. From the International
Labor Organization we learn that
in 1958 Cuba, with 66.6 percent,
ranked 4th in the world in highest
distribution of gross national
product as compensation to labor.
Furthermore, the food
comsumption per capita has
actually gone down in 11 years of
revolutionary rule. The allusion to
an 80c salary per day is strange in
view of the fact that "Every
worker shall by guaranteed a
minimum wage or salary (Article
6 I)'' — from the Cuban
Constitution of 1940—which in
1958 was $3.00 per day. If Mr.
Weil would like further facts on
this point, I will gladly supply him
with any facts at my disposal. In
general it seems that 80 per cent
of the population was NOT living
on "starvation wages." In any
case, the Revolution has not
improved on this.
Under the 1940 Constitution, a
system of socialized medicine was
established with doctors and
medical stations (casas de socorro)
in all urban centers by
neighborhood. These were FREE.
Every doctor in Cuba was
required to put in a certain
number of hours per week at
these local centers. Let us not
forget that in 1959 Cuba ranked
third in Latin America in the
number of physicians per capita.
At the University of Havana, the
medical degree required seven
years of study. Under the
revolutionary government today
the "new man" is a full-fledged
M.D. in two years. If you add to
this the exodus of doctors from
their homeland due to the loss of
freedom, it is difficult to explain
how medical care could have
improved. Popular Hygiene has
improved since the revolution, but
this was true of Germany under
Hitler and Italy under Mussolini.
A ruthless dictatorship is more
efficient in enforcing all laws,
hygenic or political. There is strict
gun control in Chechoslovakia, no
doubt about it!
The implication that Cuba was
illiterate is again not true.
Actually Cuba had 22.1 per cent
illiteracy, which compared well to
1962 figures published by the
Miami Herald on April 12th of
that year indicate the State of
Florida had 8-10 per cent
illiteracy and eleven Southern
states plus Hawaii had an illiteracy
rate of from 15.3 to 24.9 per
cent.
The final allegation that racism
was the rule in a country where
26.54 per cent of the population
was black is ridiculous. Batista
may not have bathed at the
Havana Biltmore for fear of
assassination (he was a member of

this club), but believe me this fear
was not for racial reasons.
To quote from the November
1962 Report on Cuba and the
Rule of Law by the International
Commission of Jurists in Geneva,
concerning the pre-revolutionary
Cuban economy: "The Cuban
economy, far from being on the
brink of ruin, was developing
rapidly . . .the main obstacles to
even faster economic development
were administrative dishonesty
and political illegality."
To eradicate the
"administrative dishonesty and
political illegality" which the
Jurists report as Cuba's great
malady, the Cuban people—not
just Fidel Castro—revolted against
the dictatorship of Batista, who
shamefully disrupted the normal
democratic processes by a coup
d'etat on March 10, 1952, less
than ninety days before a general
election in which he was a
candidate, albeit without any
possibility of being elected. The
revolt against Batista was strictly
political and nationalist, NOT
economic, and was prompted by a
desire to restore democracy and
rule of law, not tyranny. The
trade-off of dictators was not the
goal for which so many gave their
lives.
As for Fidel's generosity to his
enemies, I suggest you tell that
anecdote to my compatriots who
were machine-gunned down on
BRITISH soil in Cayo Sal, a small
Key off Cuba, while trying to flee
your communist paradise several
years ago.
Finally, as a last comment, I
would say that the lesson to be
learned from all this is that
idealists and reformers should
seek to educate, not eradicate.
The former leads to lasting

changes, and free consciences; the
latter leads not to liberation from
tyranny but substitution of labels.
