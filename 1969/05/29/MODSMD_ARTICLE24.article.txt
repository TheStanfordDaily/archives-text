"That deaf dumb and blind kid sure
plays a mean pin baII."—TOMMY, the
Who
A chick friend of mine had a
dream. She really digs Mick
Jagger, and she dreamed she was
with him, starting to fall in love.
Everything went fine until it
came time for them to touch.
Then she reached out for him and
found that he was only two feet
tall. She woke up very unhappy.
But what do you expect? I
mean we all know Mick Jagger's
voice and his image pretty well.
We might be able to talk about
him (or Lyndon Johnson or
Richard Nixon) for longer than
we could talk about most of our
friends. But are we sure he's not
just two feet tall?
He's an idol. He's a figure in
our head that we can dream about
just like real people. But we may
only look, we just cannot touch.
Idolatry is a fascinating
subject, of late. Erich Fromm and
Marshall McLuhan have both
written about it. Remember the
biblical thing, about having eyes
but not seeing, ears but not
hearing? How about having status
symbols but no status, an I.Q. but
no wisdom, a big income but

nothing of value. Call it
alienation—defining one's self by
artificial standards—and you have
part of it.
Another part of it is
metaphysical. The tree of good
and evil, the tower of Babel. To
name it is to numb it. The longer
you keep from naming something,
the better you get to know it.
Why is it that people get along
so poorly? More and more it
seems to be that the basic mistake
is that people cannot see beyond
their own expectations of what a
person should be to what they
are. People want to be loved, not
idolized. "See me, feel me, Touch
me, heal me."
On a political level, this means
that flowers should not be rooted
out of a beautiful place because
that place is a "piece of private
property." The articifial
definition of it is consuming its
being. What was that old
Sandburg poem?
"Get off my land!"
"Why is this your land?"
"My father owned it."
"How did he get it?"
"He fought for it."
"All right, I'll fight you for it."
Another part of it is

intellectual. "Tommy doesn't
know what day it is. Doesn't
know who Jesus was or what
praying is. How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave." Damn it,
it doesn't matter what day it is.
Or how old it is. Or how tall it is.
The caterpillar was only three
inches high, and that was high
enough to turn him into a
butterfly.
"It really doesn't matter if I'm
wrong, I'm right where I belong,
I'm right where I belong." To
know him is not to love him. To
love him is to know him.
But how can you know each
other if you keep playing pinball?
Talking about you and me and the
games people play. Well, if you
can eliminate the distractions
(being blind, deaf, and dumb
helps) you may do pretty well,
especially on your own machine.
But some of us get ionely.
You make an idol so you can
manipulate it. You put it on a
pedestal so that you will know
where to find it. "But tied to that
chair you won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak."
Nobody wants to be idolized.
Dylan sang to the landlord, "If
you won't underestimate me, I
won't underestimate you." Over,
under, sideways, down. Don't
estimate people at all. You aren't
going anywhere.
People are fighting and dying
right now because other people
will not recognize their humanity.
Sure, they are making the same
mistake when they start to define,
stereotype, use. In their own
infinitely fallable, human way
they are trying to make us see
that their life is not all-important
to them unless they can have
some reality, some human feeling
instead of looking at their
idol-selves from the outside
monitor called thinking. Thing
king.
''I'm 112 ree—l'm free. And
freedom tastes of reality." Free
from what? Free to what? Free to
be to see. To see what? Siddartha
had a friend who kept looking for
the reality beyond, who never saw
what was right in front of him.
"Why wait any longer for the
world to begin, you can have your
cake and eat it too. Why wait any
longer for the one you love when
he's standing in front of you?"
This column is a review of a
new record, Tommy, by the Who.
If you ever dug this column
enough to think my opinion was
worth something, go out and buy
the record. Try to be happy.
"Listening lo you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!
Hight behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory.
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story."

plays a mean pin baII."—TOMMY, the
Who
A chick friend of mine had a
dream. She really digs Mick
Jagger, and she dreamed she was
with him, starting to fall in love.
Everything went fine until it
came time for them to touch.
Then she reached out for him and
found that he was only two feet
tall. She woke up very unhappy.
But what do you expect? I
mean we all know Mick Jagger's
voice and his image pretty well.
We might be able to talk about
him (or Lyndon Johnson or
Richard Nixon) for longer than
we could talk about most of our
friends. But are we sure he's not
just two feet tall?
He's an idol. He's a figure in
our head that we can dream about
just like real people. But we may
only look, we just cannot touch.
Idolatry is a fascinating
subject, of late. Erich Fromm and
Marshall McLuhan have both
written about it. Remember the
biblical thing, about having eyes
but not seeing, ears but not
hearing? How about having status
symbols but no status, an I.Q. but
no wisdom, a big income but

nothing of value. Call it
alienation—defining one's self by
artificial standards—and you have
part of it.
Another part of it is
metaphysical. The tree of good
and evil, the tower of Babel. To
name it is to numb it. The longer
you keep from naming something,
the better you get to know it.
Why is it that people get along
so poorly? More and more it
seems to be that the basic mistake
is that people cannot see beyond
their own expectations of what a
person should be to what they
are. People want to be loved, not
idolized. "See me, feel me, Touch
me, heal me."
On a political level, this means
that flowers should not be rooted
out of a beautiful place because
that place is a "piece of private
property." The articifial
definition of it is consuming its
being. What was that old
Sandburg poem?
"Get off my land!"
"Why is this your land?"
"My father owned it."
"How did he get it?"
"He fought for it."
"All right, I'll fight you for it."
Another part of it is

intellectual. "Tommy doesn't
know what day it is. Doesn't
know who Jesus was or what
praying is. How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave." Damn it,
it doesn't matter what day it is.
Or how old it is. Or how tall it is.
The caterpillar was only three
inches high, and that was high
enough to turn him into a
butterfly.
"It really doesn't matter if I'm
wrong, I'm right where I belong,
I'm right where I belong." To
know him is not to love him. To
love him is to know him.
But how can you know each
other if you keep playing pinball?
Talking about you and me and the
games people play. Well, if you
can eliminate the distractions
(being blind, deaf, and dumb
helps) you may do pretty well,
especially on your own machine.
But some of us get ionely.
You make an idol so you can
manipulate it. You put it on a
pedestal so that you will know
where to find it. "But tied to that
chair you won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak."
Nobody wants to be idolized.
Dylan sang to the landlord, "If
you won't underestimate me, I
won't underestimate you." Over,
under, sideways, down. Don't
estimate people at all. You aren't
going anywhere.
People are fighting and dying
right now because other people
will not recognize their humanity.
Sure, they are making the same
mistake when they start to define,
stereotype, use. In their own
infinitely fallable, human way
they are trying to make us see
that their life is not all-important
to them unless they can have
some reality, some human feeling
instead of looking at their
idol-selves from the outside
monitor called thinking. Thing
king.
''I'm 112 ree—l'm free. And
freedom tastes of reality." Free
from what? Free to what? Free to
be to see. To see what? Siddartha
had a friend who kept looking for
the reality beyond, who never saw
what was right in front of him.
"Why wait any longer for the
world to begin, you can have your
cake and eat it too. Why wait any
longer for the one you love when
he's standing in front of you?"
This column is a review of a
new record, Tommy, by the Who.
If you ever dug this column
enough to think my opinion was
worth something, go out and buy
the record. Try to be happy.
"Listening lo you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!
Hight behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory.
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story."

dream. She really digs Mick
Jagger, and she dreamed she was
with him, starting to fall in love.
Everything went fine until it
came time for them to touch.
Then she reached out for him and
found that he was only two feet
tall. She woke up very unhappy.
But what do you expect? I
mean we all know Mick Jagger's
voice and his image pretty well.
We might be able to talk about
him (or Lyndon Johnson or
Richard Nixon) for longer than
we could talk about most of our
friends. But are we sure he's not
just two feet tall?
He's an idol. He's a figure in
our head that we can dream about
just like real people. But we may
only look, we just cannot touch.
Idolatry is a fascinating
subject, of late. Erich Fromm and
Marshall McLuhan have both
written about it. Remember the
biblical thing, about having eyes
but not seeing, ears but not
hearing? How about having status
symbols but no status, an I.Q. but
no wisdom, a big income but

nothing of value. Call it
alienation—defining one's self by
artificial standards—and you have
part of it.
Another part of it is
metaphysical. The tree of good
and evil, the tower of Babel. To
name it is to numb it. The longer
you keep from naming something,
the better you get to know it.
Why is it that people get along
so poorly? More and more it
seems to be that the basic mistake
is that people cannot see beyond
their own expectations of what a
person should be to what they
are. People want to be loved, not
idolized. "See me, feel me, Touch
me, heal me."
On a political level, this means
that flowers should not be rooted
out of a beautiful place because
that place is a "piece of private
property." The articifial
definition of it is consuming its
being. What was that old
Sandburg poem?
"Get off my land!"
"Why is this your land?"
"My father owned it."
"How did he get it?"
"He fought for it."
"All right, I'll fight you for it."
Another part of it is

intellectual. "Tommy doesn't
know what day it is. Doesn't
know who Jesus was or what
praying is. How can he be saved?
From the eternal grave." Damn it,
it doesn't matter what day it is.
Or how old it is. Or how tall it is.
The caterpillar was only three
inches high, and that was high
enough to turn him into a
butterfly.
"It really doesn't matter if I'm
wrong, I'm right where I belong,
I'm right where I belong." To
know him is not to love him. To
love him is to know him.
But how can you know each
other if you keep playing pinball?
Talking about you and me and the
games people play. Well, if you
can eliminate the distractions
(being blind, deaf, and dumb
helps) you may do pretty well,
especially on your own machine.
But some of us get ionely.
You make an idol so you can
manipulate it. You put it on a
pedestal so that you will know
where to find it. "But tied to that
chair you won't go anywhere.
There's a lot I can do to a freak."
Nobody wants to be idolized.
Dylan sang to the landlord, "If
you won't underestimate me, I
won't underestimate you." Over,
under, sideways, down. Don't
estimate people at all. You aren't
going anywhere.
People are fighting and dying
right now because other people
will not recognize their humanity.
Sure, they are making the same
mistake when they start to define,
stereotype, use. In their own
infinitely fallable, human way
they are trying to make us see
that their life is not all-important
to them unless they can have
some reality, some human feeling
instead of looking at their
idol-selves from the outside
monitor called thinking. Thing
king.
''I'm 112 ree—l'm free. And
freedom tastes of reality." Free
from what? Free to what? Free to
be to see. To see what? Siddartha
had a friend who kept looking for
the reality beyond, who never saw
what was right in front of him.
"Why wait any longer for the
world to begin, you can have your
cake and eat it too. Why wait any
longer for the one you love when
he's standing in front of you?"
This column is a review of a
new record, Tommy, by the Who.
If you ever dug this column
enough to think my opinion was
worth something, go out and buy
the record. Try to be happy.
"Listening lo you I get the music.
Gazing at you I get the heat
Following you I climb the mountain
I get excitement at your feet!
Hight behind you I see the millions
On you I see the glory.
From you I get opinions
From you I get the story."
