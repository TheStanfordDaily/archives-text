SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-Erik
Whitehorn, youngest of two
brothers convicted of failure to
register for the draft, was
sentenced today to an
indeterminate term in prison by a
judge who called his crime
politically motivated.
Erik, 18, resides at 3931
Duncan Place, Palo Alto, with his
mother, Mrs. Evelyn Whitehorn,
who unsuccessfully has contended
she should be tried instead of her
son because she was refusing to let
him refister for the draft.
Visiting U.S. District Judge,
Gus Solomon of Portland Ore.,
said, "This is the first case that
I've ever tried where I thought the
motivation was political."
Whitehorn was turned over to
the U.S. marshal. Judge Solomon
denied bail and said an appeal in
the case would have "no merit
and is frivolous."
The judge said an appeal under
the Youth Corrections Act could
be made but added "to allow Erik
Whitehorn and others to
determine what laws they should
obey would create chaos."
The youth's mother, Mrs.
Evelyn Whitehorn, broke out in
sobs when Solomon passed

sentence and was cojnforted by an
older son, Robert, 22, who was
earlier convicted of the same
charge. He faces sentencing here

Defense lawyer Paul Maie
argued in his appeal for probation
that Whitehorn's crime "doesn't
harm anyone."
Solomon retorted, "What do
you mean, it doesn't hurt anyone?
When this boy doesn't go, they
take another boy; isn't that true?"
The judge said, "In my many
years of trying cases like this I
have never seen a boy who wasn't
sincere."
However, in Whitehorn's case,
Solomon noted the youth had
taken part in an antidraft
demonstration in Oakland when
only 16.
Solomon also said there was
ample evidence to show Mrs.
Whitehorn had handled much of
her son's case and at times had
handed out press releases
Mrs. Whitehorn on two
occasions tried to have the charge
against her son dropped. She
contended that Erik was only
following her teachings and since
he was a minor she should be tried
in his palce.
