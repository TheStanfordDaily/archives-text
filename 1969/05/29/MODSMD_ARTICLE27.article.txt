# Ram's Head Plans Next Year's Gaieties
## 
### 
Although Gaieties was
cancelled from this year's Big
Game Week events, Ram's Head,
the musical's producers, are
already planning for next year's
show.
Due to production difficulties
this year, Ram's Head was unable
to stage the traditionally original
production. "A Funny Thing
Happened on the Way to the
Forum" was performed instead.
Gaieties in past years has
gained national recognition. Alan
Mokler and Gary Levinson
received first place from the
Broadcast Music Inc., Variety
Show Competition for their 1967
show "Wumberlogue."
The script for '69 Gaieties, as
yet unfinished, is to be a satirical
musical and like "Wumberlogue"
will not deal with the
Stanford-Cal Big Game rivalry.

Included in this year's Ram's
Head productions were Paul
Foster's controversial "Tom
Paine" and a musical comedy
taken from Fielding's bawdy play,
"Rape Upon Rape," entitled
"Lock Up Your Daughters."
Gaieties is a special tradition
and involves the most student
"spirit" of any dramatic
presentation on campus. Not only
those who are in the spotlights,
but the stagehands, costume
designers, orchestra members and
soft-drink fetchers, are an integral
part of Ram's Head contribution
to Big Game Week.
The next casting will take place
the first fcjw days of Fall Quarter.
In the meantime, anyone
interested in any capacity of the
show, from acting to painting sets,
designing or directing, is requested
to call producer Lee Jordan,
328-3445.
