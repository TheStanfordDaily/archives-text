# Anti-ABM
## 
### 
The Stanford Community
Against the ABM will meet
tonight at 9 p.m., rather than 8
p.m. as previously announced to
avoid conflict with the panel
discussion of McCarthyism and
the Senate subpoena.
The meeting, in the ASSU
office, will discuss plans for
out-of-state newspaper ads against
the ABM and be followed by a
short meeting of the Committee
for New Politics.
