# W. Arroyo Counters Political Repression
## 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY: *
We, Wilbur Arroyo, are writing this letter to protest the blatant
political repression which has been directed against us this quarter. Not
only have we been enjoined from occupying any University buildings,
but we are consequently being investigated by the U.S. Senate.
We have reason to believe that this is a conspiracy perpetrated by the
Dean of Students office and in particular by the Asst. Dean of Students
in charge of housing, Bob Rosch. An unreasonably large number of
Wilbur Arroyo have been exiled to Florence Moore, which has been
kept homesexual for the express purpose of repressing us politically. It
is merely coincidental that the above mentioned Dean in charge of
housing was responsible for placing our name on the injunction? We
find this hard to believe.
In light of these facts we make the following non-negotiable
demands: 1) a trial by the SJC for our involvement in Encina Hall;
2) the right to thoroughly examine the contents of our file before it is
sent to the Senate Investigating Committee; 3) that Florence Moore be
made coeducational by next fall (this is to allow adequate time for
rational intercourse) and we specifically request the aid of our sister
Sally Mahoney in liberating Florence.
If these demands are not met we will take the necessary steps for
their implementation. We are dedicated to the principle of non-violence
but we have friends . . .
