# LASSU Adjourns Meeting Without Approving Budget
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The Stanford student legislature
(LASSU) made more progress than
it had in previous sessions toward
approving a budget last night but a
call for a quorum adjourned the last
meeting of the year and left the
student body without a budget.
The legislature had one more
possible night to call a meeting, but
because ASSU president Denis
Hayes has called a community
meeting tonight in Cubberley
Auditorium the legislature did not
schedule a meeting.
The purpose of tonight's
community meeting at 7:30 will be
to discuss the subpoena the
University received from the U.S.
Senate Permanent Subcommittee
on Investigations.
Provost Lyman spoke before the
student legislature last night about
the issue (see story on page one).,
Appropriations Made
Last night the legislature did
manage to hammer out
appropriations to the ASSU Office,
to the Art Board, the Election
Board, the Axe Committee,
Cardinals Board and eventually to
Pre-Reg, but the money cannot be
allocated without approval of the
entire budget. The failure of the
legislature to do this leaves the
entire budget up to the scrutiny
and consideration of next year's
trimmed-down legislature.
According to speaker Yale
Braunstein activities for the
summer are covered by the current
budget. However Pre-reg and some
of the early football games could be
in trouble without any money to
operate on.
Braunstein said that "we are
hoping we can borrow money from
the University without budget to
finance Pre-reg and the cheerleaders

with the hope a full budget would
be approved by early October.
Preliminary negotiations have
already started."
Final adjournment of the
meeting last night came after an
initial quorum call apparently had
closed the meeting five minutes
before.
That initial call came from
representative Paul Witt after the
legislature refused to consider two
resolutions he wished to introduce.
Moments after the meeting had
been adjourned Witt asked that
another meeting be called. The
body which was milling around the
room confusedly decided to |
reconvene, only to be adjourned
moments later.
Asks Resignations
Witt originally wanted
consideration of a resolution asking
that the Board of Trustees submit
their immediate resignations
because of their "lack of
understanding of the events on
campus and of the mood of the
community." His second resolution
requested that President Pitzer not
release any information to
governmental inquest bodies.
The meeting convened long j
enough to approve the Pre-reg j
appropriation, but when the |
motion was made to reconsider the j
Election commission appropriation
which had been approved hours
earlier, Ben Wooten, chairman of
the finance committee, called for
another quorum.
That ended the meeting and
LASSU for good.
Said Wooten quoting Oliver
Cromwell after the meeting, "It is
not fit that you should sit as a
Parliament any longer. You have sat
long enough unless you had done
more good."
