# New Overseas Requirements Set
## 
### GREG WHITE 
The General Studies
Subcommittee on Overseas
Campuses has instituted special
requirements for all students
planning to go overseas. The
subcommittee, which is composed
of four student and five faculty
members, reached this decision
after a review of the whole
orientation of those students
selected to go overseas.
The major change in the
program has to do with
academics. The subcommittee
believes that involvement in
appropriate academic work is the
most effective preparation for a
fruitful stay overseas. Therefore,
each student will be required to
either: 1) Satisfactorily complete
a course chosen from a
subcommittee approved list. The
course, which may be taken
pass-fail if so offered, must be
taken before departure.
2) If a student can't or doesn't
want to take one of these courses,
he may read material from a list
which will be supplied after
consultation with the academic

directors at each campus. The
student must then pass an
examination based on the reading.
No academic credit is given for
this alternative. 3) In special cases
a student may enlist a faculty
sponsor to back an independent
study program relevant to the
campus to be attended.
Other changes in the
orientation program deal with
non-academic matters.
Administrative meetings will be
held to a minimum, in fact the
number of required meetings is
being cut in half. Meetings will be
continued on the Monday
afternoon meeting time.
Also, a more extensive number
of voluntary gatherings will be
organized, mainly by the Overseas
Campuses Board, in hopes that
students in each group will
become better acquainted with
themselves and their faculty
families before they go overseas.
The new orientation program is
scheduled to go into operation in
the Fall quarter, 1969. Students
with questions should contact the
Overseas Campus Board.
