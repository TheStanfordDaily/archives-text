Stanford's Department of
Music and ALEA 11, a
contemporary music group, will
present a number of free concerts
during the coming week.
The programs range from
Medieval vocal music and Bach
Concerto's to multi-media pieces
involving theatrical devices,
electronic tapes, and light
profections.
Chamber Music Concerts
The Department of Music is
dedicating its final two chamber
music concerts of the season to
retiring Prof. Putnam Aldrich.
A concert of cantatas and
concerti will be presented at 8:30
p.m., Friday, May 30, and a
concert of music for winds and
harpsichord at 8:30 p.m.
Saturday, May 31. Both concerts
will be in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
There is no admission charge.
A featured work at Friday's
concert will be a new
composition, "Pater Noster,"
written for the occasion by Daniel
Pinkham, a former pupil of Prof.
Aldrich. It will be performed by
the Stanford Chorale under the

direction of Prof. Harold Schmidt.
The program will also include
Bach's "Brandenburg Concerto
No. 5," which will be performed
by the Stanford Chamber
Orchestra under the direction of
Prof. Sandor Salgo. Soloists will
be Francea Lundstrom, flute,
Kenneth Goldsmith, violin, and
Margaret Fabrizio, harpsichord.
An ensemble of singers from
the Stanford Chorale and the
Memorial Church Choir, directed
by Prof. Schmidt, will perform
Bach's "Cantata No. 34 (O ewiges
Feuer)."
The program for Saturday's
concert will include representative
works which have been studies in
Prof. Aldrich's notation classes.
Medieval and Renaissance vocal
and instrumental music will be
performed by members of the
early music performance practice
program under the direction of
Lyle Nordstrom. Soprano Marie
Gibson will sing Scarlatti's
cantata, "Tu che una Dea," and
Mrs. Fabrizio will also perform.
Prof. Aldrich came to Stanford
in 1950 and shortly thereafter
initiated the studies in
performance practices of early
music for which the Music
Department is noted.
Greek Composer
The Music Department also
will present a free concert of
music by visiting Greek composer
Theodore Antoniou at 8:30 p.m.
Tuesday, June 3, in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium.
Composer Antoniou has been
spending winter and spring

quarters at Stanford teaching
composition and orchestration.
The program will include one
of his earliest works, "Trio for
Flute, Viola and Cello," in which
he combines folk dance elements
with free usage of the 12-tone
system.
Also on the program will be
"Dialogues for Flute and Guitar,"
"Quartetto Giocoso," "Syllables,"
and "Lyrics for Violin and
Piano." Antoniou will conduct a
string ensemble in performance of
"Jeux," with cellist Bonnie
Hampton as featured soloist.
ALEA II
ALEA 11, Stnaford University's
contemporary music performing
group, will conclude its current
season with a concert of
multi-media works on Sunday,
June 1, at 8:30 p.m., in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Founder and director of ALEA
II is Theodore Antoniou, noted
avant-garde composer now in
residence at Stanford.
Antonious will conduct Hani
Christou's Anaparastasis, a theater
peice in which all participants are
required to speak, act, and move
according to directions in the
score.
For the first time in the ALEA
II series, Antoniou will conduct
one of his own works: Katharsis
(1968). Intended as a "total
concert," Katharsis is scored for
solo flute, chamber ensemble,
electric organ, tape, and light
projections. The flutist will be
Joanna Shepherd.

Also on the program will be
two other recent works. In
Richard Felciano's Crasis, to be
conducted by Jay Klein, a
chamber ensemble interacts with
electronically generated tape
sounds.
Felciano is a resident composer
at Mills College. David Sloss will
conduct Christian Wolff's Septet,
in which a new and unusual
notation specifies the order of
events but leaves free the choice
of instruments and pitches.
The "past" will be represented
by works of Varese and
Skalkottas, both to be conducted
by Antoniou: Skalkottas' Octet
(1931) for strings and winds, a
witty and engaging 12-tone piece.
