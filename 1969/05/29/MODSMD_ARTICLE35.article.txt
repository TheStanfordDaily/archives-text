# Urban Studies Courses Offered
## 
### 
The recently formed ASSU
Committee on Urban and
Environmental Curriculum has
announced three proposed courses
for next year. They are tentatively
planned to be Undergraduate
Specials utilizing an
interdisciplinary approach.
Proposed for Fall Quarter,
1969, is an Undergraduate Special
in "Urban Community Behavior."
t The seminar would include studies
in economics, sociology, and
political science, with faculty
members from each of these
fields.
The seminar planned for
Winter Quarter is "Urban Design
and the Ecosystem." Utilizing a
case-study approach, the course
would consider those areas of
architecture, biology, and the
social sciences that are relevant
For Spring Q.uarter the
committee suggested a seminar on
"The Urban Dweller: Personality
and Participation."
The ASSU Committee was

created a month ago to consider
the structuring and content of
courses dealing with urban and
environmental problems. At
present, Stanford has no formal
program of metropolitan studies.
Roy Childs, the committee's
chairman and a graduate student
in sociology, is hopeful that these
planned courses will eventually be
expanded into a broader program
leading to a major in this general
field.
Other proposals under
investigation by the committee
include the creation of an urban
campus on the order of the
Stanford overseas campuses, hut
located in a large Americn city
and with close ties with city
personnel and community
workers.
Any student interested in
participating on the committee
especially this summer in the
planning of courses and
curriculum, is urged to contact
Roy Childs at 328-6215.
