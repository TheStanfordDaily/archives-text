# Faculty Sends Open Letter To Congress Against ABM
## 
### 
Over 150 Stanford University
professors and administrators,
including four deans and nine
department chairman, have signed
an open letter to Congress urging a
"no" vote on the Administration's
proposed Safeguard Anti-Ballistic
Missile (ABM) system and a
re-ordering of national priorities.
The faculty signators included
two Nobel laureates, Arthur
Kornberg and Joshua Lederberg,
who head the Departments of
Biochemistry and Genetics,
respectively; the chairman of the
Academic Senate, Leonard Schiff;
and the chairmen of the
Geophysics, Mechanical
Engineering, Mathematics,
Radiology, Anthropology,
Pathology and Geology
Departments.
The deans included B. David
Napier, chapel; Halsey Royden,
humanities and sciences; Bayless
Manning, law; and Lincoln Moses,
graduate division.
One third of the signators were
from the University's scientific
community.
Advertising Plans
The petition and signatures will
be mailed to every Senator and
Congressman by the Stanford
Community Against the ABM. The
ad hoc committee also plans to
purchase ad space in the homestate
newspapers of senators undecided
on the ABM issue.
The 150 faculty members whose
contributsions will fund the ad

space responded within five days to
a letter-writing campaign. About
$1000 has been contributed. The
list is expected to grow before
publication in out-of-state
newspapers, according to Chick
| White, student coordinator of the
faculty drive.
The edicators signed an open
letter to Congress which reads:
"We believe that our nation's
emphasis on military expenditures
has absorbed tax dollars and human
energies which might have been
more profitably devoted to the
solution of the pressing problems of
urban despair, hunger,
over-population and environmental
deterioration. This emphasis
reflects a distorted sense of
priorities for national action.
'Distorted Priorities'
"The proposed $7 billion ABM
system is the latest and most
obvious example of these distorted
priorities. We urge you to vote'no'
on the development and
deployment of the proposed ABM
Safeguard system."
The faculty petition is part of a
massive letter-writing and student
petition drive. Almost 2000 student
signatures were gathered in three
weeks and will be forwarded to
Sen. J. William Fulbright
(Dem.-Ark) and Congressman
Allard Lowenstein (Dem.-N.Y.).
The SCAABM also solicited
some 300 direct letters to Congress
according to Chairman Bob Stern, a
third-year law student.
