# The
						Pitzers Look Back At First Six Months
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN SUSAN SWARD 
"It was perfectly clear from the beginning that
Stanford was far more complex than Rice."
The words barely capture the feelings of
Kenneth Pitzer as he concludes his first six months
as Stanford's sixth president.
Pitzer quietly spoke about those hectic months
two days ago in his newly refurbished office on
Quad. Even as he commented on the recent past,
Pitzer was clearly distracted by thoughts of the
near future and the latest crisis—the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
He did not mention the subpoena—the news
wasnotyetpublic—buthis comments ranged very
close to the present issues when he said, "The
most pressing need of Stanford is for the entire
community to really gain the will, capacity, and
mechanisms to run its internal affairs under the
pressures of the day in a fair and effective
manner."
He continued, "I believe such a goal is
achievable, perhaps not in perfection, but it is
attainable."
Drop SRI Issue
On specific matters of the day, Pitzer feels that
"The SRI issue should be dropped." He says the
Trustee decision to sever SRI from Stanford, "was
debatable but reasonable and was made by the
body legitimately empowered to make that
decision."
Pitzer hopes that income earned from sale of
SRI, if it is indeed sold, should go into what he
calls, "applied social sciences." He is worried,
however, that if financial troubles continue to
plague the University, extra income might have to
go immediately into balancing the budget rather
than new programs.
He notes, "Financial problems hit hardest in
cutting back the opportunity to do new things,
including many of the things activist students

During the five months that the Pitzers have
been at Stanford, so much has happened that Mrs.
Jean Pitzer feels as if they have been here for more
than a year.
The Pitzers did not come to Stanford totally
unprepared for the university way of life,
according to Mrs. Pitzer. They had the experience
of living in a large university when her husband
was on the faculty at Berkeley. And they had the
experience of living at a small university when Dr.
Pitzer was the President at Rice.
Campus Radicals
The President's wife says that the disruptions
on campus this winter and spring have not
surprised her extensively. Almost anybody on a
university campus who has been following the
student radical movement would not find such
developments a major surprise, Mrs. Pitzer
contends.
Although she was not startled by the existence
of a radical movement on Stanford's campus, Mrs.
Pitzer did not realize its strength in numbers
before she came to the campus. She observes that
these various crises coming One after another seem
frustrating in that a person has to devote so much
time to coping with them.
It is not that the concerns raised by the radical
students are not extremely valid. Mrs. Pitzer feels
that some of the questions raised by this
constituency represent some of the most
important issues of the times.
"But I just wish that some of these questions
could be rt olved in a less strident atmosphere,"
she said.
The emphasis that Mrs. Pitzer places on "a less
strident atmosphere" is related to her concept of
what a university atmosphere should be. The
university, from Mrs. Pitzer's vantage point, should
be a place where new ideas can be developed. It
