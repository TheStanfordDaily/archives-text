# The 						Pitzers Look Back At First Six Months
## 
### PHILIP TAUBMAN SUSAN SWARD 
"It was perfectly clear from the beginning that
Stanford was far more complex than Rice."
The words barely capture the feelings of
Kenneth Pitzer as he concludes his first six months
as Stanford's sixth president.
Pitzer quietly spoke about those hectic months
two days ago in his newly refurbished office on
Quad. Even as he commented on the recent past,
Pitzer was clearly distracted by thoughts of the
near future and the latest crisis—the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
He did not mention the subpoena—the news
wasnotyetpublic—buthis comments ranged very
close to the present issues when he said, "The
most pressing need of Stanford is for the entire
community to really gain the will, capacity, and
mechanisms to run its internal affairs under the
pressures of the day in a fair and effective
manner."
He continued, "I believe such a goal is
achievable, perhaps not in perfection, but it is
attainable."
Drop SRI Issue
On specific matters of the day, Pitzer feels that
"The SRI issue should be dropped." He says the
Trustee decision to sever SRI from Stanford, "was
debatable but reasonable and was made by the
body legitimately empowered to make that
decision."
Pitzer hopes that income earned from sale of
SRI, if it is indeed sold, should go into what he
calls, "applied social sciences." He is worried,
however, that if financial troubles continue to
plague the University, extra income might have to
go immediately into balancing the budget rather
than new programs.
He notes, "Financial problems hit hardest in
cutting back the opportunity to do new things,
including many of the things activist students

During the five months that the Pitzers have
been at Stanford, so much has happened that Mrs.
Jean Pitzer feels as if they have been here for more
than a year.
The Pitzers did not come to Stanford totally
unprepared for the university way of life,
according to Mrs. Pitzer. They had the experience
of living in a large university when her husband
was on the faculty at Berkeley. And they had the
experience of living at a small university when Dr.
Pitzer was the President at Rice.
Campus Radicals
The President's wife says that the disruptions
on campus this winter and spring have not
surprised her extensively. Almost anybody on a
university campus who has been following the
student radical movement would not find such
developments a major surprise, Mrs. Pitzer
contends.
Although she was not startled by the existence
of a radical movement on Stanford's campus, Mrs.
Pitzer did not realize its strength in numbers
before she came to the campus. She observes that
these various crises coming One after another seem
frustrating in that a person has to devote so much
time to coping with them.
It is not that the concerns raised by the radical
students are not extremely valid. Mrs. Pitzer feels
that some of the questions raised by this
constituency represent some of the most
important issues of the times.
"But I just wish that some of these questions
could be rt olved in a less strident atmosphere,"
she said.
The emphasis that Mrs. Pitzer places on "a less
strident atmosphere" is related to her concept of
what a university atmosphere should be. The
university, from Mrs. Pitzer's vantage point, should
be a place where new ideas can be developed. It

would like to do. I'm thinking, for
example, of programs for policy
analysis, and study of urban
problems."
Thinking Back
Thinking back to the sweep of
time since he took office on
December 1, 1968, Pitzer says,
"When I first came to Stanford I
didn't have a precise concept of
the job. Some of the difficulties I
have faced, however, were not
unexpected. Because of Stanford's
size, I have not had as much
contact with faculty and students
as I had at Rice."
Has Pitzer changed during the
year? Somewhat. He says,"I have
been influenced by circumstances
to some degree, but I have not
adopted any greatly different
viewpoint."
Many people on campus point
to Pitzer's April Trustees' meeting
speech as a dramatic shift in his
public attitudes on national issues.
In now familiar words, Pitzer
stated to the Board, "You are
being asked through your deicsion
on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we
spend too much on the military,
on the means to kill people, and
not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people
to live."
In that speech he commented
about Vietnam: "It is clearly a
violation of human rights to draft

a young man to fight a war which
he regards as grossly immoral and
about which the nation is
unsure."
To many, his words marked a
change from a man thought to be
inextricably wedded to the
governmental community through
past association with the Atomic
Energy Commission and more
recent work for the Rand
Corporation and for the
President's Science Advisory
Committee.
Speech to Trustees
Thinking back today, Pitzer
says, "My speech to the Trustees
convinced people that I meant
what I had been saying all along
about my beliefs on our priorities.
I simply said it in April under
different circumstances and with
different words."
Since the time of his speech,
Pitzer has spent uncountable
hours dealing with crisis on
campus. He says he has, "learned
to live with a certain amount of
pressure without upsetting my life
too much. I have spent a not
inconsequential amount of time
on disruptions, plus the time I
must spend with alumni
ameliorating and mending after a
disruption. That time could be
better spent."
Looking at the entire scope of
his job, Pitzer comments, "It is
awfully easy to get discouraged.
President Heffner at Brown just
tossed in the sponge. Some of us
just get mad and dig in harder."
Pitzer believes that in times of
"special stress," activities that
aren't essential, "must be
cancelled." As he looks toward
the summer he seems ready to use
the word "essential" very
sparingly.
He hopes it won't be because
of "special stress."

should be an exciting, innovative
place.
The university will take on
these qualities when people work
through constructive channels,
Mrs. Pitzer states. She further
observes that by "constructive
channels" she does not mean her
way of doing things.
Confrontation tactics do not
come under Mrs. Pitzer's
definition of "constructive
channels." She finds such tactics
rather sterile and non-productive.
On the other hand, if an
individual works through
constructive channels, an
atmosphere can be developed
where a tremendous
esprit-de-corps exists among all
constituencies involved.
Since she has come to
Stanford, Mrs. Pitzer's concept of
the role of the President's wife in
the university community has not
changed extensively. For the basic
concept does not change other
than in detail, Mrs. Pitzer
maintains. The "detail" that
changes includes the size of the
campus and the basic traditions of
the institution.
Essentially, Mrs. Pitzer
envisions the role of the
President's wife as a very personal
relationship. "It's a one to one
concept," she states. She does not

believe in commenting on areas of
the university that she deems to
come under her husband's
governance.
What has Mrs. Pitzer enjoyed
the most since she came to
Stanford?
The support that the faculty
has given her husband has meant a
great deal to Mrs. Pitzer. She also
appreciates the welcome that the
university community extended
to her and her husband upon their
arrival to Stanford.
Looking back at her time at
Rice, there are of course some
friends and other aspects of the
Rice community that Mrs. Pitzer
misses. One remarkable thing
about Houston, where Rice
University is situated, is the
amount of courtesy that
individuals show one another.
Even though the Stanford
community is not as close to the
core of a city as Rice was to
Houston, Mrs. Pitzer does not feel
"any more isolated than the next
person" living on the Peninsula.
There are even some notes of
irony to be observed when the
Pitzers talk about their move from
Rice to Stanford. The southern
magnolia tree on the Pitzers'
grounds at Stanford, for example,
is a much more healthy tree than
any of the southern magnolia
trees that they had back at Rice.

Looking at the entire scope of
his job, Pitzer comments, "It is
awfully easy to get discouraged.
President Heffner at Brown just
tossed in the sponge. Some of us
just get mad and dig in harder."
Pitzer believes that in times of
"special stress," activities that
aren't essential, "must be

the summer he seems ready to use
the word "essential" very
sparingly.
He hopes it won't be because

The university will take on
these qualities when people work
through constructive channels,
Mrs. Pitzer states. She further
observes that by "constructive
channels" she does not mean her
way of doing things.
Confrontation tactics do not
come under Mrs. Pitzer's
definition of "constructive

rather sterile and non-productive.
On the other hand, if an
individual works through
constructive channels, an
atmosphere can be developed
where a tremendous
esprit-de-corps exists among all
constituencies involved.
Since she has come to
Stanford, Mrs. Pitzer's concept of
the role of the President's wife in
the university community has not
changed extensively. For the basic
concept does not change other
than in detail, Mrs. Pitzer
maintains. The "detail" that
changes includes the size of the
campus and the basic traditions of
the institution.
Essentially, Mrs. Pitzer
envisions the role of the
President's wife as a very personal
relationship. "It's a one to one
concept," she states. She does not

believe in commenting on areas of
the university that she deems to
come under her husband's
governance.
What has Mrs. Pitzer enjoyed
the most since she came to
Stanford?
The support that the faculty
has given her husband has meant a
great deal to Mrs. Pitzer. She also
appreciates the welcome that the
university community extended
to her and her husband upon their
arrival to Stanford.
Looking back at her time at
Rice, there are of course some
friends and other aspects of the
Rice community that Mrs. Pitzer
misses. One remarkable thing
about Houston, where Rice
University is situated, is the
amount of courtesy that
individuals show one another.
Even though the Stanford
community is not as close to the
core of a city as Rice was to
Houston, Mrs. Pitzer does not feel
"any more isolated than the next
person" living on the Peninsula.
There are even some notes of
irony to be observed when the
Pitzers talk about their move from
Rice to Stanford. The southern
magnolia tree on the Pitzers'
grounds at Stanford, for example,
is a much more healthy tree than
any of the southern magnolia
trees that they had back at Rice.
"It was perfectly clear from the beginning that
Stanford was far more complex than Rice."
The words barely capture the feelings of
Kenneth Pitzer as he concludes his first six months
as Stanford's sixth president.
Pitzer quietly spoke about those hectic months
two days ago in his newly refurbished office on
Quad. Even as he commented on the recent past,
Pitzer was clearly distracted by thoughts of the
near future and the latest crisis—the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
He did not mention the subpoena—the news
wasnotyetpublic—buthis comments ranged very
close to the present issues when he said, "The
most pressing need of Stanford is for the entire
community to really gain the will, capacity, and
mechanisms to run its internal affairs under the
pressures of the day in a fair and effective
manner."
He continued, "I believe such a goal is
achievable, perhaps not in perfection, but it is
attainable."
Drop SRI Issue
On specific matters of the day, Pitzer feels that
"The SRI issue should be dropped." He says the
Trustee decision to sever SRI from Stanford, "was
debatable but reasonable and was made by the
body legitimately empowered to make that
decision."
Pitzer hopes that income earned from sale of
SRI, if it is indeed sold, should go into what he
calls, "applied social sciences." He is worried,
however, that if financial troubles continue to
plague the University, extra income might have to
go immediately into balancing the budget rather
than new programs.
He notes, "Financial problems hit hardest in
cutting back the opportunity to do new things,
including many of the things activist students

During the five months that the Pitzers have
been at Stanford, so much has happened that Mrs.
Jean Pitzer feels as if they have been here for more
than a year.
The Pitzers did not come to Stanford totally
unprepared for the university way of life,
according to Mrs. Pitzer. They had the experience
of living in a large university when her husband
was on the faculty at Berkeley. And they had the
experience of living at a small university when Dr.
Pitzer was the President at Rice.
Campus Radicals
The President's wife says that the disruptions
on campus this winter and spring have not
surprised her extensively. Almost anybody on a
university campus who has been following the
student radical movement would not find such
developments a major surprise, Mrs. Pitzer
contends.
Although she was not startled by the existence
of a radical movement on Stanford's campus, Mrs.
Pitzer did not realize its strength in numbers
before she came to the campus. She observes that
these various crises coming One after another seem
frustrating in that a person has to devote so much
time to coping with them.
It is not that the concerns raised by the radical
students are not extremely valid. Mrs. Pitzer feels
that some of the questions raised by this
constituency represent some of the most
important issues of the times.
"But I just wish that some of these questions
could be rt olved in a less strident atmosphere,"
she said.
The emphasis that Mrs. Pitzer places on "a less
strident atmosphere" is related to her concept of
what a university atmosphere should be. The
university, from Mrs. Pitzer's vantage point, should
be a place where new ideas can be developed. It

example, of programs for policy
analysis, and study of urban
problems."
Thinking Back
Thinking back to the sweep of
time since he took office on
December 1, 1968, Pitzer says,
"When I first came to Stanford I
didn't have a precise concept of
the job. Some of the difficulties I
have faced, however, were not
unexpected. Because of Stanford's
size, I have not had as much
contact with faculty and students
as I had at Rice."
Has Pitzer changed during the
year? Somewhat. He says,"I have
been influenced by circumstances
to some degree, but I have not
adopted any greatly different
viewpoint."
Many people on campus point
to Pitzer's April Trustees' meeting
speech as a dramatic shift in his
public attitudes on national issues.
In now familiar words, Pitzer
stated to the Board, "You are
being asked through your deicsion
on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we
spend too much on the military,
on the means to kill people, and
not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people
to live."
In that speech he commented
about Vietnam: "It is clearly a
violation of human rights to draft

a young man to fight a war which
he regards as grossly immoral and
about which the nation is
unsure."
To many, his words marked a
change from a man thought to be
inextricably wedded to the
governmental community through
past association with the Atomic
Energy Commission and more
recent work for the Rand
Corporation and for the
President's Science Advisory
Committee.
Speech to Trustees
Thinking back today, Pitzer
says, "My speech to the Trustees
convinced people that I meant
what I had been saying all along
about my beliefs on our priorities.
I simply said it in April under
different circumstances and with
different words."
Since the time of his speech,
Pitzer has spent uncountable
hours dealing with crisis on
campus. He says he has, "learned
to live with a certain amount of
pressure without upsetting my life
too much. I have spent a not
inconsequential amount of time
on disruptions, plus the time I
must spend with alumni
ameliorating and mending after a
disruption. That time could be
better spent."
Looking at the entire scope of
his job, Pitzer comments, "It is
awfully easy to get discouraged.
President Heffner at Brown just
tossed in the sponge. Some of us
just get mad and dig in harder."
Pitzer believes that in times of

example, of programs for policy

problems."
Thinking Back
Thinking back to the sweep of
time since he took office on
December 1, 1968, Pitzer says,
"When I first came to Stanford I
didn't have a precise concept of
the job. Some of the difficulties I
have faced, however, were not
unexpected. Because of Stanford's
size, I have not had as much
contact with faculty and students
as I had at Rice."
Has Pitzer changed during the
year? Somewhat. He says,"I have
been influenced by circumstances
to some degree, but I have not
adopted any greatly different
viewpoint."
Many people on campus point
to Pitzer's April Trustees' meeting
speech as a dramatic shift in his
public attitudes on national issues.
In now familiar words, Pitzer
stated to the Board, "You are
being asked through your deicsion
on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we
spend too much on the military,
on the means to kill people, and
not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people
to live."
In that speech he commented
about Vietnam: "It is clearly a
violation of human rights to draft

a young man to fight a war which
he regards as grossly immoral and
about which the nation is
unsure."
To many, his words marked a
change from a man thought to be
inextricably wedded to the
governmental community through
past association with the Atomic
Energy Commission and more
recent work for the Rand
Corporation and for the
President's Science Advisory
Committee.
Speech to Trustees
Thinking back today, Pitzer
says, "My speech to the Trustees
convinced people that I meant
what I had been saying all along
about my beliefs on our priorities.
I simply said it in April under
different circumstances and with
different words."
Since the time of his speech,
Pitzer has spent uncountable
hours dealing with crisis on
campus. He says he has, "learned
to live with a certain amount of
pressure without upsetting my life
too much. I have spent a not
inconsequential amount of time
on disruptions, plus the time I
must spend with alumni
ameliorating and mending after a
disruption. That time could be
better spent."
Looking at the entire scope of
his job, Pitzer comments, "It is
awfully easy to get discouraged.
President Heffner at Brown just
tossed in the sponge. Some of us
just get mad and dig in harder."
Pitzer believes that in times of
"special stress," activities that
aren't essential, "must be
cancelled." As he looks toward
the summer he seems ready to use
the word "essential" very
sparingly.
He hopes it won't be because
of "special stress."

should be an exciting, innovative
place.
The university will take on
these qualities when people work
through constructive channels,
Mrs. Pitzer states. She further
observes that by "constructive
channels" she does not mean her
way of doing things.
Confrontation tactics do not
come under Mrs. Pitzer's
definition of "constructive
channels." She finds such tactics
rather sterile and non-productive.
On the other hand, if an
individual works through
constructive channels, an
atmosphere can be developed
where a tremendous
esprit-de-corps exists among all
constituencies involved.
Since she has come to
Stanford, Mrs. Pitzer's concept of
the role of the President's wife in
the university community has not
changed extensively. For the basic
concept does not change other
than in detail, Mrs. Pitzer
maintains. The "detail" that
changes includes the size of the
campus and the basic traditions of
the institution.
Essentially, Mrs. Pitzer
envisions the role of the
President's wife as a very personal
relationship. "It's a one to one
concept," she states. She does not

believe in commenting on areas of
the university that she deems to
come under her husband's
governance.
What has Mrs. Pitzer enjoyed
the most since she came to
Stanford?
The support that the faculty
has given her husband has meant a
great deal to Mrs. Pitzer. She also
appreciates the welcome that the
university community extended
to her and her husband upon their
arrival to Stanford.
Looking back at her time at
Rice, there are of course some
friends and other aspects of the
Rice community that Mrs. Pitzer
misses. One remarkable thing
about Houston, where Rice
University is situated, is the
amount of courtesy that
individuals show one another.
Even though the Stanford
community is not as close to the
core of a city as Rice was to
Houston, Mrs. Pitzer does not feel
"any more isolated than the next
person" living on the Peninsula.
There are even some notes of
irony to be observed when the
Pitzers talk about their move from
Rice to Stanford. The southern
magnolia tree on the Pitzers'
grounds at Stanford, for example,
is a much more healthy tree than
any of the southern magnolia
trees that they had back at Rice.
"It was perfectly clear from the beginning that
Stanford was far more complex than Rice."
The words barely capture the feelings of
Kenneth Pitzer as he concludes his first six months
as Stanford's sixth president.
Pitzer quietly spoke about those hectic months
two days ago in his newly refurbished office on
Quad. Even as he commented on the recent past,
Pitzer was clearly distracted by thoughts of the
near future and the latest crisis—the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
He did not mention the subpoena—the news
wasnotyetpublic—buthis comments ranged very
close to the present issues when he said, "The
most pressing need of Stanford is for the entire
community to really gain the will, capacity, and
mechanisms to run its internal affairs under the
pressures of the day in a fair and effective
manner."
He continued, "I believe such a goal is
achievable, perhaps not in perfection, but it is
attainable."
Drop SRI Issue
On specific matters of the day, Pitzer feels that
"The SRI issue should be dropped." He says the
Trustee decision to sever SRI from Stanford, "was
debatable but reasonable and was made by the
body legitimately empowered to make that
decision."
Pitzer hopes that income earned from sale of
SRI, if it is indeed sold, should go into what he
calls, "applied social sciences." He is worried,
however, that if financial troubles continue to
plague the University, extra income might have to
go immediately into balancing the budget rather
than new programs.
He notes, "Financial problems hit hardest in
cutting back the opportunity to do new things,
including many of the things activist students

During the five months that the Pitzers have
been at Stanford, so much has happened that Mrs.
Jean Pitzer feels as if they have been here for more
than a year.
The Pitzers did not come to Stanford totally
unprepared for the university way of life,
according to Mrs. Pitzer. They had the experience
of living in a large university when her husband
was on the faculty at Berkeley. And they had the
experience of living at a small university when Dr.
Pitzer was the President at Rice.
Campus Radicals
The President's wife says that the disruptions
on campus this winter and spring have not
surprised her extensively. Almost anybody on a
university campus who has been following the
student radical movement would not find such
developments a major surprise, Mrs. Pitzer
contends.
Although she was not startled by the existence
of a radical movement on Stanford's campus, Mrs.
Pitzer did not realize its strength in numbers
before she came to the campus. She observes that
these various crises coming One after another seem
frustrating in that a person has to devote so much
time to coping with them.
It is not that the concerns raised by the radical
students are not extremely valid. Mrs. Pitzer feels
that some of the questions raised by this
constituency represent some of the most
important issues of the times.
"But I just wish that some of these questions
could be rt olved in a less strident atmosphere,"
she said.
The emphasis that Mrs. Pitzer places on "a less
strident atmosphere" is related to her concept of
what a university atmosphere should be. The
university, from Mrs. Pitzer's vantage point, should
be a place where new ideas can be developed. It

Quad. Even as he commented on the recent past,
Pitzer was clearly distracted by thoughts of the
near future and the latest crisis—the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
He did not mention the subpoena—the news
wasnotyetpublic—buthis comments ranged very
close to the present issues when he said, "The
most pressing need of Stanford is for the entire
community to really gain the will, capacity, and
mechanisms to run its internal affairs under the
pressures of the day in a fair and effective
manner."
He continued, "I believe such a goal is
achievable, perhaps not in perfection, but it is
attainable."
Drop SRI Issue
On specific matters of the day, Pitzer feels that
"The SRI issue should be dropped." He says the
Trustee decision to sever SRI from Stanford, "was
debatable but reasonable and was made by the
body legitimately empowered to make that
decision."
Pitzer hopes that income earned from sale of
SRI, if it is indeed sold, should go into what he
calls, "applied social sciences." He is worried,
however, that if financial troubles continue to
plague the University, extra income might have to
go immediately into balancing the budget rather
than new programs.
He notes, "Financial problems hit hardest in
cutting back the opportunity to do new things,
including many of the things activist students

During the five months that the Pitzers have
been at Stanford, so much has happened that Mrs.
Jean Pitzer feels as if they have been here for more
than a year.
The Pitzers did not come to Stanford totally
unprepared for the university way of life,
according to Mrs. Pitzer. They had the experience
of living in a large university when her husband
was on the faculty at Berkeley. And they had the
experience of living at a small university when Dr.
Pitzer was the President at Rice.
Campus Radicals
The President's wife says that the disruptions
on campus this winter and spring have not
surprised her extensively. Almost anybody on a
university campus who has been following the
student radical movement would not find such
developments a major surprise, Mrs. Pitzer
contends.
Although she was not startled by the existence
of a radical movement on Stanford's campus, Mrs.
Pitzer did not realize its strength in numbers
before she came to the campus. She observes that
these various crises coming One after another seem
frustrating in that a person has to devote so much
time to coping with them.
It is not that the concerns raised by the radical
students are not extremely valid. Mrs. Pitzer feels
that some of the questions raised by this
constituency represent some of the most
important issues of the times.
"But I just wish that some of these questions
could be rt olved in a less strident atmosphere,"
she said.
The emphasis that Mrs. Pitzer places on "a less
strident atmosphere" is related to her concept of
what a university atmosphere should be. The
university, from Mrs. Pitzer's vantage point, should
be a place where new ideas can be developed. It

would like to do. I'm thinking, for
example, of programs for policy
analysis, and study of urban
problems."
Thinking Back
Thinking back to the sweep of
time since he took office on
December 1, 1968, Pitzer says,
"When I first came to Stanford I
didn't have a precise concept of
the job. Some of the difficulties I
have faced, however, were not
unexpected. Because of Stanford's
size, I have not had as much
contact with faculty and students
as I had at Rice."
Has Pitzer changed during the
year? Somewhat. He says,"I have
been influenced by circumstances
to some degree, but I have not
adopted any greatly different
viewpoint."
Many people on campus point
to Pitzer's April Trustees' meeting
speech as a dramatic shift in his
public attitudes on national issues.
In now familiar words, Pitzer
stated to the Board, "You are
being asked through your deicsion
on SRI to say that our national
priorities are wrong—that we
spend too much on the military,
on the means to kill people, and
not enough on constructive
things, on helping ordinary people
to live."
In that speech he commented
about Vietnam: "It is clearly a
violation of human rights to draft

a young man to fight a war which
he regards as grossly immoral and
about which the nation is
unsure."
To many, his words marked a
change from a man thought to be
inextricably wedded to the
governmental community through
past association with the Atomic
Energy Commission and more
recent work for the Rand
Corporation and for the
President's Science Advisory
Committee.
Speech to Trustees
Thinking back today, Pitzer
says, "My speech to the Trustees
convinced people that I meant
what I had been saying all along
about my beliefs on our priorities.
I simply said it in April under
different circumstances and with
different words."
Since the time of his speech,
Pitzer has spent uncountable
hours dealing with crisis on
campus. He says he has, "learned
to live with a certain amount of
pressure without upsetting my life
too much. I have spent a not
inconsequential amount of time
on disruptions, plus the time I
must spend with alumni
ameliorating and mending after a
disruption. That time could be
better spent."
Looking at the entire scope of
his job, Pitzer comments, "It is
awfully easy to get discouraged.
President Heffner at Brown just
tossed in the sponge. Some of us
just get mad and dig in harder."
Pitzer believes that in times of
"special stress," activities that
aren't essential, "must be
cancelled." As he looks toward
the summer he seems ready to use
the word "essential" very
sparingly.
He hopes it won't be because
of "special stress."

should be an exciting, innovative
place.
The university will take on
these qualities when people work
through constructive channels,
Mrs. Pitzer states. She further
observes that by "constructive
channels" she does not mean her
way of doing things.
Confrontation tactics do not
come under Mrs. Pitzer's
definition of "constructive
channels." She finds such tactics
rather sterile and non-productive.
On the other hand, if an
individual works through
constructive channels, an
atmosphere can be developed
where a tremendous
esprit-de-corps exists among all
constituencies involved.
Since she has come to
Stanford, Mrs. Pitzer's concept of
the role of the President's wife in
the university community has not
changed extensively. For the basic
concept does not change other
than in detail, Mrs. Pitzer
maintains. The "detail" that
changes includes the size of the
campus and the basic traditions of
the institution.
Essentially, Mrs. Pitzer
envisions the role of the
President's wife as a very personal
relationship. "It's a one to one
concept," she states. She does not

believe in commenting on areas of
the university that she deems to
come under her husband's
governance.
What has Mrs. Pitzer enjoyed
the most since she came to
Stanford?
The support that the faculty
has given her husband has meant a
great deal to Mrs. Pitzer. She also
appreciates the welcome that the
university community extended
to her and her husband upon their
arrival to Stanford.
Looking back at her time at
Rice, there are of course some
friends and other aspects of the
Rice community that Mrs. Pitzer
misses. One remarkable thing
about Houston, where Rice
University is situated, is the
amount of courtesy that
individuals show one another.
Even though the Stanford
community is not as close to the
core of a city as Rice was to
Houston, Mrs. Pitzer does not feel
"any more isolated than the next
person" living on the Peninsula.
There are even some notes of
irony to be observed when the
Pitzers talk about their move from
Rice to Stanford. The southern
magnolia tree on the Pitzers'
grounds at Stanford, for example,
is a much more healthy tree than
any of the southern magnolia
trees that they had back at Rice.
"It was perfectly clear from the beginning that
Stanford was far more complex than Rice."
The words barely capture the feelings of
Kenneth Pitzer as he concludes his first six months
as Stanford's sixth president.
Pitzer quietly spoke about those hectic months
two days ago in his newly refurbished office on
Quad. Even as he commented on the recent past,
Pitzer was clearly distracted by thoughts of the
near future and the latest crisis—the McClellan
Committee subpoena.
He did not mention the subpoena—the news
wasnotyetpublic—buthis comments ranged very
close to the present issues when he said, "The
most pressing need of Stanford is for the entire
community to really gain the will, capacity, and
mechanisms to run its internal affairs under the
pressures of the day in a fair and effective
manner."
He continued, "I believe such a goal is
achievable, perhaps not in perfection, but it is
attainable."
