# Daily Is Done; Staff Done In
## 
### 
Good morning and good-bye.
This is the last scheduled Daily j
of the quarter and of the year.
Having already published two
special issues this volume, the staff
will not publish a Dead Week issue.
Perhaps it would be more accurate
to say that the weak, dead staff will
not publish another issue.
Contrary to popular belief, we i
are students too.
The summer Stanford Daily will
begin publication on June 24. It
will appear twice a week, on
Tuesday and Friday.
The regular Daily will resume
publication on September 26,
1969.
It's been quite a spring.
Peace!
