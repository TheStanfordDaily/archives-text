Thin Blue Line?
The controversy surrounding
our police today seems to revolve
around two main points. First are
the police really the thin blue line
separating this country from
anarchy? Second are political
decisions being left to the police
either by default or design?
The idea that anarchy would
engulf America if it weren't for

the police is a popular notion in
the minds of many people today,
and it is encouraged by politicians
who are looking for a quick way
to pick up votes from people who
do not understand the issues
involved.
An association of U.S. police
chiefs recently fed this argument
when they characterized
themselves as the only thing
between America and civil war.
This dramatization of the facts is
understandable in view of the
plight of police departments
today.
Below Strength
A typical department is below
authorized strength, in need of
new equipment and at the bottom
of the list when appropriations are
considered.
Most metropolitan forces and
even in smaller cities are unable to
fill existing vacancies and are
forced into elaborate, expensive
recruiting drives that are often
coupled with a lowering of
standards.
A career policeman in a large
Illinois city explained that he can
no longer recommend a career in
the police force to young men
because of what he termed "the
widespread hostility toward the
police, who are just trying to
uphold the law."

It is easy to see why qualified
persons won't even consider a
police career today. Low pay,
little respect, slow advancement
and an outmoded system where
everyone starts at the bottom
regardless of their background or
ability are just some of the
obstacles that discourage the
potential police officer.
Many policemen condemn the
courts for making their job harder
and more dangerous by giving
light sentences and paroling
criminals that they believe should
be in prison.
A local police captain blammed
this feeling and current public
support of strong "law and order"
stands for the actions of some
officers who believe that it is their
"right" and "duty" to "punish"
offenders when possible.
Public Confidence
The police probably won't stop
believing that they are the thin
blue line until full police
confidence is restored. That
confidence is not likely to come,
however, until the police realize
that despite their opinions of
court performance, they are not
empowered to insult or punish
violators.

Many policemen condemn the
courts for making their job harder
and more dangerous by giving
light sentences and paroling
criminals that they believe should
be in prison.
A local police captain blammed
this feeling and current public
support of strong "law and order"
stands for the actions of some
officers who believe that it is their
"right" and "duty" to "punish"
offenders when possible.
Public Confidence
The police probably won't stop
believing that they are the thin
blue line until full police
confidence is restored. That
confidence is not likely to come,
however, until the police realize
that despite their opinions of
court performance, they are not
empowered to insult or punish
violators.
The apparent fact that the
police are being turned loose by
some ooliticans is recognized by
some people as the first step
toward a true police state.
A former sergeant in the
California Highway Patrol who is
now a biologist at the University
of California at Berkeley
witnessed some of the events
there; here are exerpts from his
letter printed in yesterday's San
Francisco Chronicle.
Career Successful
"My career with the Patrol was
both successful and satisfying (my
protection of life and property by
upholding the laws of the people
and the State of California
involved no compromise with
humanitarian principles.) But now
I am ashamed to have worn the
uniform and badge of the CHP.
During the past week I have daily
observed cases of beatings, of
savage police attacks and illegal

arrests by the CHP and other law
enforcement agencies. How did
this great change in police
behavior come about?"
"As a biologist I suggest that it
is a part of our nature to behave
as our leadership directs. Before
ahd during World War II German
Gestapo and military personnel,
originally little different from our
young men, became savage
murdering beasts under
Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his
police chief Heinrich Himmler.
Are Governor Reagan and Sheriff
Madigan wittingly or unwittingly
playing similar roles?
"These 'law and order boys'
are now having their field day. It
is hoped that the people of
California will benefit from
history. It may be too late."
Last summer in Chicago, what

is essentially one of the nation's
finest police forces enveloped the
streets and parks of the city in
which a latter investigation
termed "a police riot."
Policemen do not go bezerk
unless they know their superiors
will look the othe;way. Most high
officials won't look the othe;way
unless they were instructed to do
so from the top, in Chicago's case
the mayor's office.
Although some people applaud
and encourage this type of action,
it is clear that Senator Alan
Cranston of California spoke for a
far greater number when he said,
"There will be no hope for our
country if citizens who have
respected the law all their lives
lose faith in those who are
responsible for enforcing and
upholding the law."
"All right, 'A' team fall in,
column of two's," barked the Palo
Alto Police Sargeant.
Minutes later the twelve
patrolmen were running in a line
after a group of student
protestors, hoping to make some
arrests. After a short chase the
"A" team pulled up, sweating in
their flak jackets and riot helmets.
The protestors had outdistanced
them and were now regrouping
down the street.
In a slightly different scene
that this reporter witnessed in
Chicago last summer, Chicago
Police trapped almost 2,000
young people against a row of
apartment buildings and randomly
beat them along with newsmen
who were reporting the event.
Few arrests were made.
Only last week, Governor
Ronald Reagan stated that when
the dogs of war are unleashed you
have to accept the consequences.
Thin Blue Line?
The controversy surrounding
our police today seems to revolve
around two main points. First are
the police really the thin blue line
separating this country from
anarchy? Second are political
decisions being left to the police
either by default or design?
The idea that anarchy would
engulf America if it weren't for

the police is a popular notion in
the minds of many people today,
and it is encouraged by politicians
who are looking for a quick way
to pick up votes from people who
do not understand the issues
involved.
An association of U.S. police
chiefs recently fed this argument
when they characterized
themselves as the only thing
between America and civil war.
This dramatization of the facts is
understandable in view of the
plight of police departments
today.
Below Strength
A typical department is below
authorized strength, in need of
new equipment and at the bottom
of the list when appropriations are
considered.
Most metropolitan forces and
even in smaller cities are unable to
fill existing vacancies and are
forced into elaborate, expensive
recruiting drives that are often
coupled with a lowering of
standards.
A career policeman in a large
Illinois city explained that he can
no longer recommend a career in
the police force to young men
because of what he termed "the
widespread hostility toward the
police, who are just trying to
uphold the law."

It is easy to see why qualified
persons won't even consider a
police career today. Low pay,
little respect, slow advancement
and an outmoded system where
everyone starts at the bottom
regardless of their background or
ability are just some of the
obstacles that discourage the
potential police officer.
Many policemen condemn the
courts for making their job harder

of the list when appropriations are
considered.
Most metropolitan forces and
even in smaller cities are unable to
fill existing vacancies and are
forced into elaborate, expensive
recruiting drives that are often
coupled with a lowering of
standards.
A career policeman in a large
Illinois city explained that he can
no longer recommend a career in
the police force to young men
because of what he termed "the
widespread hostility toward the
police, who are just trying to
uphold the law."

It is easy to see why qualified
persons won't even consider a
police career today. Low pay,
little respect, slow advancement
and an outmoded system where
everyone starts at the bottom
regardless of their background or
ability are just some of the
obstacles that discourage the
potential police officer.
Many policemen condemn the
courts for making their job harder
and more dangerous by giving
light sentences and paroling
criminals that they believe should
be in prison.
A local police captain blammed
this feeling and current public
support of strong "law and order"
stands for the actions of some
officers who believe that it is their
"right" and "duty" to "punish"
offenders when possible.
Public Confidence
The police probably won't stop
believing that they are the thin
blue line until full police
confidence is restored. That
confidence is not likely to come,
however, until the police realize
that despite their opinions of
court performance, they are not
empowered to insult or punish
violators.
The apparent fact that the
police are being turned loose by
some ooliticans is recognized by
some people as the first step
toward a true police state.
A former sergeant in the
California Highway Patrol who is
now a biologist at the University
of California at Berkeley
witnessed some of the events
there; here are exerpts from his
letter printed in yesterday's San
Francisco Chronicle.
Career Successful
"My career with the Patrol was
both successful and satisfying (my
protection of life and property by
upholding the laws of the people
and the State of California
involved no compromise with
humanitarian principles.) But now
I am ashamed to have worn the
uniform and badge of the CHP.
During the past week I have daily
observed cases of beatings, of
savage police attacks and illegal

arrests by the CHP and other law
enforcement agencies. How did
this great change in police
behavior come about?"
"As a biologist I suggest that it
is a part of our nature to behave
as our leadership directs. Before
ahd during World War II German
Gestapo and military personnel,
originally little different from our
young men, became savage
murdering beasts under
Chancellor Adolf Hitler and his
police chief Heinrich Himmler.
Are Governor Reagan and Sheriff
Madigan wittingly or unwittingly
playing similar roles?
"These 'law and order boys'
are now having their field day. It
is hoped that the people of
California will benefit from
history. It may be too late."
Last summer in Chicago, what

is essentially one of the nation's
finest police forces enveloped the
streets and parks of the city in
which a latter investigation
termed "a police riot."
Policemen do not go bezerk
unless they know their superiors
will look the othe;way. Most high
officials won't look the othe;way
unless they were instructed to do
so from the top, in Chicago's case
the mayor's office.
Although some people applaud
and encourage this type of action,
it is clear that Senator Alan
Cranston of California spoke for a
far greater number when he said,
"There will be no hope for our
country if citizens who have
respected the law all their lives
lose faith in those who are
responsible for enforcing and
upholding the law."
"All right, 'A' team fall in,
column of two's," barked the Palo
Alto Police Sargeant.
Minutes later the twelve
patrolmen were running in a line
after a group of student
protestors, hoping to make some
arrests. After a short chase the
"A" team pulled up, sweating in
their flak jackets and riot helmets.
The protestors had outdistanced
them and were now regrouping
down the street.
In a slightly different scene
that this reporter witnessed in
Chicago last summer, Chicago
Police trapped almost 2,000
young people against a row of
apartment buildings and randomly
beat them along with newsmen
who were reporting the event.
Few arrests were made.
Only last week, Governor
Ronald Reagan stated that when
the dogs of war are unleashed you
have to accept the consequences.
Thin Blue Line?
The controversy surrounding
our police today seems to revolve
around two main points. First are
the police really the thin blue line
separating this country from
anarchy? Second are political
decisions being left to the police
either by default or design?
The idea that anarchy would
engulf America if it weren't for

the police is a popular notion in
the minds of many people today,
and it is encouraged by politicians
who are looking for a quick way
to pick up votes from people who
do not understand the issues
involved.
An association of U.S. police
chiefs recently fed this argument
when they characterized
themselves as the only thing
between America and civil war.
This dramatization of the facts is
understandable in view of the
plight of police departments
today.
Below Strength
A typical department is below
authorized strength, in need of
new equipment and at the bottom
of the list when appropriations are
considered.
Most metropolitan forces and
even in smaller cities are unable to
fill existing vacancies and are
forced into elaborate, expensive
recruiting drives that are often
coupled with a lowering of
standards.
