BERKELEY (AP)~About 150
parents of University of California
students at the Berkeley campus
called for a "return to reason"
Wednesday.
The parents said they hoped to
play a mediation role between the
university and students in the
violent dispute over construction of
a fence around university property
that young people tried to take
over for a "people's park."
Berkeley students, faculty and
city council members have asked
that the fence be taken down and
the park returned to "spontaneous
community development."
Governor Reagan has refused to
allow the fence to be taken down
and has ordered National Guard
troops to remain in Berkeley until
at least Sunday.
In one of the most peaceful
days since May 15, "people's
park" demonstrators held news
conferences and planned for a
mass march on the fenced-in lot at
noon, Friday, Memorial Day.
As police and National Guard
troops watched silently for more
than two hours, 300
demonstrators held a street dance
which featured a topless
performance by three girls.
After police took no action,
the demonstrators filtered off,

rolled onto Haste, north of a
fence enclosing a one-third block
