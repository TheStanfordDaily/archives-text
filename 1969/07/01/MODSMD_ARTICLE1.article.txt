# Stanford Officials Subpoenaed To Testify At McClellan Hearing In Washington Today
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
Stanford's top administrators
have made a sudden mass exodus
to Washington to testify today
before the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
of the U.S. Senate, headed by
Sen. John McClellan (D.-Ark.).
Included in the group are
President Kenneth S. Pitzer,
Provost Richard W. Lyman, Prof.
William Rambo, who is director of
the Stanford Electronics
Laboratory and a member of
President Pitzer's Consultative
Group on Disruptions, and Law
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman
of the Stanford Judicial Council.
Subpoenas have not yet been
served. University officials were
informed last week by staff
members of the Committee that
the McClellan group would want
them to appear today, and
subpoenas were mailed. But they
had not arrived by the time the
administrators left for
Washington.
Charles Anderson, president of
the Stanford Research Institute, is
also in the nation's capital, and is
scheduled to testify.
Subpoenas Expected
The group expects to receive
subpoenas this morning, before
the hearing.
Others from Stanford who plan
to attend the hearing are Patrick
Shea, member of the Associated
Students' Council of Presidents,
who is a summer intern with Sen.
Frank E. Moss (D.-Utah); Prof.
William Clebsch, chairman-elect of
the Senate of the Academic
Council; Lyle Nelson, director of

University Relations; Daryl
Pearson, general secretary of the
University; and Robert W. Beyers,
director of the Stanford News
Service.
This group will be present as
observers.
"So far as we know," Nelson
said, "no other university has
been subpoenaed. We are the
first."
According to Nelson,
University officials expect the
Committee to focus on two lines
of questioning: first, "Why are
you paying federal funds,
contrary to federal law, to
students who are convicted of
disruption?" Nelson said, and
second, "Why is the government
being denied the rich fruits of
university research" because of
the opposition to some of this
work by campus activists?
Second Time Around
This is the second time in little
more than a month that the
McClellan Committee has caused
confusion and consternation at
Stanford. On May 27, the
University received a subpoena
asking for all school records on 12
organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in recent
campus disturbances.
The University complied
minimally with the
subpoena—providing no names of
officers or organizations since
such information has not
officially been kept for several
years.
Also supplied were the names
of students convicted of violating
campus disruption policy who
receive federal funds, as well as
similar information for the 90
names supplied by the
Committee.
McClellan sent a letter to Pitzer
June 7 claiming that the
University was "not responsive"
in supplying only what
information it did provide, but
after another exchange,
administrators believed that the
Committee was satisfied.
Investigator Was Here
John J. Walsh, an investigator
for the group, visited the area
recently and compiled a
chronology of events since
January 1969.
Contacted last night, Pitzer
noted he would deliver a prepared
statement at the hearing, and that
the Stanford delegation would
cooperate with the Committee.
He added that the University had
been in touch with other schools,

but no inter-university plans had
been formulated.
In a statement to The Daily
last night, Shea said, "After
having sat through four or five
McClellan Committee hearings, I
have been greatly discouraged at
the seemingly perverted picture
that many of the 'professional'
investigators have been conveying
to the general public.
Will 'Counter Propaganda'
"I am hopeful, in speaking
with President Pitzer and Provost
Lyman, that they will counter
much of the derogatory
propaganda now massaging the
public."
Lyman, also contacted last
night, had no notion of why
Stanford had been selected to
appear before the Committee
ahead of any other
institution—assuming other
institutions will be called upon.
He noted that the group is
"concerned about the impact on
federally sponsored research of
the kind of campaign (against
war-related research) we've had at
Stanford this year."
The provost also said he had
"no reason to expect" that the
senators would further pursue the
information sought by the original
subpoena.
Nelson said that they "don't,
really know for sure what the
investigation is leading up to,"
suggesting that either the
Committee wanted more publicity
for the issues, or—"which I
doubt," he noted—that they had
some specific piece of legislation
in mind.
Stanford representatives are
not expected to be called to
testify before 11:30 a.m. E.D.T.
(8:30 locally), because other
witnesses have not completed
their testimony.
Today
Today Charles Windsor will be
invested in Caernarvon with the
full privileges and prerogatives
that go with holding the title of
I*rince of Wales.
We also expect that some news
will be made today by Celtic
nationalists.

Stanford's top administrators
have made a sudden mass exodus
to Washington to testify today
before the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
of the U.S. Senate, headed by
Sen. John McClellan (D.-Ark.).
Included in the group are
President Kenneth S. Pitzer,
Provost Richard W. Lyman, Prof.
William Rambo, who is director of
the Stanford Electronics
Laboratory and a member of
President Pitzer's Consultative
Group on Disruptions, and Law
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman
of the Stanford Judicial Council.
Subpoenas have not yet been
served. University officials were
informed last week by staff
members of the Committee that
the McClellan group would want
them to appear today, and
subpoenas were mailed. But they
had not arrived by the time the
administrators left for
Washington.
Charles Anderson, president of
the Stanford Research Institute, is
also in the nation's capital, and is
scheduled to testify.
Subpoenas Expected
The group expects to receive
subpoenas this morning, before
the hearing.
Others from Stanford who plan
to attend the hearing are Patrick
Shea, member of the Associated
Students' Council of Presidents,
who is a summer intern with Sen.
Frank E. Moss (D.-Utah); Prof.
William Clebsch, chairman-elect of
the Senate of the Academic
Council; Lyle Nelson, director of

University Relations; Daryl
Pearson, general secretary of the
University; and Robert W. Beyers,
director of the Stanford News
Service.
This group will be present as
observers.
"So far as we know," Nelson
said, "no other university has
been subpoenaed. We are the
first."
According to Nelson,
University officials expect the
Committee to focus on two lines
of questioning: first, "Why are
you paying federal funds,
contrary to federal law, to
students who are convicted of
disruption?" Nelson said, and
second, "Why is the government
being denied the rich fruits of
university research" because of
the opposition to some of this
work by campus activists?
Second Time Around
This is the second time in little
more than a month that the
McClellan Committee has caused
confusion and consternation at
Stanford. On May 27, the
University received a subpoena
asking for all school records on 12
organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in recent
campus disturbances.
The University complied
minimally with the
subpoena—providing no names of
officers or organizations since
such information has not
officially been kept for several
years.
Also supplied were the names
of students convicted of violating
campus disruption policy who
receive federal funds, as well as
similar information for the 90
names supplied by the
Committee.
McClellan sent a letter to Pitzer
June 7 claiming that the
University was "not responsive"
in supplying only what
information it did provide, but
after another exchange,
administrators believed that the
Committee was satisfied.
Investigator Was Here
John J. Walsh, an investigator
for the group, visited the area
recently and compiled a
chronology of events since
January 1969.
Contacted last night, Pitzer
noted he would deliver a prepared
statement at the hearing, and that
the Stanford delegation would
cooperate with the Committee.
He added that the University had
been in touch with other schools,

but no inter-university plans had
been formulated.
In a statement to The Daily
last night, Shea said, "After
having sat through four or five
McClellan Committee hearings, I
have been greatly discouraged at
the seemingly perverted picture
that many of the 'professional'
investigators have been conveying
to the general public.
Will 'Counter Propaganda'
"I am hopeful, in speaking
with President Pitzer and Provost
Lyman, that they will counter
much of the derogatory
propaganda now massaging the
public."
Lyman, also contacted last
night, had no notion of why
Stanford had been selected to
appear before the Committee
ahead of any other
institution—assuming other
institutions will be called upon.
He noted that the group is
"concerned about the impact on
federally sponsored research of
the kind of campaign (against
war-related research) we've had at
Stanford this year."
The provost also said he had
"no reason to expect" that the
senators would further pursue the
information sought by the original
subpoena.
Nelson said that they "don't,
really know for sure what the
investigation is leading up to,"
suggesting that either the
Committee wanted more publicity
for the issues, or—"which I
doubt," he noted—that they had
some specific piece of legislation
in mind.
Stanford representatives are
not expected to be called to
testify before 11:30 a.m. E.D.T.
(8:30 locally), because other
witnesses have not completed
their testimony.
Today
Today Charles Windsor will be
invested in Caernarvon with the
full privileges and prerogatives
that go with holding the title of
I*rince of Wales.
We also expect that some news
will be made today by Celtic
nationalists.

Stanford's top administrators
have made a sudden mass exodus
to Washington to testify today
before the Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
of the U.S. Senate, headed by
Sen. John McClellan (D.-Ark.).
Included in the group are
President Kenneth S. Pitzer,
Provost Richard W. Lyman, Prof.
William Rambo, who is director of
the Stanford Electronics
Laboratory and a member of
President Pitzer's Consultative
Group on Disruptions, and Law
Prof. Jack Friedenthal, chairman
of the Stanford Judicial Council.
Subpoenas have not yet been
served. University officials were
informed last week by staff
members of the Committee that
the McClellan group would want
them to appear today, and
subpoenas were mailed. But they
had not arrived by the time the
administrators left for
Washington.
Charles Anderson, president of
the Stanford Research Institute, is
also in the nation's capital, and is
scheduled to testify.
Subpoenas Expected
The group expects to receive
subpoenas this morning, before
the hearing.
Others from Stanford who plan
to attend the hearing are Patrick
Shea, member of the Associated
Students' Council of Presidents,
who is a summer intern with Sen.
Frank E. Moss (D.-Utah); Prof.
William Clebsch, chairman-elect of
the Senate of the Academic
Council; Lyle Nelson, director of

University Relations; Daryl
Pearson, general secretary of the
University; and Robert W. Beyers,
director of the Stanford News
Service.
This group will be present as
observers.
"So far as we know," Nelson
said, "no other university has
been subpoenaed. We are the
first."
According to Nelson,
University officials expect the
Committee to focus on two lines
of questioning: first, "Why are
you paying federal funds,
contrary to federal law, to
students who are convicted of
disruption?" Nelson said, and
second, "Why is the government
being denied the rich fruits of
university research" because of
the opposition to some of this
work by campus activists?
Second Time Around
This is the second time in little
more than a month that the
McClellan Committee has caused
confusion and consternation at
Stanford. On May 27, the
University received a subpoena
asking for all school records on 12
organizations and 90 individuals
allegedly involved in recent
campus disturbances.
The University complied
minimally with the
subpoena—providing no names of
officers or organizations since
such information has not
officially been kept for several
years.
Also supplied were the names
of students convicted of violating
campus disruption policy who
receive federal funds, as well as
similar information for the 90
names supplied by the
Committee.
McClellan sent a letter to Pitzer
June 7 claiming that the
University was "not responsive"
in supplying only what
information it did provide, but
after another exchange,
administrators believed that the
Committee was satisfied.
Investigator Was Here
John J. Walsh, an investigator
for the group, visited the area
recently and compiled a
chronology of events since
January 1969.
Contacted last night, Pitzer
noted he would deliver a prepared
statement at the hearing, and that
the Stanford delegation would
cooperate with the Committee.
He added that the University had
been in touch with other schools,

but no inter-university plans had
been formulated.
In a statement to The Daily
last night, Shea said, "After
having sat through four or five
McClellan Committee hearings, I
have been greatly discouraged at
the seemingly perverted picture
that many of the 'professional'
investigators have been conveying
to the general public.
Will 'Counter Propaganda'
"I am hopeful, in speaking
with President Pitzer and Provost
Lyman, that they will counter
much of the derogatory
propaganda now massaging the
public."
Lyman, also contacted last
night, had no notion of why
Stanford had been selected to
appear before the Committee
ahead of any other
institution—assuming other
institutions will be called upon.
He noted that the group is
"concerned about the impact on
federally sponsored research of
the kind of campaign (against
war-related research) we've had at
Stanford this year."
The provost also said he had
"no reason to expect" that the
senators would further pursue the
information sought by the original
subpoena.
Nelson said that they "don't,
really know for sure what the
investigation is leading up to,"
suggesting that either the
Committee wanted more publicity
for the issues, or—"which I
doubt," he noted—that they had
some specific piece of legislation
in mind.
Stanford representatives are
not expected to be called to
testify before 11:30 a.m. E.D.T.
(8:30 locally), because other
witnesses have not completed
their testimony.
Today
Today Charles Windsor will be
invested in Caernarvon with the
full privileges and prerogatives
that go with holding the title of
I*rince of Wales.
We also expect that some news
will be made today by Celtic
nationalists.
