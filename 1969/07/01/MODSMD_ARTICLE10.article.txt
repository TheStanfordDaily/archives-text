## The 						Case Against Fluoridation 
### Ned Groth 
The Daily of May 23 carried
the news that campus
homeowners and Escondido
tenants will be blessed with
fluoridated drinking water,
starting late in the summer or
sometime in the fall. Perhaps this
is locking the barn door after,
etc., but I feel obligated to state
my strenuous objection to the
addition of fluoride to drinking
water, even for the laudable
purpose of reducing tooth decay.
My objections are based on
several months of thorough
evaluation of the scientific
literature on fluoridation and
related topics; in addition, the
manner in which fluoridation is
promoted and sold to the public
leads me to question the worth of
the procedure.
Tooth decay, its causes and
prevention, is a complicated and
highly variable process which
involves far more than the simple
presence or absence of the
fluoride ion in the drinking water.
Fluoride is certainly not necessary
to prevent cavities, although it
does have some effect in making
teeth more resistant to decay.
However, fluoride is also an
extremely toxic substance; even at
very low concentrations, the ion is
accumulated in the body, and
may, over time, do serious
damage.
Dental Benefits
Assuming one wants the dental
benefits of fluoride, but would
prefer not to risk long-term side
effects, there are several ways to
administer fluoride without
dumping it in the water supply.
Tablets can be taken on an
individual basis at home; dentists
can give private treatments; and
there is now a super-strong
fluoride toothpaste, one
application of which will last a
whole year, which is being
administered at grade-school
"brush-ins." All of these options
are readily available to Stanford
residents.
Among the many alternatives,
fluoridation of community water
supplies is least desirable for the
following (among other) reasons:
Fluoridation costs up to
twenty times what some of the
alternatives would cost.
Ninety-nine per cent of the
water supply is used for purposes
other than human consumption,
so most of the fluoride goes down
the drain.
Although children are expected
to derive the most benefit from
fluoridation, people of all ages are
subjected to the potential risk.
Individuals drink widely
different amounts of water,
making controlled or uniform
dosage of fluoride impossible.
Fluoridation forces everyone
to consume a potentially toxic
substance, whether or not he
wants to or needs to. (Or it forces
him to buy bottled water, at extra
expense.)

The possibility of long-term
toxic effects has not been
satisfactorily resolved.
Last Point Crucial
This last point is crucial.
Although there is not yet much
really solid evidence that fluoride
at one part per million causes
serious trouble, there is definite
proof that levels only slightly
higher, consumed day after day,
can be extremely damaging in the
long run.
Recent research by a Canadian
group showed that foods and
beverages prepared with
fluoridated water contained
enough fluoride to raise an
individual's daily dose into a range
considered hazardous after several
years. As more and more cities
adopt fluoridation, more foods
will be processed in fluoridated
water, and the average amount of
fluoride in our diets very likely
will increase.
Just as it has taken a long time
to document the damage done by
DDT, it will take many years of
competent research to
demonstrate the effects of chronic
low-level fluoride ingestion on
human beings. A lack of such
basis knowledge is reason to be
extremely cautious about
increasing the amount of fluoride
in he environment; yet the U.S.
Public Health Service has been
enthusiastically promoting
fluoridation, and has tended to
ignore evidence (such as the
information on fluoride content
of foods) which would argue
against fluoridation.
Balancing Potential Risks
The decision to fluoride or not
to do so involves balancing
potential risks against possible
benefits. When the public has to
make such a risk-benefit decision
at the ballot box, it is essential
that both sides be presented fairly
and objectively.
Fluoridation was touted as a
panacea that would save parents
huge sums in dental bills, while
costing almost nothing, requiring
no effort, and involving absolutely
no risk. Unfortunately, none of
these glowing claims are
supported by substantial amounts
of unambiguous scientific

evidence. For example, the
often -heard claim that
fluoridation reduces tooth decay
"an average of 60%" is not
supported by a single properly
controlled experiment.
Written By Faculty
The "con" argument, written
by several faculty members, none
of them scientists, concisely
presented the case for alternative
methods of preventing decay, but
in the face of the fraudulent
promotional claims put out by the
"pro" side, the argument wasn't
very convincing. The vote,
predictably, went about 9-1 in
favor of fluoridation. (In this
respect, Stanford was unusual.
Fluoridation is often imposed
upon people without a vote, and
when it does get onto the ballot,
the measure usually loses.
Fluoridation has been defeated in
46 of 60 such elections in
California.)
The highly biased manner in
which fluoridation was presented
at Stanford did not originate here;
rather, it is unfortunately typical
of the style in which fluoridation
has been promoted for twenty
years. It is unlikely that Dr.
Aronow was being intentionally
deceitful; he was merely spouting
distorted claims that have been
repeated so many times that a
majority of those who hear them
accept them as fact.
Few doctors and scientists can
spend the time it takes to go to
the Lane Library and carefully
pore over all the original research
on which the fluoridation
program is supposed to be based.
Most professionals read an
occasional review article, and
accept the opinions of "experts"
such as the USPHS.
Unfortunately, the "experts" are
deeply involved in the promotion
of the measure, and usually
present a highly biased account.
Scrutiny of Literature
Close scrutiny of the early
fluoridation literature reveals that
it is a collection of some of the
poorest research ever published.
There has never been solid proof
that fluoridation is either very
effective against tooth decay or
free of undesirable side effects. In

fact, when the Public Health
Service went ahead and endorsed
fluoridation in 1951, evidence of
the value of the program was
incredibly scanty.
In the next decade, the PHS
vigorously promoted fluoridation
on a nationwide basis; at the same
time, the same agency conducted
research to "prove" that
fluoridation, which they were
trying so hard to sell, was both
effective and safe. (Most of the
experiments that were carried out
during this period were so poorly
designed that the results are
virtually meaningless.)
What it all boils down to is
this: a small group of "experts"
has decided that fluoridation is a
blessing that everyone should
enjoy; to attain this goal, they
have employed tactics of
distortion, propaganda, and smear
campaigns. While I might agree
with the goal of eliminating tooth
decay, I just can't condone such
tactics.
To the extent that he doesn't
adversely affect the lives of
others, each individual should
have control over his own life.
One minor aspect of this life is the
amount of fluoride he consumes
each day. We should consider
anything more than a minute
trace of fluoride, in the water or
in the air, as a pollutant: it's
something that shouldn't be there,
and something that affects us in a
manner we cannot control.
Whatever beneficial effects
fluoride may have can readily be
obtained at lower cost and with
less risk, if the individual chooses
to do so. Why, then, should we
allow more of this pollutant to be
casually added to our
environment? Why have it forced
down our throats?

literature on fluoridation and
related topics; in addition, the
manner in which fluoridation is
promoted and sold to the public
leads me to question the worth of
the procedure.
Tooth decay, its causes and
prevention, is a complicated and
highly variable process which
involves far more than the simple
presence or absence of the
fluoride ion in the drinking water.
Fluoride is certainly not necessary
to prevent cavities, although it
does have some effect in making
teeth more resistant to decay.
However, fluoride is also an
extremely toxic substance; even at
very low concentrations, the ion is
accumulated in the body, and
may, over time, do serious
damage.
Dental Benefits
Assuming one wants the dental
benefits of fluoride, but would
prefer not to risk long-term side
effects, there are several ways to
administer fluoride without
dumping it in the water supply.
Tablets can be taken on an
individual basis at home; dentists
can give private treatments; and
there is now a super-strong
fluoride toothpaste, one
application of which will last a
whole year, which is being
administered at grade-school
"brush-ins." All of these options
are readily available to Stanford
residents.
Among the many alternatives,
fluoridation of community water
supplies is least desirable for the
following (among other) reasons:
Fluoridation costs up to
twenty times what some of the
alternatives would cost.
Ninety-nine per cent of the
water supply is used for purposes
other than human consumption,
so most of the fluoride goes down
the drain.
Although children are expected
to derive the most benefit from
fluoridation, people of all ages are
subjected to the potential risk.
Individuals drink widely
different amounts of water,
making controlled or uniform
dosage of fluoride impossible.
Fluoridation forces everyone
to consume a potentially toxic
substance, whether or not he
wants to or needs to. (Or it forces
him to buy bottled water, at extra
expense.)

The possibility of long-term
toxic effects has not been
satisfactorily resolved.
Last Point Crucial
This last point is crucial.
Although there is not yet much
really solid evidence that fluoride
at one part per million causes
serious trouble, there is definite
proof that levels only slightly
higher, consumed day after day,
can be extremely damaging in the
long run.
Recent research by a Canadian
group showed that foods and
beverages prepared with
fluoridated water contained
enough fluoride to raise an
individual's daily dose into a range
considered hazardous after several
years. As more and more cities
adopt fluoridation, more foods
will be processed in fluoridated
water, and the average amount of
fluoride in our diets very likely
will increase.
Just as it has taken a long time
to document the damage done by
DDT, it will take many years of
competent research to
demonstrate the effects of chronic
low-level fluoride ingestion on
human beings. A lack of such
basis knowledge is reason to be
extremely cautious about
increasing the amount of fluoride
in he environment; yet the U.S.
Public Health Service has been
enthusiastically promoting
fluoridation, and has tended to
ignore evidence (such as the
information on fluoride content
of foods) which would argue
against fluoridation.
Balancing Potential Risks
The decision to fluoride or not
to do so involves balancing
potential risks against possible
benefits. When the public has to
make such a risk-benefit decision
at the ballot box, it is essential
that both sides be presented fairly
and objectively.
Fluoridation was touted as a
panacea that would save parents
huge sums in dental bills, while
costing almost nothing, requiring
no effort, and involving absolutely
no risk. Unfortunately, none of
these glowing claims are
supported by substantial amounts
of unambiguous scientific

evidence. For example, the
often -heard claim that
fluoridation reduces tooth decay
"an average of 60%" is not
supported by a single properly
controlled experiment.
Written By Faculty
The "con" argument, written
by several faculty members, none
of them scientists, concisely
presented the case for alternative
methods of preventing decay, but
in the face of the fraudulent
promotional claims put out by the
"pro" side, the argument wasn't
very convincing. The vote,
predictably, went about 9-1 in
favor of fluoridation. (In this
respect, Stanford was unusual.
Fluoridation is often imposed
upon people without a vote, and
when it does get onto the ballot,
the measure usually loses.
Fluoridation has been defeated in
46 of 60 such elections in
California.)
The highly biased manner in
which fluoridation was presented
at Stanford did not originate here;
rather, it is unfortunately typical
of the style in which fluoridation
has been promoted for twenty
years. It is unlikely that Dr.
Aronow was being intentionally
deceitful; he was merely spouting
distorted claims that have been
repeated so many times that a
majority of those who hear them
accept them as fact.
Few doctors and scientists can
spend the time it takes to go to
the Lane Library and carefully
pore over all the original research
on which the fluoridation
program is supposed to be based.
Most professionals read an
occasional review article, and
accept the opinions of "experts"
such as the USPHS.
Unfortunately, the "experts" are
deeply involved in the promotion
of the measure, and usually
present a highly biased account.
Scrutiny of Literature
Close scrutiny of the early
fluoridation literature reveals that
it is a collection of some of the
poorest research ever published.
There has never been solid proof
that fluoridation is either very
effective against tooth decay or
free of undesirable side effects. In

fact, when the Public Health
Service went ahead and endorsed
fluoridation in 1951, evidence of
the value of the program was
incredibly scanty.
In the next decade, the PHS
vigorously promoted fluoridation
on a nationwide basis; at the same
time, the same agency conducted
research to "prove" that
fluoridation, which they were
trying so hard to sell, was both
effective and safe. (Most of the
experiments that were carried out
during this period were so poorly
designed that the results are
virtually meaningless.)
What it all boils down to is
this: a small group of "experts"
has decided that fluoridation is a
blessing that everyone should
enjoy; to attain this goal, they
have employed tactics of
distortion, propaganda, and smear
campaigns. While I might agree
with the goal of eliminating tooth
decay, I just can't condone such
tactics.
To the extent that he doesn't
adversely affect the lives of
others, each individual should
have control over his own life.
One minor aspect of this life is the
amount of fluoride he consumes
each day. We should consider
anything more than a minute
trace of fluoride, in the water or
in the air, as a pollutant: it's
something that shouldn't be there,
and something that affects us in a
manner we cannot control.
Whatever beneficial effects
fluoride may have can readily be
obtained at lower cost and with
less risk, if the individual chooses
to do so. Why, then, should we
allow more of this pollutant to be
casually added to our
environment? Why have it forced
down our throats?

extremely toxic substance; even at
very low concentrations, the ion is
accumulated in the body, and
may, over time, do serious
damage.
Dental Benefits
Assuming one wants the dental
benefits of fluoride, but would
prefer not to risk long-term side
effects, there are several ways to
administer fluoride without
dumping it in the water supply.
Tablets can be taken on an
individual basis at home; dentists
can give private treatments; and
there is now a super-strong
fluoride toothpaste, one
application of which will last a
whole year, which is being
administered at grade-school
"brush-ins." All of these options
are readily available to Stanford
residents.
Among the many alternatives,
fluoridation of community water
supplies is least desirable for the
following (among other) reasons:
Fluoridation costs up to
twenty times what some of the
alternatives would cost.
Ninety-nine per cent of the
water supply is used for purposes
other than human consumption,
so most of the fluoride goes down
the drain.
Although children are expected
to derive the most benefit from
fluoridation, people of all ages are
subjected to the potential risk.
Individuals drink widely
different amounts of water,
making controlled or uniform
dosage of fluoride impossible.
Fluoridation forces everyone
to consume a potentially toxic
substance, whether or not he
wants to or needs to. (Or it forces
him to buy bottled water, at extra
expense.)

The possibility of long-term
toxic effects has not been
satisfactorily resolved.
Last Point Crucial
This last point is crucial.
Although there is not yet much
really solid evidence that fluoride
at one part per million causes
serious trouble, there is definite
proof that levels only slightly
higher, consumed day after day,
can be extremely damaging in the
long run.
Recent research by a Canadian
group showed that foods and
beverages prepared with
fluoridated water contained
enough fluoride to raise an
individual's daily dose into a range
considered hazardous after several
years. As more and more cities
adopt fluoridation, more foods
will be processed in fluoridated
water, and the average amount of
fluoride in our diets very likely
will increase.
Just as it has taken a long time
to document the damage done by
DDT, it will take many years of
competent research to
demonstrate the effects of chronic
low-level fluoride ingestion on
human beings. A lack of such
basis knowledge is reason to be
extremely cautious about
increasing the amount of fluoride
in he environment; yet the U.S.
Public Health Service has been
enthusiastically promoting
fluoridation, and has tended to
ignore evidence (such as the
information on fluoride content
of foods) which would argue
against fluoridation.
Balancing Potential Risks
The decision to fluoride or not
to do so involves balancing
potential risks against possible
benefits. When the public has to
make such a risk-benefit decision
at the ballot box, it is essential
that both sides be presented fairly
and objectively.
Fluoridation was touted as a
panacea that would save parents
huge sums in dental bills, while
costing almost nothing, requiring
no effort, and involving absolutely
no risk. Unfortunately, none of
these glowing claims are
supported by substantial amounts
of unambiguous scientific

evidence. For example, the
often -heard claim that
fluoridation reduces tooth decay
"an average of 60%" is not
supported by a single properly
controlled experiment.
Written By Faculty
The "con" argument, written
by several faculty members, none
of them scientists, concisely
presented the case for alternative
methods of preventing decay, but
in the face of the fraudulent
promotional claims put out by the
"pro" side, the argument wasn't
very convincing. The vote,
predictably, went about 9-1 in
favor of fluoridation. (In this
respect, Stanford was unusual.
Fluoridation is often imposed
upon people without a vote, and
when it does get onto the ballot,
the measure usually loses.
Fluoridation has been defeated in
46 of 60 such elections in
California.)
The highly biased manner in
which fluoridation was presented
at Stanford did not originate here;
rather, it is unfortunately typical
of the style in which fluoridation
has been promoted for twenty
years. It is unlikely that Dr.
Aronow was being intentionally
deceitful; he was merely spouting
distorted claims that have been
repeated so many times that a
majority of those who hear them
accept them as fact.
Few doctors and scientists can
spend the time it takes to go to
the Lane Library and carefully
pore over all the original research
on which the fluoridation
program is supposed to be based.
Most professionals read an
occasional review article, and
accept the opinions of "experts"
such as the USPHS.
Unfortunately, the "experts" are
deeply involved in the promotion
of the measure, and usually
present a highly biased account.
Scrutiny of Literature
Close scrutiny of the early
fluoridation literature reveals that
it is a collection of some of the
poorest research ever published.
There has never been solid proof
that fluoridation is either very
effective against tooth decay or
free of undesirable side effects. In

fact, when the Public Health
Service went ahead and endorsed
fluoridation in 1951, evidence of
the value of the program was
incredibly scanty.
In the next decade, the PHS
vigorously promoted fluoridation
on a nationwide basis; at the same
time, the same agency conducted
research to "prove" that
fluoridation, which they were
trying so hard to sell, was both
effective and safe. (Most of the
experiments that were carried out
during this period were so poorly
designed that the results are
virtually meaningless.)
What it all boils down to is
this: a small group of "experts"
has decided that fluoridation is a
blessing that everyone should
enjoy; to attain this goal, they
have employed tactics of
distortion, propaganda, and smear
campaigns. While I might agree
with the goal of eliminating tooth
decay, I just can't condone such
tactics.
To the extent that he doesn't
adversely affect the lives of
others, each individual should
have control over his own life.
One minor aspect of this life is the
amount of fluoride he consumes
each day. We should consider
anything more than a minute
trace of fluoride, in the water or
in the air, as a pollutant: it's
something that shouldn't be there,
and something that affects us in a
manner we cannot control.
Whatever beneficial effects
fluoride may have can readily be
obtained at lower cost and with
less risk, if the individual chooses
to do so. Why, then, should we
allow more of this pollutant to be
casually added to our
environment? Why have it forced
down our throats?

The Daily of May 23 carried
the news that campus
homeowners and Escondido
tenants will be blessed with
fluoridated drinking water,
starting late in the summer or
sometime in the fall. Perhaps this
is locking the barn door after,
etc., but I feel obligated to state
my strenuous objection to the
addition of fluoride to drinking
water, even for the laudable
purpose of reducing tooth decay.
My objections are based on
several months of thorough
evaluation of the scientific
literature on fluoridation and
related topics; in addition, the
manner in which fluoridation is
promoted and sold to the public
leads me to question the worth of
the procedure.
Tooth decay, its causes and
prevention, is a complicated and
highly variable process which
involves far more than the simple
presence or absence of the
fluoride ion in the drinking water.
Fluoride is certainly not necessary
to prevent cavities, although it
does have some effect in making
teeth more resistant to decay.
However, fluoride is also an
extremely toxic substance; even at
very low concentrations, the ion is
accumulated in the body, and
may, over time, do serious
damage.

application of which will last a
whole year, which is being
administered at grade-school
"brush-ins." All of these options
are readily available to Stanford
residents.
Among the many alternatives,
fluoridation of community water
supplies is least desirable for the
following (among other) reasons:
Fluoridation costs up to
twenty times what some of the
alternatives would cost.
Ninety-nine per cent of the
water supply is used for purposes
other than human consumption,
so most of the fluoride goes down
the drain.
Although children are expected
to derive the most benefit from
fluoridation, people of all ages are
subjected to the potential risk.
Individuals drink widely
different amounts of water,
making controlled or uniform
dosage of fluoride impossible.
Fluoridation forces everyone
to consume a potentially toxic
substance, whether or not he
wants to or needs to. (Or it forces
him to buy bottled water, at extra
expense.)

The possibility of long-term
toxic effects has not been
satisfactorily resolved.
Last Point Crucial
This last point is crucial.
Although there is not yet much
really solid evidence that fluoride
at one part per million causes
serious trouble, there is definite
proof that levels only slightly
higher, consumed day after day,
can be extremely damaging in the
long run.
Recent research by a Canadian
group showed that foods and
beverages prepared with
fluoridated water contained
enough fluoride to raise an
individual's daily dose into a range
considered hazardous after several
years. As more and more cities
adopt fluoridation, more foods
will be processed in fluoridated
water, and the average amount of
fluoride in our diets very likely
will increase.
Just as it has taken a long time
to document the damage done by
DDT, it will take many years of
competent research to
demonstrate the effects of chronic
low-level fluoride ingestion on
human beings. A lack of such
basis knowledge is reason to be
extremely cautious about
increasing the amount of fluoride
in he environment; yet the U.S.
Public Health Service has been
enthusiastically promoting
fluoridation, and has tended to
ignore evidence (such as the
information on fluoride content
of foods) which would argue
against fluoridation.
Balancing Potential Risks
The decision to fluoride or not
to do so involves balancing
potential risks against possible
benefits. When the public has to
make such a risk-benefit decision
at the ballot box, it is essential
that both sides be presented fairly
and objectively.
Fluoridation was touted as a
panacea that would save parents
huge sums in dental bills, while
costing almost nothing, requiring
no effort, and involving absolutely
no risk. Unfortunately, none of
these glowing claims are
supported by substantial amounts
of unambiguous scientific

evidence. For example, the
often -heard claim that
fluoridation reduces tooth decay
"an average of 60%" is not
supported by a single properly
controlled experiment.
Written By Faculty
The "con" argument, written
by several faculty members, none
of them scientists, concisely
presented the case for alternative
methods of preventing decay, but
in the face of the fraudulent
promotional claims put out by the
"pro" side, the argument wasn't
very convincing. The vote,
predictably, went about 9-1 in
favor of fluoridation. (In this
respect, Stanford was unusual.
Fluoridation is often imposed
upon people without a vote, and
when it does get onto the ballot,
the measure usually loses.
Fluoridation has been defeated in
46 of 60 such elections in
California.)
The highly biased manner in
which fluoridation was presented
at Stanford did not originate here;
rather, it is unfortunately typical
of the style in which fluoridation
has been promoted for twenty
years. It is unlikely that Dr.
Aronow was being intentionally
deceitful; he was merely spouting
distorted claims that have been
repeated so many times that a
majority of those who hear them
accept them as fact.
Few doctors and scientists can
spend the time it takes to go to
the Lane Library and carefully
pore over all the original research
on which the fluoridation
program is supposed to be based.
Most professionals read an
occasional review article, and
accept the opinions of "experts"
such as the USPHS.
Unfortunately, the "experts" are
deeply involved in the promotion
of the measure, and usually
present a highly biased account.
Scrutiny of Literature
Close scrutiny of the early
fluoridation literature reveals that
it is a collection of some of the
poorest research ever published.
There has never been solid proof
that fluoridation is either very
effective against tooth decay or
free of undesirable side effects. In

fact, when the Public Health
Service went ahead and endorsed
fluoridation in 1951, evidence of
the value of the program was
incredibly scanty.
In the next decade, the PHS
vigorously promoted fluoridation
on a nationwide basis; at the same
time, the same agency conducted
research to "prove" that
fluoridation, which they were
trying so hard to sell, was both
effective and safe. (Most of the
experiments that were carried out
during this period were so poorly
designed that the results are
virtually meaningless.)
What it all boils down to is
this: a small group of "experts"
has decided that fluoridation is a
blessing that everyone should
enjoy; to attain this goal, they
have employed tactics of
distortion, propaganda, and smear
campaigns. While I might agree
with the goal of eliminating tooth
decay, I just can't condone such
tactics.
To the extent that he doesn't
adversely affect the lives of
others, each individual should
have control over his own life.
One minor aspect of this life is the
amount of fluoride he consumes
each day. We should consider
anything more than a minute
trace of fluoride, in the water or
in the air, as a pollutant: it's
something that shouldn't be there,
and something that affects us in a
manner we cannot control.
Whatever beneficial effects
fluoride may have can readily be
obtained at lower cost and with
less risk, if the individual chooses
to do so. Why, then, should we
allow more of this pollutant to be
casually added to our
environment? Why have it forced
down our throats?

The Daily of May 23 carried
the news that campus
homeowners and Escondido
tenants will be blessed with
fluoridated drinking water,
starting late in the summer or
sometime in the fall. Perhaps this
is locking the barn door after,
etc., but I feel obligated to state
my strenuous objection to the
addition of fluoride to drinking
water, even for the laudable
purpose of reducing tooth decay.
My objections are based on
several months of thorough
evaluation of the scientific
literature on fluoridation and
related topics; in addition, the
manner in which fluoridation is
promoted and sold to the public
leads me to question the worth of
the procedure.
Tooth decay, its causes and
prevention, is a complicated and
highly variable process which
involves far more than the simple
presence or absence of the
fluoride ion in the drinking water.
Fluoride is certainly not necessary
to prevent cavities, although it
does have some effect in making
teeth more resistant to decay.
However, fluoride is also an
extremely toxic substance; even at
very low concentrations, the ion is
accumulated in the body, and
may, over time, do serious
damage.
Dental Benefits
Assuming one wants the dental
benefits of fluoride, but would
prefer not to risk long-term side
effects, there are several ways to
administer fluoride without
dumping it in the water supply.
Tablets can be taken on an
individual basis at home; dentists
can give private treatments; and
there is now a super-strong
fluoride toothpaste, one
application of which will last a
whole year, which is being
administered at grade-school
"brush-ins." All of these options
are readily available to Stanford
residents.
