Editor, THE DAILY:
The decision to affiliate
Stanford Employees Assn. to
CSEA has never been thorojighly
discussed. The decision tc a
constitution, written by dSEA
was made in an emotionally
charged meeting by many workers
who had never been to a previous
meeting. They had never been
exposed to a discussion of the
issues.
I would abide by the majority
decisions of a group provided
those decisions were
democratically arrived at by an
informed membership. This was
not possible at the last meeting.
Especially since these decisions
involve the basic structure of
CSEA, I am unable to accept
them.
I do not recognize the validity
of decisions made by an executive
committee, most of whom were
not elected to their present
position. I do not believe that
SEA as presently constituted and
as controlled by Burlingame-based
CSEA can build an organization

representative of all constitutents
of employees at Stanford.
I disagree with CSEA in its
fundamental concepts of the role
and function of an employee
organization. As a union we must
concentrate on satisfying the basic
economic needs of workers.
However the satisfaction of these
needs cannot be totally divorced
from the economic and social life
of the community. We must take
individual and collective
responsibility for improving the
economic, social and intellectual
life of the employees at Stanford.
We have among Stanford
employees all the technical
resources, all the organizational
talents we need to build a
democratic union which will
represent the needs of the varied
segments of employees at
Stanford. I am confident that
such an organization can and will
be built.
