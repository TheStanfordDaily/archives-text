# Sounds Like Summer
## Chamber Music In Dink 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
This past weekend, Dinkelspiel Auditorium
glowed with the timeless beauty of the chamber
concert. On Friday night, the Stanford Renaissance
Band presented "Music from the Court of Lorenzo
the Magnificent," amid the buzz of shawms and
crumhorns, and the grace of recorders and lutes.
And on Thursday, Saturday and Sunday, the
exciting Guarneri String Quartet blended an
incomparable ensemble sound, as clear and mellow
as can be imagined.
Stanford Renaissance Hand
Today's shibboleth is "relevancy," and as I sat
listening to the Renaissance music, in this enclave in
a hate-torn planet, I reflected on what this music,
written so long ago for such a different world, could
say to me.
I think it gives me a better sense of perspective,
looking back to Florence, perhaps the last center
where the creations of man were n object enough.
It was a life beset by its own special fears of the
unknown, a set unlike ours, which we have created
for ourselves. The music reflects this difference. It is
not hurried or forced; it is subdued, ordered,
carefully contemplated music, written for an age
when time was for creating, not getting places.
The performance must have pleased the King, for
today we know both the music and the instruments.
It should be pleasing to us, to know what it was that
other eras valued, for there are things there which
we might re-discover as valuable.
Go to the next concert this Saturday, close your
eyes with the music all around you, and feel this
world fading away. A sense of history makes a man
feel terribly, terribly small, and his everyday
problems seem even smaller. Renaissance music is
truly a refreshing experience.
Guarneri String Quartet
The Guarneri String Quartet filled Dinkelspiel
with beauty at each performance, the ensemble of
full, rich, complementary voices that makes this a
great string quartet. Their manner has an
introspective quality, which was enhanced by the
inclusion of pieces by Beethoven, Mozart,
Schumann and William Klenz, a new American
composer, in their repetoire.
The Guarneri seems to feel music very deeply,

and the impression is strongest in young Arnold
Steinhardt, the outstanding first violinist. He is
among the finest chamber musicians I have ever
heard, and he certainly looks the part of the
vitruoso on stage, with hair flying, challenging
posture and forceful attack.
John Dalley plays a clear, although cautious,
second violin, and Michael Tree is the rather
subdued violist. David Soyer is on 'cello, providing
the firm foundation supporting the mellow sound of
the Guarneri Quartet in ensemble.
This cooperation in tone and technique has been
achieved early by the Guarneri, who have been
playing together just five years. Their degree of
achievement was strikingly demonstrated in the
Schumann Quartet No. 3, which requires that four
men play as one, completely understanding each
other.
The modern pieces played at these three
concerts, the Hindemith Quartet No. 3, the Bartok
Quartet No. 4, and the Klenz Quartet No. 1 (written
just two years ago, and especially for the Guarneri),
were the highlights of the performances.
These works are extremely challenging, from the
standpoints of both technique and interpretation.
They were each highly expressive and emotional,
speaking of the passions and fears of modern man
through this centuries-old vehicle of the string
quartet.
The thought struck me, how amazing it is that an
instrument perfected in the 18th century, based on
a tradition stretching even farther back, could : till
speak for man, for the composer in his room, for
the performers on the stage, and for the participant
in the audience.
The Guarneri concerts were a delight, and were
clearly well-appreciated by the audience, who called
the Quartet back for an encore at each performance.
Opening the music events of the Stanford Summer
Festival with a set of performances as enduring and
as immediate as these Guarneri concerts was an
excellent choice.
For those who missed these concerts, or those
who would like to relive them, the Guarneri String
Quartet already has a number of excellent albums
on RCA Victor, with others scheduled for release
within the year.
