# Radicals Convene
## Views Differ In SDS National 
### KAREN DAVIDSON 
On Saturday morning, June 28,
the membership of the Stanford
chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society met in
Tresidder Union to assimilate the
experiences brought back by
those who attended the SDS
national convention in Chicago
earlier this month.
To provide background for the
disputes which arose at the
convention, Stanford SDS
member Lenny Siegel offered a
brief outline of the history of
SDS. The organization grew out
of the Norman Thomas-socialist
League for Industrial Democracy.
It rapidly became qualitatively
different from the social
democrats in its politics. The Port
Huron Statement, a major critique
of corporate liberalism and a
defining document of the early

SDS, outlines a "third camp"
socialist position opposing
existing capitalist and communist
societies.
Following the historical
briefing, a description of the
major factions represented at the
convention was given. Bill Klingel,
an SDS member who attended the
convention, identified the three
main factions at the convention as
the Progressive Labor Party, the
Revolutionary Youth Movement,
and a number of independent
groupings.
' The political line of the
Progressive Labor Party (PL)
states that all nationalism is
reactionary, including that of
Third World countries, and that
the main contradiction in the
world today concerns the struggle
of the working class and the ruling
class.

Following the PL ideology, the
question of black liberation can
be understood only in terms of
class struggle. PL holds that blacks
are "workers with a suntan," and
their slogan is "Black and
White—unite and fight."
PL identifies womens'
liberation in the same terms;
"Women are workers with
breasts" and are exploited at the
work place.
The Progressive Labor party
will not support any struggle
which viewed in the light of their
Marxist-Leninist theory does not
lead directly to seizing state
power.
The second major faction at
the convention was the
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM). This group had two
components: the "weatherman"
group, which won the three
national offices at this
convention, and the National
Office collective (the former
national officers).
The "weatherman" group,
which took its name from Bob
Dylan's lyric: "You don't need a
weatherman to know which way
the wind blows," places an
emphasis on youth "wild in the
streets"; while the national office
was closer to the Marxist-Leninist
doctrine of the industrial
proletariat as the most important
element in making the revolution.
Both components are in basic
agreement, favoring a disciplined
central organization, the idea of a
vanguard party, total support for
black and Third World liberation
struggles, and a united front
qainst imperialism.

Of the approximately twenty
delegates attending the
convention from Stanford, most
adhere to either the New Left
Independent position or the
position taken by the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union. Both
groupings opposed PL's
"obstructionist" tactics at the
convention.
The "New Leftists" concern
themselves with the organization
of American society whose
traditional exploitation of the
masses through imperialistic,
profit-maximizing activity in the
Third World and at home has
made any and all humanistic
♦ p n H en cies virtually impossible.
A "power to the people" type
of social organization is advocated
by the New Leftists, who feel that
the bureaucratic hierarchy of the
existing political structure is an
evil which should be replaced by
allocation of power to the
members of the community.
New Leftist Fred Cohen
asserts: "We do not want to build
an organization, but a movement.
Organization must always be
subordinate in importance to the
Movement."
The Revolutionary Union
differs from the New Leftists in
both theory and organization. The
RU adheres to a Marxist-Leninist
doctrine of the struggle of the
workers who, according to their
theory, tend to be the most
revolutionary because they are the
most exploited.
Although both PL and the RU

maintain Marxist-Leninist
ideologies and both admire Mao
Tse-tung, the RU supports the
black liberation struggle as a link
between the anti-imperialist
struggle and the class struggle.
The RU looks toward the
eventual formation of a national
Marxist-Leninist party, when the
conditions are appropriate.
Bill Klingel pointed out at the
meeting in Tresidder that thought
the New Left faction was the
smallest at the convention it
represents the largest group in the
membership of SDS.

briefing, a description of the
major factions represented at the
convention was given. Bill Klingel,
an SDS member who attended the
convention, identified the three
main factions at the convention as
the Progressive Labor Party, the
Revolutionary Youth Movement,
and a number of independent
groupings.
' The political line of the
Progressive Labor Party (PL)
states that all nationalism is
reactionary, including that of
Third World countries, and that
the main contradiction in the
world today concerns the struggle
of the working class and the ruling
class.

Following the PL ideology, the
question of black liberation can
be understood only in terms of
class struggle. PL holds that blacks
are "workers with a suntan," and
their slogan is "Black and
White—unite and fight."
PL identifies womens'
liberation in the same terms;
"Women are workers with
breasts" and are exploited at the
work place.
The Progressive Labor party
will not support any struggle
which viewed in the light of their
Marxist-Leninist theory does not
lead directly to seizing state
power.
The second major faction at
the convention was the
Revolutionary Youth Movement
(RYM). This group had two
components: the "weatherman"
group, which won the three
national offices at this
convention, and the National
Office collective (the former
national officers).
The "weatherman" group,
which took its name from Bob
Dylan's lyric: "You don't need a
weatherman to know which way
the wind blows," places an
emphasis on youth "wild in the
streets"; while the national office
was closer to the Marxist-Leninist
doctrine of the industrial
proletariat as the most important
element in making the revolution.
Both components are in basic
agreement, favoring a disciplined
central organization, the idea of a
vanguard party, total support for
black and Third World liberation
struggles, and a united front
qainst imperialism.

Of the approximately twenty
delegates attending the
convention from Stanford, most
adhere to either the New Left
Independent position or the
position taken by the Bay Area
Revolutionary Union. Both
groupings opposed PL's
"obstructionist" tactics at the
convention.
The "New Leftists" concern
themselves with the organization
of American society whose
traditional exploitation of the
masses through imperialistic,
profit-maximizing activity in the
Third World and at home has
made any and all humanistic
♦ p n H en cies virtually impossible.
A "power to the people" type
of social organization is advocated
by the New Leftists, who feel that
the bureaucratic hierarchy of the
existing political structure is an
evil which should be replaced by
allocation of power to the
members of the community.
New Leftist Fred Cohen
asserts: "We do not want to build
an organization, but a movement.
Organization must always be
subordinate in importance to the
Movement."
The Revolutionary Union
differs from the New Leftists in
both theory and organization. The
RU adheres to a Marxist-Leninist
doctrine of the struggle of the
workers who, according to their
theory, tend to be the most
revolutionary because they are the
most exploited.
Although both PL and the RU

maintain Marxist-Leninist
ideologies and both admire Mao
Tse-tung, the RU supports the
black liberation struggle as a link
between the anti-imperialist
struggle and the class struggle.
The RU looks toward the
eventual formation of a national
Marxist-Leninist party, when the
conditions are appropriate.
Bill Klingel pointed out at the
meeting in Tresidder that thought
the New Left faction was the
smallest at the convention it
represents the largest group in the
membership of SDS.
On Saturday morning, June 28,
the membership of the Stanford
chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society met in
Tresidder Union to assimilate the
experiences brought back by
those who attended the SDS
national convention in Chicago
earlier this month.
To provide background for the
disputes which arose at the
convention, Stanford SDS
member Lenny Siegel offered a
brief outline of the history of
SDS. The organization grew out
of the Norman Thomas-socialist
League for Industrial Democracy.
It rapidly became qualitatively
different from the social
democrats in its politics. The Port
Huron Statement, a major critique
of corporate liberalism and a
defining document of the early

SDS, outlines a "third camp"
socialist position opposing
existing capitalist and communist
societies.
