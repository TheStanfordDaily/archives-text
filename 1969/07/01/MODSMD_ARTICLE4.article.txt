Freeman, a Keynsian
economist and frequent
contributor to William Buckley's
National Review served on the
White House staff during 1955-56;
as Vice President of the Institute
for Social Science Research,
Washington D.C. from 1957-61; as
research director of the Institute
for Studies in Federalism at
Clarmont Men's College during
1961-62; and in various other
governmental and
nongovernmental positions such
as Chairman of»the State and
Local Advisory Committee to the
U.S. Bureau of the Census.
In 1967, Freeman was awarded
a George Washington Honor
Medal for 1966 by the Freedoms
Foundation of Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania.
Freeman has been outspoken
on several occasions on his views
of the rcfle of the government and
of the economics of education.
In a speech given to the San
Diego Open Forum on Jan. 9,
1966, he discussed big
government by stating,
"Conservatives and liberals alike
recognize that in the second half
of the 20th century the
government of an industrial
nation, and a world leader at that,
must be Big Government."
"What divides liberals and
conservatives," Freeman
continued, "is not so much their
views on the necessary or
desirable magnitude of public
spending as a conflict on the ends
and means of government."
Advocates Tax Credits
Discussing the government's
role in higher education in a

speech on May 24, 1966, Freeman
declared, "Federal income tax
credits for college expenses and
donations are the most effective
way by which the national
government can aid higher
education."
"In fact," stated Freeman,
"they are the only methods by
which the federal goverment can
assist with the most crucial
problem in college finance: how
to supply the institutions with
funds to hire not only more
teachers but to attract to the
academic profession the nation's
most talentedmen and women."
Freeman was widely
recognized at the time as one of
the principal proponents of the
tax credit plan, which had been
strongly opposed by Stanford
representatives to the American
Council on Education and other
education groups.
An expert in the economics of
education, Freeman does not, on
the other hand, believe that
compensatory education can
successfully remedy the
achievement problems facing
lower schools.
Monumental Failure
"Compensatory education," he
stated, "has been shown to be a
'monumental failure."
"If compensatory programs,"
he wrote in the Wall Street
Journal, June 8, 1968, "could
raise children who lag in the basic
skills to significantly higher levels,
billions of dollars annually would
be a cheap price to pay."
"But there is not a shred of
evidence to date to lend support
to the near land-slide acceptance
(of) compensatory programs."

Past activities of the Hoover
director have included serving as
an advisor to Senator Barry
Goldwater during the 1964
presidential campaign; as a
founding -member on the
executive board of the Center for
Strategic Studies, Georgetown
University in 1962; and as
co-director for a Senate report on

Freeman, a Keynsian
economist and frequent
contributor to William Buckley's
National Review served on the
White House staff during 1955-56;
as Vice President of the Institute
for Social Science Research,
Washington D.C. from 1957-61; as

U.S. Bureau of the Census.
In 1967, Freeman was awarded
a George Washington Honor
Medal for 1966 by the Freedoms
Foundation of Valley Forge,
Pennsylvania.
Freeman has been outspoken
on several occasions on his views
of the rcfle of the government and
of the economics of education.
In a speech given to the San
Diego Open Forum on Jan. 9,
1966, he discussed big
government by stating,
"Conservatives and liberals alike
recognize that in the second half
of the 20th century the
government of an industrial
nation, and a world leader at that,
must be Big Government."
"What divides liberals and
conservatives," Freeman
continued, "is not so much their
views on the necessary or
desirable magnitude of public
spending as a conflict on the ends
and means of government."
Advocates Tax Credits
Discussing the government's
role in higher education in a

speech on May 24, 1966, Freeman
declared, "Federal income tax
credits for college expenses and
donations are the most effective
way by which the national
government can aid higher
education."
"In fact," stated Freeman,
"they are the only methods by
which the federal goverment can
assist with the most crucial
problem in college finance: how
to supply the institutions with
funds to hire not only more
teachers but to attract to the
academic profession the nation's
most talentedmen and women."
Freeman was widely
recognized at the time as one of
the principal proponents of the
tax credit plan, which had been
strongly opposed by Stanford
representatives to the American
Council on Education and other
education groups.
An expert in the economics of
education, Freeman does not, on
the other hand, believe that
compensatory education can
successfully remedy the
achievement problems facing
lower schools.
Monumental Failure
"Compensatory education," he
stated, "has been shown to be a
'monumental failure."
"If compensatory programs,"
he wrote in the Wall Street
Journal, June 8, 1968, "could
raise children who lag in the basic
skills to significantly higher levels,
billions of dollars annually would
be a cheap price to pay."
"But there is not a shred of
evidence to date to lend support
to the near land-slide acceptance
(of) compensatory programs."

recognized at the time as one of
the principal proponents of the
tax credit plan, which had been
strongly opposed by Stanford
representatives to the American
Council on Education and other
education groups.
An expert in the economics of
education, Freeman does not, on
the other hand, believe that
compensatory education can
successfully remedy the
achievement problems facing
lower schools.
Monumental Failure
"Compensatory education," he
stated, "has been shown to be a
'monumental failure."
"If compensatory programs,"
he wrote in the Wall Street
Journal, June 8, 1968, "could
raise children who lag in the basic
skills to significantly higher levels,
billions of dollars annually would
be a cheap price to pay."
"But there is not a shred of
evidence to date to lend support
to the near land-slide acceptance
(of) compensatory programs."

13-man panel, Campbell assisted
in selecting the new Fellows from
30 national finalists.
Campbell, directed of the
Hoover Institution since 1960, is
also a member of the University
of California Board of Regents
and an alternate member of the
California Coordinating Council
on Higher Education.

on several occasions on his views
of the rcfle of the government and
of the economics of education.
In a speech given to the San
Diego Open Forum on Jan. 9,
1966, he discussed big
government by stating,
"Conservatives and liberals alike
recognize that in the second half
of the 20th century the
government of an industrial
nation, and a world leader at that,
must be Big Government."
"What divides liberals and
conservatives," Freeman
continued, "is not so much their
views on the necessary or
desirable magnitude of public
spending as a conflict on the ends
and means of government."
Advocates Tax Credits
Discussing the government's
role in higher education in a

speech on May 24, 1966, Freeman
declared, "Federal income tax
credits for college expenses and
donations are the most effective
way by which the national
government can aid higher
education."
"In fact," stated Freeman,
"they are the only methods by
which the federal goverment can
assist with the most crucial
problem in college finance: how
to supply the institutions with
funds to hire not only more
teachers but to attract to the
academic profession the nation's
most talentedmen and women."
Freeman was widely
recognized at the time as one of
the principal proponents of the
tax credit plan, which had been
