# The
						Coffeehouse Is Alive And Well

A freshly-brewed cup of
expresso isn't the only thing you
can find at the Stanford
Community Coffee House.
In addition to capuchino, wein,
baklava, fresh fruit macedonia,
hot chocolate mit schlag, and an
international assortment of
pastries, you can also find a wide
variety of entertainment, wall
displays of the work of aspiring
young artists, a groovey place to
"rap" with friends, and an
atmosphere you'll never find at
"Burger Delight—open all night."
"We want everyone at Stanford
this summer," emphasized
Richard Elmore, the coffee
house's consultant and unofficial
"watchdog," "to know that they
have a place on campus that is
delightful to be in—and where
they can also get good food and
drinks."

"We want to Decome a
common denominator, in terms of
environment," Elmore continued.
"We don't want to be dominated
by any style or look. Everyone
should feel welcome."
"It's not necessarily a place
where you can do your own thing,
but where you can come and
enjoy our thing."
Plans for expanding the coffee
house's "thing" include having
displays of relics out of Stanford's
past such as old flags, furniture,
and photographs. The staff also
hopes to "import" the original
booths used in the Old Union's
snack bar to give seating facilities
a more "historical" flavor.
The coffee house, in addition,
intends to mobilize its thing by
soon stocking campus catering
trucks with coffee house food.
