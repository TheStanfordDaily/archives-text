# The 						Coffeehouse Is Alive And Well
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
A freshly-brewed cup of
expresso isn't the only thing you
can find at the Stanford
Community Coffee House.
In addition to capuchino, wein,
baklava, fresh fruit macedonia,
hot chocolate mit schlag, and an
international assortment of
pastries, you can also find a wide
variety of entertainment, wall
displays of the work of aspiring
young artists, a groovey place to
"rap" with friends, and an
atmosphere you'll never find at
"Burger Delight—open all night."
"We want everyone at Stanford
this summer," emphasized
Richard Elmore, the coffee
house's consultant and unofficial
"watchdog," "to know that they
have a place on campus that is
delightful to be in—and where
they can also get good food and
drinks."

"We want to Decome a
common denominator, in terms of
environment," Elmore continued.
"We don't want to be dominated
by any style or look. Everyone
should feel welcome."
"It's not necessarily a place
where you can do your own thing,
but where you can come and
enjoy our thing."
Plans for expanding the coffee
house's "thing" include having
displays of relics out of Stanford's
past such as old flags, furniture,
and photographs. The staff also
hopes to "import" the original
booths used in the Old Union's
snack bar to give seating facilities
a more "historical" flavor.
The coffee house, in addition,
intends to mobilize its thing by
soon stocking campus catering
trucks with coffee house food.

Wide Selection
"We're proud of the unusual
variety of foods we offer out
patrons," Elmore stated. "We're
one of the few places in the area
where you can get so many
European blends of coffee and
such an assortment of
international pastries."
"We're open a lot of hours," he
continued, and pointed out that
"The coffee house can become a
way of life."
Starting this week, the coffee
house will be serving a continental
breakfast on weekday mornings
from 9 to 11. Exotic pastries and
fresh fruit are included on the
menu.
Fulfilling Need
The coffee house, according to
many of its patrons, is fulfilling a
need that exists on campus for
many years prior to its
opening—the need for simply a
nice place to go and meet people.
"It's a great place to pick up
girls," remarked one medical
student.
Then he added, "with
honorable intentions, of course."
And similarly, you can often
overhear a co-ed suggest to a
friend, "Let's go to the coffee
house and meet some guys."
"I've met a lot of students at
the coffee house from other
campuses," another patron noted.
"The closest place you can find
a coffee house of our type,"
Elmore explained, ''is
Burlingame."
"Our office house is also a
place where a group can hold a
seminar, discuss politics, and even
study," he added, "as long as we
supply the food.
"And occasionally you can
even come in and hear Davie
Napier playing the piano. He has a
standing invitation to drop in and
perform here."
Problems Exist
The coffee house staff has
unfortunately run into a number

of problems in its nine-month
existence.
"One of the major problems
we face," Elmore began, "is that
we are being taken over by
teeny-boppers." He noted that a
lot of youngsters from the
neighboring communities
"overcrowd the place but don't
buy anything."
"I want to say frankly that we
don't want teeny-boppers," he
emphasized, "and the people who
want a semi-adult atmosphere
don't want them either."
A frequent problem of
disrespect for the premises is one
of the causes of this
over-crowding of non-customers.
"We are a make-it-or-break-it
business—a private enterprise,"
explained Elmore, "and not an
institutionalized part of the
University.
"But a lot of people think that
we're a campus institution or an
extension of Tresidder-we're
not."
"It seems, therefore, that since
people respond differently to an
institution that they do to a
business, they often don't give us
the proper respect."
He pointed out with a deal of
concern the large number of mugs
and glassware that have been
stolen. Elmore also related a story
of how one customer refused to
give an employee some empty
glasses so they could be washed,
saying, "Leave them here, I'm
going to take them home."
"One doesn't usually act that
way in a restaurant downtown,"
Elmore remarked.
Table Service
One new policy that will soon
be in full swing at the coffee
house is evening table service.
According to Elmore, "This will
help discourage the people who
aren't paying customers, as well as
provide a better atmosphere."
Plans also include having a
delicatessen counter and increased
counter space for service.

"We don't want to be dominated
by any style or look. Everyone
should feel welcome."
"It's not necessarily a place
where you can do your own thing,
but where you can come and
enjoy our thing."
Plans for expanding the coffee
house's "thing" include having
displays of relics out of Stanford's
past such as old flags, furniture,
and photographs. The staff also
hopes to "import" the original
booths used in the Old Union's
snack bar to give seating facilities
a more "historical" flavor.
The coffee house, in addition,
intends to mobilize its thing by
soon stocking campus catering
trucks with coffee house food.
Wide Selection
"We're proud of the unusual
variety of foods we offer out
patrons," Elmore stated. "We're
one of the few places in the area
where you can get so many
European blends of coffee and
such an assortment of
international pastries."
"We're open a lot of hours," he
continued, and pointed out that
"The coffee house can become a
way of life."
Starting this week, the coffee
house will be serving a continental
breakfast on weekday mornings
from 9 to 11. Exotic pastries and
fresh fruit are included on the
menu.
Fulfilling Need
The coffee house, according to
many of its patrons, is fulfilling a
need that exists on campus for
many years prior to its
opening—the need for simply a
nice place to go and meet people.
"It's a great place to pick up
girls," remarked one medical
student.
Then he added, "with
honorable intentions, of course."
And similarly, you can often
overhear a co-ed suggest to a
friend, "Let's go to the coffee
house and meet some guys."
"I've met a lot of students at
the coffee house from other
campuses," another patron noted.
"The closest place you can find
a coffee house of our type,"
Elmore explained, ''is
Burlingame."
"Our office house is also a
place where a group can hold a
seminar, discuss politics, and even
study," he added, "as long as we
supply the food.
"And occasionally you can
even come in and hear Davie
Napier playing the piano. He has a
standing invitation to drop in and
perform here."
Problems Exist
The coffee house staff has
unfortunately run into a number

of problems in its nine-month
existence.
"One of the major problems
we face," Elmore began, "is that
we are being taken over by
teeny-boppers." He noted that a
lot of youngsters from the
neighboring communities
"overcrowd the place but don't
buy anything."
"I want to say frankly that we
don't want teeny-boppers," he
emphasized, "and the people who
want a semi-adult atmosphere
don't want them either."
A frequent problem of
disrespect for the premises is one
of the causes of this
over-crowding of non-customers.
"We are a make-it-or-break-it
business—a private enterprise,"
explained Elmore, "and not an
institutionalized part of the
University.
"But a lot of people think that
we're a campus institution or an
extension of Tresidder-we're
not."
"It seems, therefore, that since
people respond differently to an
institution that they do to a
business, they often don't give us
the proper respect."
He pointed out with a deal of
concern the large number of mugs
and glassware that have been
stolen. Elmore also related a story
of how one customer refused to
give an employee some empty
glasses so they could be washed,
saying, "Leave them here, I'm
going to take them home."
"One doesn't usually act that
way in a restaurant downtown,"
Elmore remarked.
Table Service
One new policy that will soon
be in full swing at the coffee
house is evening table service.
According to Elmore, "This will
help discourage the people who
aren't paying customers, as well as
provide a better atmosphere."
Plans also include having a
delicatessen counter and increased
counter space for service.
A freshly-brewed cup of
expresso isn't the only thing you
can find at the Stanford
Community Coffee House.
In addition to capuchino, wein,
baklava, fresh fruit macedonia,
hot chocolate mit schlag, and an
international assortment of
pastries, you can also find a wide
variety of entertainment, wall
displays of the work of aspiring
young artists, a groovey place to
"rap" with friends, and an
atmosphere you'll never find at
"Burger Delight—open all night."
"We want everyone at Stanford
this summer," emphasized
Richard Elmore, the coffee
house's consultant and unofficial
"watchdog," "to know that they
have a place on campus that is
delightful to be in—and where
they can also get good food and
drinks."

"We want to Decome a
common denominator, in terms of
environment," Elmore continued.
"We don't want to be dominated
by any style or look. Everyone
should feel welcome."

"We're open a lot of hours," he
continued, and pointed out that
"The coffee house can become a
way of life."
Starting this week, the coffee
house will be serving a continental
breakfast on weekday mornings
from 9 to 11. Exotic pastries and
fresh fruit are included on the
menu.
Fulfilling Need
The coffee house, according to
many of its patrons, is fulfilling a
need that exists on campus for
many years prior to its
opening—the need for simply a
nice place to go and meet people.
"It's a great place to pick up
girls," remarked one medical
student.
Then he added, "with
honorable intentions, of course."
And similarly, you can often
overhear a co-ed suggest to a
friend, "Let's go to the coffee
house and meet some guys."
"I've met a lot of students at
the coffee house from other
campuses," another patron noted.
"The closest place you can find
a coffee house of our type,"
Elmore explained, ''is
Burlingame."
"Our office house is also a
place where a group can hold a
seminar, discuss politics, and even
study," he added, "as long as we
supply the food.
"And occasionally you can
even come in and hear Davie
Napier playing the piano. He has a
standing invitation to drop in and
perform here."
Problems Exist
The coffee house staff has
unfortunately run into a number

of problems in its nine-month
existence.
"One of the major problems
we face," Elmore began, "is that
we are being taken over by
teeny-boppers." He noted that a
lot of youngsters from the
neighboring communities
"overcrowd the place but don't
buy anything."
"I want to say frankly that we
don't want teeny-boppers," he
emphasized, "and the people who
want a semi-adult atmosphere
don't want them either."
A frequent problem of
disrespect for the premises is one
of the causes of this
over-crowding of non-customers.
"We are a make-it-or-break-it
business—a private enterprise,"
explained Elmore, "and not an
institutionalized part of the
University.
"But a lot of people think that
we're a campus institution or an
extension of Tresidder-we're
not."
"It seems, therefore, that since
people respond differently to an
institution that they do to a
business, they often don't give us
the proper respect."
He pointed out with a deal of
concern the large number of mugs
and glassware that have been
stolen. Elmore also related a story
of how one customer refused to
give an employee some empty
glasses so they could be washed,
saying, "Leave them here, I'm
going to take them home."
"One doesn't usually act that
way in a restaurant downtown,"
Elmore remarked.
Table Service
One new policy that will soon
be in full swing at the coffee
house is evening table service.
According to Elmore, "This will
help discourage the people who
aren't paying customers, as well as
provide a better atmosphere."
Plans also include having a
delicatessen counter and increased
counter space for service.
A freshly-brewed cup of
expresso isn't the only thing you
can find at the Stanford
Community Coffee House.
In addition to capuchino, wein,
baklava, fresh fruit macedonia,
hot chocolate mit schlag, and an
international assortment of
pastries, you can also find a wide
variety of entertainment, wall
displays of the work of aspiring
young artists, a groovey place to
"rap" with friends, and an
atmosphere you'll never find at
"Burger Delight—open all night."
"We want everyone at Stanford
this summer," emphasized
Richard Elmore, the coffee
house's consultant and unofficial
"watchdog," "to know that they
have a place on campus that is
delightful to be in—and where
they can also get good food and
drinks."

"We want to Decome a
common denominator, in terms of
environment," Elmore continued.
"We don't want to be dominated
by any style or look. Everyone
should feel welcome."
"It's not necessarily a place
where you can do your own thing,
but where you can come and
enjoy our thing."
Plans for expanding the coffee
house's "thing" include having
displays of relics out of Stanford's
past such as old flags, furniture,
and photographs. The staff also
hopes to "import" the original
booths used in the Old Union's
snack bar to give seating facilities
a more "historical" flavor.
The coffee house, in addition,
intends to mobilize its thing by
soon stocking campus catering
trucks with coffee house food.
Wide Selection
"We're proud of the unusual
variety of foods we offer out
patrons," Elmore stated. "We're
one of the few places in the area
where you can get so many
European blends of coffee and
such an assortment of
international pastries."
"We're open a lot of hours," he
continued, and pointed out that
