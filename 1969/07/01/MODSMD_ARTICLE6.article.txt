# Drama Opens Tonight
## 'Young, Gifted, And Black' 
### STEVE UNGAR 
Lorraine Hansberry believed
every human being is a creature of
stature, whoever or whatever he
is. She had special faith in the
black young, particularly three
prize-winners in a United Negro
College Fund essay contest that
she helped to judge. At the awards
ceremony she told them:
"Though it must be a thrilling and
marvelous thing to be merely
young and gifted in such times, it
is doubly so—double dynamic—to
be young, gifted, and black."
Sunday marked the 204 th
performance of "To Be Young,
Gifted, and Black" at New York's
Cherry Lane Theater. The
off-Broadway comedy drama hit
has been acclaimed by critics as a
unique voice of compassion,
understanding and hope for both
black and white.
The 1969 Stanford Summer
Festival will present this warm
and appealing drama at 8 p.m.
tonight through Sunday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, and at
2:30 p.m. matinees July 5 and 6.
The complete New York cast will
appear in the Stanford
production.
Directed by Gene Frankel, the
cast includes: Alice Borden,
Bernard Ward, Gertrude Jeanette,
Janet League, Tina Sattin,
Stephen Strimplell, William
Suplee and Dolores Sutton. Each
member of the company, black
and white, personifies Miss
Hansberry and her characters
during the play.
Communicate Society's Ills
Through her plays, novels,
short stories, poems and speeches,
Lorraine Hansberry set out
dramatically to communicate
society's ills to her fellow men.
With the production of her first
play, "A Raisin in the Sun," she
became, at 29, the youngest
American playwright, the fifth
woman, and the only Negro ever
to win the New York Drama

Critics Circle Award for Best Play
of the Year.
"To Be Young, Gifted and
Black" is a compendium of the
young writer's creativity, slightly
biographical but more attitudinal
as it delves into the necessity to
love rather than merely coexist
with our fellow men. It has been
adapted for the stage by her
husband, Robert Nemiroff.
At its New York opening
earlier this year, critics wrote of
the humor and optimism which
sweeps the stage, of the range and
intensity of emotions, and of the
exuberant theatricality of the
work.
Concern for New World
Beyond her compassionate
view of mankind, Miss
Hansberry's prime concern was
for a new world for herself and
her brothers. Writing to a young
boy on the subject of Martin
Luther King and the non-violent
movement she said: "I think that

Negroes must concern themselves
with every single means of
struggle: legal, illegal, passive,
active, violent and non-violent.
The acceptance of our present
condition is the only form of
extremism which discredits us
before our children."
In "To Be Young, Gifted and
Black" she has an African
pointedly remark: "I do not hate
all white men .. . among other
things, I have seen the slums of
Liverpool and Dublin and the
caves above Naples; I have seen
Dachau, and Anne Frank's attic in
Amsterdam, and too many
raw-knuckled Frenchmen coming
out of the Metro at dawn to
believe that those who raided
Africa for three centuries ever
loved the white race either."
In 1965, at the age of 34,
Lorraine Hansberry died of cancer
while her second play, "The Sign
in Sidney Brustein's Window,"
was running on Broadwav.

Sunday marked the 204 th
performance of "To Be Young,
Gifted, and Black" at New York's
Cherry Lane Theater. The
off-Broadway comedy drama hit
has been acclaimed by critics as a
unique voice of compassion,
understanding and hope for both
black and white.
The 1969 Stanford Summer
Festival will present this warm
and appealing drama at 8 p.m.
tonight through Sunday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, and at
2:30 p.m. matinees July 5 and 6.
The complete New York cast will
appear in the Stanford
production.
Directed by Gene Frankel, the
cast includes: Alice Borden,
Bernard Ward, Gertrude Jeanette,
Janet League, Tina Sattin,
Stephen Strimplell, William
Suplee and Dolores Sutton. Each
member of the company, black
and white, personifies Miss
Hansberry and her characters
during the play.
Communicate Society's Ills
Through her plays, novels,
short stories, poems and speeches,
Lorraine Hansberry set out
dramatically to communicate
society's ills to her fellow men.
With the production of her first
play, "A Raisin in the Sun," she
became, at 29, the youngest
American playwright, the fifth
woman, and the only Negro ever
to win the New York Drama

Critics Circle Award for Best Play
of the Year.
"To Be Young, Gifted and
Black" is a compendium of the
young writer's creativity, slightly
biographical but more attitudinal
as it delves into the necessity to
love rather than merely coexist
with our fellow men. It has been
adapted for the stage by her
husband, Robert Nemiroff.
At its New York opening
earlier this year, critics wrote of
the humor and optimism which
sweeps the stage, of the range and
intensity of emotions, and of the
exuberant theatricality of the
work.
Concern for New World
Beyond her compassionate
view of mankind, Miss
Hansberry's prime concern was
for a new world for herself and
her brothers. Writing to a young
boy on the subject of Martin
Luther King and the non-violent
movement she said: "I think that

Negroes must concern themselves
with every single means of
struggle: legal, illegal, passive,
active, violent and non-violent.
The acceptance of our present
condition is the only form of
extremism which discredits us
before our children."
In "To Be Young, Gifted and
Black" she has an African
pointedly remark: "I do not hate
all white men .. . among other
things, I have seen the slums of
Liverpool and Dublin and the
caves above Naples; I have seen
Dachau, and Anne Frank's attic in
Amsterdam, and too many
raw-knuckled Frenchmen coming
out of the Metro at dawn to
believe that those who raided
Africa for three centuries ever
loved the white race either."
In 1965, at the age of 34,
Lorraine Hansberry died of cancer
while her second play, "The Sign
in Sidney Brustein's Window,"
was running on Broadwav.

Lorraine Hansberry believed
every human being is a creature of

is. She had special faith in the
black young, particularly three
prize-winners in a United Negro
