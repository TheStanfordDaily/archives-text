What is it that makes it possible for otherwise liberal professors at
Stanford and elsewhere to mentally reconcile their liberal beliefs with
supporting the suppression of student rebels?
How is it that such men become secret, if not open admirers of law
and order and S.I. Hayakawa (who incidentally considers himself a
liberal Democrat)?
Perhaps the outlines of an adequate explanation can be sketched. It
has been contended by some that the anti-communism of Senator Joe
McCarthy, who was considered a liberal Republican on social welfare
issues, was not qualitatively different from the anti-communism of the
liberal Americans for Democratic Action, and that although the ADA
could condemn the excesses of McCarthyism, the ADA itself was an
intellectual prop of anti-communism as a national ideology.
In a like manner many academicians deplore the excesses of cops on
campus or of Reagan's armies in the streets of Berkeley, but would have
accepted a more carefully moderated use of force which achieved the
same ends which Reagan, for example, sought in Berkeley.
Who have been the major liberal writers who have opposed the New
Left's theory and practice? Daniel Bell, Seymour Martin Lipset, Irving
Howe, Sidney Hook, and Louis Feuer. In issue after issue of
Commentary, we hear from the likes of Diana Trilling and Theodore
Draper as part of that magazine's continuing verbal onslaught aimed
against student revolt.
These are the writers who, whether they intend to or not, provide
the apologia for liberal cooperation with Nixon's repression. These are
the writers who provide the intellectual underpinnings for
rationalizations which allow liberal to collaborate with a burgeoning
police state.
Something else about these writers: They are social-democratic
conservatives. They call themselves radicals, but for them, radicalism
consists of saying that the poor should have a larger share of the
Federal budget.
Social-democratic conservatives were advisers to the architects of
America's welfare state. These men practice a form of idolatry toward
the governmental apparatus. They see it as the only possible engine of
social progress, and therefore something to be defended at all costs.
Founded in such a logic, such a rationale, the so-called liberals are
able to stomach such governmental repression as the McClellan
Committee subpoenas, the hearings on SDS currently (an interminably)
being held by that noble successor to HUAC—the House Internal
Securities Committee—and the bill submitted by Rep. Edith Green,
foisting federal control on the university in its internal affairs.
Following such processes of reasoning, Stanford administrators
propose, Trustees applaud, and faculty accept the policy of fighting
radical activism with suspensions and probations, and the idea—just
recently suggested by the SJC—of a University subpoena power with
mandatory suspensions for non-cooperators.
Accepting the dictates of government is understandable, considering
the present state of the American university. The mellifluous voice of
the Right, William F. Buckley Jr. bids us recall "the reiterated warnings
of yesterday's conservatives, that federal money would mean federal
control." And the present situation proves the warnings to be true.
But this does not excuse the University's adopting the government's
own backlash approach in dealing with students. Their goal seems to be
peace and quiet—not peace and freedom.
