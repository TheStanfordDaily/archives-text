# Marc Weiss vs. John Gardner
## The 						Great Debate 
### 
(Editor's Note: What follows is a conversation between
Stanford Trustee John Gardner and SDS member Marc
Weiss that took place in front of President Kenneth Pitzer's
office on the afternoon of April 28. The text given here was
written down by Mr. Weiss and submitted to THE DAILY.)
Marc Weiss: I'd like to talk to you about your trip
here to Stanford.
John Gardner: Yes, I'm here on an important
mission. I was assigned to looking after the question
of restructuring the Board of Trustees.
Weiss: I don't think that's so important, since
neither you nor any other Trustee believes in real
democracy. You believe that the "responsible" elite
should have power to make decisions for the whole
community; the Board of Trustees, a body of which
you are a member, takes upon itself to make
decisions for the entire Stanford University
community.
Gardner: I'm not saying the present Board is
perfect. We may broaden the decision-making
process.
Weiss: Yes, but it still is you who are deciding
whether or not to broaden "the decision-making
process" and not the community.
Gardner: You would rather have it so that you
could manipulate the masses by clever
speech-making; that is the alternative.
Weiss If anyone is manipulative of the "masses," it
is you in your present position of power. As
President of the Carnegie Foundation and as
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, you
handled most of the funds that go for education and
public media—setting those guidelines and shaping
all our minds in the ways you like. You are the
biggest manipulator I know!
Gardner: I don't know about that.
Weiss: Well, maybe I'm praising you too highly.
There are bigger manipulators . . .
Mexican-American Student (breaking into the
conversation): Mr. Gardner, we need a
Mexican-American on the Board.
Gardner: I agree.
Weiss: What will that do?
Mexican-American Student: The Trustees need to
have information about the Mexican-American
communities and students' needs so they can make
decisions on these matters.
Weiss: But just having more information doesn't
mean they'll make any better decisions if their
interests aren't compatible. The Mexican-American
communities and students should be deciding for
themselves on the basis of their needs, not the
Trustees deciding for them using very different
criteria.
Mexican-American Student: The Mexican-American
community isn't qualified to decide for itself.
Gardner: I agree. (To Weiss) What is your solution?
(Mexican-American student leaves.)
Weiss: I don't think we need a Board of Trustees at
all.
Gardner: Do you think you could raise money as
the present Trustees can?
Weiss: The reason the Trustees have to raise the
kind of money in the way they do is because they

also determine what it will be used for. If the
community was determining the priorities, it
wouldn't need to raise five million dollars for a new
Space Sciences Building because it wouldn't have
one or need one. It wouldn't need to raise money
for Rambo's salary at AEL because he wouldn't
have a job here.
Gardner: You don't understand anything about
University financing. If we don't get $300 million in
the next twenty years, Stanford isn't going to
remain a great university.
Weiss: Stanford is not a great university; it is a
shitty university. Any university that is run by the
kind of men and system represented by you, which
makes the kind of inhumane uses of its resources
that this University presently is doing, cannot be
called great. Maybe it is great in terms of its size and
amount of resources, but nothing more.
Gardner: That's how I meant it. Do you think you
could have the kind of first-rate faculty here in
engineering or philosophy or even art without
paying the high salaries we pay.
Weiss: The only reason the faculty is "first-rate" is
because of the high salaries they are paid. You, who
pay them, define them as first-rate and therefore
pay a high price. If the community could decide,
they would judge the faculty on much different
grounds, more relevant to their needs, and most of
the present faculty here would probably be defined
as fifth-rate and would not be paid a dime. The
good people we would want wouldn't need high
salaries.
Gardner: You're so idealistic. Look at the free
universities in this country. I've studied them, and
they've all failed because they couldn't get good
professors or adequate facilities.
Weiss: That's your fault, not theirs. Because as 1"
of Carnegie Foundation you should have given 1
educational grants. I would assert the reason you
didn't is in the larger context the way in which you
manipulate and control education in this country.
You only pay for what is in your ideological
interests to do so, and the people who want money
know this and therefore must conform or die.
Gardner: We do discriminate in what we pay for
and that is why Stanford, a high-quality professional
institution, is funded, and the Free University is
not.
Weiss: I guess it just gets down to the basic question
of who in the society has the money to pay and
what they will pay for. If there is a concentration of
wealth and power, those who are wealthy have an
interest in maintaining themselves, and this is
antagonistic to the interests of the people as a
whole. This power elite is not legitimate, You have
no right to be my Trustee.
Gardner: Look, you're wasting a lot of my time.
Weiss: Once again you're showing your elitist
values. According to your hierarchical views, you
may be a lot more important than I am, but as far as
I am concerned, you've been wasting too much of
my time!
Gardner: (Angrily) Oh, come on now! That's
enough of this. (Gardner leaves.)

University financing. If we don't get $300 million in
the next twenty years, Stanford isn't going to
remain a great university.
Weiss: Stanford is not a great university; it is a
shitty university. Any university that is run by the
kind of men and system represented by you, which
makes the kind of inhumane uses of its resources
that this University presently is doing, cannot be
called great. Maybe it is great in terms of its size and
amount of resources, but nothing more.
Gardner: That's how I meant it. Do you think you
could have the kind of first-rate faculty here in
engineering or philosophy or even art without
paying the high salaries we pay.
Weiss: The only reason the faculty is "first-rate" is
because of the high salaries they are paid. You, who
pay them, define them as first-rate and therefore
pay a high price. If the community could decide,
they would judge the faculty on much different
grounds, more relevant to their needs, and most of
the present faculty here would probably be defined
as fifth-rate and would not be paid a dime. The
good people we would want wouldn't need high
salaries.
Gardner: You're so idealistic. Look at the free
universities in this country. I've studied them, and
they've all failed because they couldn't get good
professors or adequate facilities.
Weiss: That's your fault, not theirs. Because as 1"
of Carnegie Foundation you should have given 1
educational grants. I would assert the reason you
didn't is in the larger context the way in which you
manipulate and control education in this country.
You only pay for what is in your ideological
interests to do so, and the people who want money
know this and therefore must conform or die.
Gardner: We do discriminate in what we pay for
and that is why Stanford, a high-quality professional
institution, is funded, and the Free University is
not.
Weiss: I guess it just gets down to the basic question
of who in the society has the money to pay and
what they will pay for. If there is a concentration of
wealth and power, those who are wealthy have an
interest in maintaining themselves, and this is
antagonistic to the interests of the people as a
whole. This power elite is not legitimate, You have
no right to be my Trustee.
Gardner: Look, you're wasting a lot of my time.
Weiss: Once again you're showing your elitist
values. According to your hierarchical views, you
may be a lot more important than I am, but as far as
I am concerned, you've been wasting too much of
my time!
Gardner: (Angrily) Oh, come on now! That's
enough of this. (Gardner leaves.)
(Editor's Note: What follows is a conversation between
Stanford Trustee John Gardner and SDS member Marc
Weiss that took place in front of President Kenneth Pitzer's
office on the afternoon of April 28. The text given here was
written down by Mr. Weiss and submitted to THE DAILY.)
Marc Weiss: I'd like to talk to you about your trip
here to Stanford.
John Gardner: Yes, I'm here on an important
mission. I was assigned to looking after the question
of restructuring the Board of Trustees.
Weiss: I don't think that's so important, since
neither you nor any other Trustee believes in real
democracy. You believe that the "responsible" elite
should have power to make decisions for the whole
community; the Board of Trustees, a body of which
you are a member, takes upon itself to make
decisions for the entire Stanford University
community.
Gardner: I'm not saying the present Board is
perfect. We may broaden the decision-making
process.
Weiss: Yes, but it still is you who are deciding
whether or not to broaden "the decision-making
process" and not the community.
Gardner: You would rather have it so that you
could manipulate the masses by clever
speech-making; that is the alternative.
Weiss If anyone is manipulative of the "masses," it
is you in your present position of power. As
President of the Carnegie Foundation and as
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, you
handled most of the funds that go for education and
public media—setting those guidelines and shaping
all our minds in the ways you like. You are the
biggest manipulator I know!
Gardner: I don't know about that.
Weiss: Well, maybe I'm praising you too highly.
There are bigger manipulators . . .
Mexican-American Student (breaking into the
conversation): Mr. Gardner, we need a
Mexican-American on the Board.
Gardner: I agree.
Weiss: What will that do?
Mexican-American Student: The Trustees need to
have information about the Mexican-American
communities and students' needs so they can make
decisions on these matters.
Weiss: But just having more information doesn't
mean they'll make any better decisions if their
interests aren't compatible. The Mexican-American
communities and students should be deciding for
themselves on the basis of their needs, not the
Trustees deciding for them using very different
criteria.
Mexican-American Student: The Mexican-American
community isn't qualified to decide for itself.
Gardner: I agree. (To Weiss) What is your solution?
(Mexican-American student leaves.)
Weiss: I don't think we need a Board of Trustees at
all.
Gardner: Do you think you could raise money as
the present Trustees can?
Weiss: The reason the Trustees have to raise the
kind of money in the way they do is because they

also determine what it will be used for. If the
community was determining the priorities, it
wouldn't need to raise five million dollars for a new
Space Sciences Building because it wouldn't have
one or need one. It wouldn't need to raise money
for Rambo's salary at AEL because he wouldn't
have a job here.
Gardner: You don't understand anything about
University financing. If we don't get $300 million in
the next twenty years, Stanford isn't going to

Weiss: I don't think that's so important, since
neither you nor any other Trustee believes in real
democracy. You believe that the "responsible" elite
should have power to make decisions for the whole
community; the Board of Trustees, a body of which
you are a member, takes upon itself to make
decisions for the entire Stanford University
community.
Gardner: I'm not saying the present Board is
perfect. We may broaden the decision-making
process.
Weiss: Yes, but it still is you who are deciding
whether or not to broaden "the decision-making
process" and not the community.
Gardner: You would rather have it so that you
could manipulate the masses by clever
speech-making; that is the alternative.
Weiss If anyone is manipulative of the "masses," it
is you in your present position of power. As
President of the Carnegie Foundation and as
Secretary of Health, Education and Welfare, you
handled most of the funds that go for education and
public media—setting those guidelines and shaping
all our minds in the ways you like. You are the
biggest manipulator I know!
Gardner: I don't know about that.
Weiss: Well, maybe I'm praising you too highly.
There are bigger manipulators . . .
Mexican-American Student (breaking into the
conversation): Mr. Gardner, we need a
Mexican-American on the Board.
Gardner: I agree.
Weiss: What will that do?
Mexican-American Student: The Trustees need to
have information about the Mexican-American
communities and students' needs so they can make
decisions on these matters.
Weiss: But just having more information doesn't
mean they'll make any better decisions if their
interests aren't compatible. The Mexican-American
communities and students should be deciding for
themselves on the basis of their needs, not the
Trustees deciding for them using very different
criteria.
Mexican-American Student: The Mexican-American
community isn't qualified to decide for itself.
Gardner: I agree. (To Weiss) What is your solution?
(Mexican-American student leaves.)
Weiss: I don't think we need a Board of Trustees at
all.
Gardner: Do you think you could raise money as
the present Trustees can?
Weiss: The reason the Trustees have to raise the
kind of money in the way they do is because they

also determine what it will be used for. If the
community was determining the priorities, it
wouldn't need to raise five million dollars for a new
Space Sciences Building because it wouldn't have
one or need one. It wouldn't need to raise money
for Rambo's salary at AEL because he wouldn't
have a job here.
Gardner: You don't understand anything about
University financing. If we don't get $300 million in
the next twenty years, Stanford isn't going to
remain a great university.
Weiss: Stanford is not a great university; it is a
shitty university. Any university that is run by the
kind of men and system represented by you, which
makes the kind of inhumane uses of its resources
that this University presently is doing, cannot be
called great. Maybe it is great in terms of its size and
amount of resources, but nothing more.
Gardner: That's how I meant it. Do you think you
could have the kind of first-rate faculty here in
engineering or philosophy or even art without
paying the high salaries we pay.
Weiss: The only reason the faculty is "first-rate" is
because of the high salaries they are paid. You, who
pay them, define them as first-rate and therefore
pay a high price. If the community could decide,
they would judge the faculty on much different
grounds, more relevant to their needs, and most of
the present faculty here would probably be defined
as fifth-rate and would not be paid a dime. The
good people we would want wouldn't need high
salaries.
Gardner: You're so idealistic. Look at the free
universities in this country. I've studied them, and
they've all failed because they couldn't get good
professors or adequate facilities.
Weiss: That's your fault, not theirs. Because as 1"
of Carnegie Foundation you should have given 1
educational grants. I would assert the reason you
didn't is in the larger context the way in which you
manipulate and control education in this country.
You only pay for what is in your ideological
interests to do so, and the people who want money
know this and therefore must conform or die.
Gardner: We do discriminate in what we pay for
and that is why Stanford, a high-quality professional
institution, is funded, and the Free University is
not.
Weiss: I guess it just gets down to the basic question
of who in the society has the money to pay and
what they will pay for. If there is a concentration of
wealth and power, those who are wealthy have an
interest in maintaining themselves, and this is
antagonistic to the interests of the people as a
whole. This power elite is not legitimate, You have
no right to be my Trustee.
Gardner: Look, you're wasting a lot of my time.
Weiss: Once again you're showing your elitist
values. According to your hierarchical views, you
may be a lot more important than I am, but as far as
I am concerned, you've been wasting too much of
my time!
Gardner: (Angrily) Oh, come on now! That's
enough of this. (Gardner leaves.)
