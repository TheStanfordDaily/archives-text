### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ ROBERT W. BEYERS HARRY PRESS 
Top Stanford officials blasted
"anti-riot" riders aimed against
college dissidents in testimony
before the Senate's Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) President Charles
Anderson, aiso speaking before
the group headed by Arkansas
Sen. John McClellan, urged firmer
handling of student protests.
University officials who spoke
at the hearing included President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, Provost
Richard VV. Lyman, Law Professor
and Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council Jack Friedenthal,
and Associate Dean of
Engineering and Director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
William Rarnbo.
On Tuesday, Pitzer —the first of
the group from here to
test ify—declared that the
"anti-riot" amendments, such as
the conduct code suggested by
Rep. Edith Green and others, "do
more harm than good to the cause
of maintaining —or
restoring—peace on campus."
(See full text of his prepared
statement belowj

Emphasizing his "deep
concern" with disruptive acts at
Stanford and elsewhere, Pitzer
said:
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based."
Where universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption a few years
ago, now "we do see a turning
point," he added.
"As acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ide? and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community . . .
Turning Point
"One of our great concerns
now is that the turning point may
have come too late—that we may
find ourselves the victims of a
mas&ive counter-attack from an
angry American public, fed up
with catnpus antics across the
country and too impatient to bear
with lie. as we work hard to solve
these problems I'or ourselves."
Yesterday, liambo spoke
before tne group and attacked tije
anti-riot proposals, saying, "These
measures add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the university. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
university community for the
president and the administration,
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise that
authority . . .
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous."

Electronics Laboratory, which

PRESIDENT KENNETH S. PITZER
meet with sincere students" but
has made it clear that it would be
firm with those seeking to disrupt
its activities.
Paralleled Previous Speech
Anderson's comments closely
paralleled parts of a speech he
delivered to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco on June 6.
Although radical groups "have
convinced me that they will
persist perhaps for several years in
their attempts to disrupt our work
and destroy our institutions,"
Anderson said, let's not by any
means lose faith in the majority of
the university and college
students.
"We should listen to them and
try to understand them and
attempt to remedy their
legitimate complaints. In the
process, they will better
understand us.
Earlier, McClellan asked why
Pitzer simply didn't use his power
to stop disruption. Pitzer said,
"developing consensus on campus
is the way to stop it, not an order
from the president's office."
Sen. Lee Metcalf, Montana
Democrat, who delivered the
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture at
Stanford earlier this year, praised
the University for its combination
of moderation and firmness in
handling disruptions, which he
witnessed personally.
"I have never been prouder of
my association with Stanford than
at present," he said.
In response to a question from
Metcalf, Pitzer said Stanford's
research capacity had not been
impaired 'in any significant
degree" by the disruptions.
Lyman Recalled
Lyman, who originally testified
Tuesday afternoon, was recalled
yesterday. McClellan asked him
briefly about four activists—Fred
Cohen, Jack Gerson, Steve
Weissman and Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin—at the start of
Wednesday's hearing. These four
were named in a list assembled by
the committee of the top 100
SDS figures in the nation.
In response**to questions,
Lyman said Cohen had been
active on campus and had been
involved in campus disciplinary
action on at least two occasions,
following the Board of Trustees
disruption in January and the
Encina occupation May 1.
He pointed out that both
Gerson and Weissman were not
currently enrolled at the
university. Lyman said he had "no
knowledge of Prof. Franklin's
membership in any organization"
and pointed out that Franklin had
never been a defendant in campus
judicial proceedings.
At the end of Tuesday's
session, which lasted for five
hours under bright lights,
McClellan praised Stanford for its
"sincere efforts to do something
about campus disruptions," but
emphasized that Congress should
not "give taxpayers' dollars to
rabble-rousing disrupters."
No Serious Injuries
He also pointed out that no
serious injuries had resulted, and
noted that no invited guest
speakers had been prevented from
completing their talks in an
orderly manner.
Under questioning from
McClellan, Lyman pointed out
that demands posted by Students
for a Democratic Society last fall
calling for a halt to all Southeast
Asia projects had not been met.
McClellan sharply criticized
SDS for its support of the Black
Panthers, whose program he called
"completely subversive."' He
repeatedly asked why the
university kept no lists of officers
of volunteer student groups, so it
could hold them responsible for
their organizations' actions.
"We are extremely anxious to
safeguard the rights of association
on campus," Lyman replied. "The
names of officers change rather
often, and trying to keep track of
them is a rather fruitless task.
"We hold individuals
accountable for their individual
acts, regardless of their
associations, ' he said.
More Detailed System
A more detailed system of
recognition of student groups
would be a very weak weapon for

dealing with disruption, he added.
Any apparent threat to freedom
of association would cause
widespread campus reaction,
according to Lyman.
Sen. Charles Percy, Illinois
Republican and a Stanford parent,
pointed out that campus rules
about organizations at the
University of Chicago had not
stopped activity by a handful of
young communists when he was a
student there.
McClellan called the
University's action in ending the
Encina Hall occupation very
commendable," but joined other
committee members in
questioning the lack of any action
against any individuals involved in
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory occupation.
After hearing Friedenthal
describe Stanforas continuing
efforts to improve its own judicial
system. Percy said he felt
Stanford's experience in handling
disruption could prove "a great
benefit to education across the
country."
Friedenthal pointed out that
internal justice which is swift may
have a much greater impact than
outside justice which may be long
delayed. He disclosed that one
member of the Judicial Council
had been threatened with death
and another had been knocked
down, "but I don't think any of
us felt intimidated."
Several Stanford students who
attended the hearings offered
comments.
Hukari Comments
Harvey H. Hukari. Jr., editor of
The Arena, Stanford's right-wing
journal of weekly commentary,
said some of the exchange
"dramatizes the issue of federal
aid to education, which inevitably
leads to some form of control and
legislation."
Hukari is in Washington as an
intern with Human Events
Newsletter, a conservative
publication, this summer.
He had been asked, by the
committee to testify but had
declined to do so, it was reported
to the Daily by Fat Shea, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Hukari, a conservative
who strongly believes in
decentralized government, feels
that these problems—within
universities—should be solved at

the local and not national level,
Shea said.
Shea, who is participating in
the Stanford-in-Washington intern
program, commented after the
first session that "any time a
university community is
threatened, be it internal or
external, the only answer to its
continued survival in any viable
form is the coming together of its
students, faculty, and
administrative staff.
"Under the close scrutiny and
often biased opinion of many
uninformed members of the
McClellan Committee, Stanford
has survived another severe test of
maintaining its right to govern
itself internally."
Last night, he spoke further.
He sharply criticized cartoonist A 1
Capp. who testified Tuesday and
attacked dissident students,
calling them "brats."
"Neither Pitzer nor Lyman nor
later Friedenthal were there to sell
cartoons or see themselves on
TV," Shea said, "but were there
hopefully to communicate to the
General public the desire of
acuity, students, and
administration to resolve their
own problems."
Shea was highly impressed with
Lyman's testimony, although he
disagreed with several points.
Shea's view was also held by
another Stanford student—who
asked not to be identified - who
was also at the hearing.
Shea called Rambo's comments
"very tempered," but blasted
Anderson's remarks, as
half-truths. "Sitting there and
listening to that and seeing people
believe it was very frustrating."
As for the hearings as a whole,
"there was nothing to gain and all
you could do was minimize your
losses," Shea added. "Stanford
was able to do this. A situation
that was potentially dangerous to
the financial well-being of
Stanford was avoided."
The other student commented
that he was glad that Javits and
Percy were on the committee, for
their questions helped to counter
the attacks of the other senators.
'* We did as well as we
could —that is, we held our own.
But we didn't convince anybody,"
he added. "These hearings aren't
designed to convince
anyone—they are designed to
pillory the institution."

down, "but I don't think any of
us felt intimidated."
Several Stanford students who
attended the hearings offered
comments.
Hukari Comments
Harvey H. Hukari. Jr., editor of
The Arena, Stanford's right-wing
journal of weekly commentary,
said some of the exchange
"dramatizes the issue of federal
aid to education, which inevitably
leads to some form of control and
legislation."
Hukari is in Washington as an
intern with Human Events
Newsletter, a conservative
publication, this summer.
He had been asked, by the
committee to testify but had
declined to do so, it was reported
to the Daily by Fat Shea, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Hukari, a conservative
who strongly believes in
decentralized government, feels
that these problems—within
universities—should be solved at

the local and not national level,
Shea said.
Shea, who is participating in
the Stanford-in-Washington intern
program, commented after the
first session that "any time a
university community is
threatened, be it internal or
external, the only answer to its
continued survival in any viable
form is the coming together of its
students, faculty, and
administrative staff.
"Under the close scrutiny and
often biased opinion of many
uninformed members of the
McClellan Committee, Stanford
has survived another severe test of
maintaining its right to govern
itself internally."
Last night, he spoke further.
He sharply criticized cartoonist A 1
Capp. who testified Tuesday and
attacked dissident students,
calling them "brats."
"Neither Pitzer nor Lyman nor
later Friedenthal were there to sell
cartoons or see themselves on
TV," Shea said, "but were there
hopefully to communicate to the
General public the desire of
acuity, students, and
administration to resolve their
own problems."
Shea was highly impressed with
Lyman's testimony, although he
disagreed with several points.
Shea's view was also held by
another Stanford student—who
asked not to be identified - who
was also at the hearing.
Shea called Rambo's comments
"very tempered," but blasted
Anderson's remarks, as
half-truths. "Sitting there and
listening to that and seeing people
believe it was very frustrating."
As for the hearings as a whole,
"there was nothing to gain and all
you could do was minimize your
losses," Shea added. "Stanford
was able to do this. A situation
that was potentially dangerous to
the financial well-being of
Stanford was avoided."
The other student commented
that he was glad that Javits and
Percy were on the committee, for
their questions helped to counter
the attacks of the other senators.
'* We did as well as we
could —that is, we held our own.
But we didn't convince anybody,"
he added. "These hearings aren't
designed to convince
anyone—they are designed to
pillory the institution."
Top Stanford officials blasted
"anti-riot" riders aimed against
college dissidents in testimony
before the Senate's Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) President Charles
Anderson, aiso speaking before
the group headed by Arkansas
Sen. John McClellan, urged firmer
handling of student protests.
University officials who spoke
at the hearing included President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, Provost
Richard VV. Lyman, Law Professor
and Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council Jack Friedenthal,
and Associate Dean of
Engineering and Director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
William Rarnbo.
On Tuesday, Pitzer —the first of
the group from here to
test ify—declared that the
"anti-riot" amendments, such as
the conduct code suggested by
Rep. Edith Green and others, "do
more harm than good to the cause
of maintaining —or
restoring—peace on campus."
(See full text of his prepared
statement belowj

Emphasizing his "deep
concern" with disruptive acts at
Stanford and elsewhere, Pitzer
said:
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based."
Where universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption a few years
ago, now "we do see a turning
point," he added.
"As acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ide? and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community . . .
Turning Point
"One of our great concerns
now is that the turning point may
have come too late—that we may
find ourselves the victims of a
mas&ive counter-attack from an
angry American public, fed up
with catnpus antics across the
country and too impatient to bear
with lie. as we work hard to solve
these problems I'or ourselves."
Yesterday, liambo spoke
before tne group and attacked tije
anti-riot proposals, saying, "These
measures add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the university. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
university community for the
president and the administration,
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise that
authority . . .
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous."
Rambo supervises the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, which
was forced to halt operations
during a student occupation April
9-18. He also serves on the faculty
consultative group on disruptions.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
Evident in Attitudes
"That it is surely building (at
Stanford) is evident in tne
attitudes of the students as a
whole, the faculty as a whole, and
the administration.
The last of the group from here
to speak was Sill's Anderson,
whose outlook was at opposite
Eoles from the opinions expressed
y University officials.
Disruptions at SKI
SRI was subjected to a series of
disruptions by the April Third
Movement during May. The target
of the protests was war-related
research being conducted at SRI.
Anderson, in his testimony,
claimed that SRI had been
successful in opposing campus
radicals, and declared this was
because SRI had made it clear
that it would not tolerate
disruption of its operation.
(Tne damage caused at SRl's
Hanover St. facility on May 15
has not yet been repaired,
however.)
Anderson told the group that
throughout the protests SRI has
remained "willing and eager to

PRESIDENT KENNETH S. PITZER
meet with sincere students" but
has made it clear that it would be
firm with those seeking to disrupt
its activities.
Paralleled Previous Speech
Anderson's comments closely
paralleled parts of a speech he
delivered to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco on June 6.
Although radical groups "have
convinced me that they will
persist perhaps for several years in
their attempts to disrupt our work
and destroy our institutions,"
Anderson said, let's not by any
means lose faith in the majority of
the university and college
students.
"We should listen to them and
try to understand them and
attempt to remedy their
legitimate complaints. In the
process, they will better
understand us.
Earlier, McClellan asked why
Pitzer simply didn't use his power
to stop disruption. Pitzer said,
"developing consensus on campus
is the way to stop it, not an order
from the president's office."
Sen. Lee Metcalf, Montana
Democrat, who delivered the
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture at
Stanford earlier this year, praised
the University for its combination
of moderation and firmness in
handling disruptions, which he
witnessed personally.
"I have never been prouder of
my association with Stanford than
at present," he said.
In response to a question from
Metcalf, Pitzer said Stanford's
research capacity had not been
impaired 'in any significant
degree" by the disruptions.
Lyman Recalled
Lyman, who originally testified
Tuesday afternoon, was recalled
yesterday. McClellan asked him
briefly about four activists—Fred
Cohen, Jack Gerson, Steve
Weissman and Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin—at the start of
Wednesday's hearing. These four
were named in a list assembled by
the committee of the top 100
SDS figures in the nation.
In response**to questions,
Lyman said Cohen had been
active on campus and had been
involved in campus disciplinary
action on at least two occasions,
following the Board of Trustees
disruption in January and the
Encina occupation May 1.
He pointed out that both
Gerson and Weissman were not
currently enrolled at the
university. Lyman said he had "no
knowledge of Prof. Franklin's
membership in any organization"
and pointed out that Franklin had
never been a defendant in campus
judicial proceedings.
At the end of Tuesday's
session, which lasted for five
hours under bright lights,
McClellan praised Stanford for its
"sincere efforts to do something
about campus disruptions," but
emphasized that Congress should
not "give taxpayers' dollars to
rabble-rousing disrupters."
No Serious Injuries
He also pointed out that no
serious injuries had resulted, and
noted that no invited guest
speakers had been prevented from
completing their talks in an
orderly manner.
Under questioning from
McClellan, Lyman pointed out
that demands posted by Students
for a Democratic Society last fall
calling for a halt to all Southeast
Asia projects had not been met.
McClellan sharply criticized
SDS for its support of the Black
Panthers, whose program he called
"completely subversive."' He
repeatedly asked why the
university kept no lists of officers
of volunteer student groups, so it
could hold them responsible for
their organizations' actions.
"We are extremely anxious to
safeguard the rights of association
on campus," Lyman replied. "The
names of officers change rather
often, and trying to keep track of
them is a rather fruitless task.
"We hold individuals
accountable for their individual
acts, regardless of their
associations, ' he said.
More Detailed System
A more detailed system of
recognition of student groups
would be a very weak weapon for

dealing with disruption, he added.
Any apparent threat to freedom
of association would cause
widespread campus reaction,
according to Lyman.
Sen. Charles Percy, Illinois
Republican and a Stanford parent,
pointed out that campus rules
about organizations at the
University of Chicago had not
stopped activity by a handful of
young communists when he was a
student there.
McClellan called the
University's action in ending the
Encina Hall occupation very
commendable," but joined other
committee members in
questioning the lack of any action
against any individuals involved in
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory occupation.
After hearing Friedenthal
describe Stanforas continuing
efforts to improve its own judicial
system. Percy said he felt
Stanford's experience in handling
disruption could prove "a great
benefit to education across the
country."
Friedenthal pointed out that
internal justice which is swift may
have a much greater impact than
outside justice which may be long
delayed. He disclosed that one
member of the Judicial Council
had been threatened with death
and another had been knocked
down, "but I don't think any of
us felt intimidated."
Several Stanford students who
attended the hearings offered
comments.

Lyman said Cohen had been
active on campus and had been
involved in campus disciplinary
action on at least two occasions,
following the Board of Trustees
disruption in January and the
Encina occupation May 1.
He pointed out that both
Gerson and Weissman were not
currently enrolled at the
university. Lyman said he had "no
knowledge of Prof. Franklin's
membership in any organization"
and pointed out that Franklin had
never been a defendant in campus
judicial proceedings.
At the end of Tuesday's
session, which lasted for five
hours under bright lights,
McClellan praised Stanford for its
"sincere efforts to do something
about campus disruptions," but
emphasized that Congress should
not "give taxpayers' dollars to
rabble-rousing disrupters."
No Serious Injuries
He also pointed out that no
serious injuries had resulted, and
noted that no invited guest
speakers had been prevented from
completing their talks in an
orderly manner.
Under questioning from
McClellan, Lyman pointed out
that demands posted by Students
for a Democratic Society last fall
calling for a halt to all Southeast
Asia projects had not been met.
McClellan sharply criticized
SDS for its support of the Black
Panthers, whose program he called
"completely subversive."' He
repeatedly asked why the
university kept no lists of officers
of volunteer student groups, so it
could hold them responsible for
their organizations' actions.
"We are extremely anxious to
safeguard the rights of association
on campus," Lyman replied. "The
names of officers change rather
often, and trying to keep track of
them is a rather fruitless task.
"We hold individuals
accountable for their individual
acts, regardless of their
associations, ' he said.
More Detailed System
A more detailed system of
recognition of student groups
would be a very weak weapon for

dealing with disruption, he added.
Any apparent threat to freedom
of association would cause
widespread campus reaction,
according to Lyman.
Sen. Charles Percy, Illinois
Republican and a Stanford parent,
pointed out that campus rules
about organizations at the
University of Chicago had not
stopped activity by a handful of
young communists when he was a
student there.
McClellan called the
University's action in ending the
Encina Hall occupation very
commendable," but joined other
committee members in
questioning the lack of any action
against any individuals involved in
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory occupation.
After hearing Friedenthal
describe Stanforas continuing
efforts to improve its own judicial
system. Percy said he felt
Stanford's experience in handling
disruption could prove "a great
benefit to education across the
country."
Friedenthal pointed out that
internal justice which is swift may
have a much greater impact than
outside justice which may be long
delayed. He disclosed that one
member of the Judicial Council
had been threatened with death
and another had been knocked
down, "but I don't think any of
us felt intimidated."
Several Stanford students who
attended the hearings offered
comments.
Hukari Comments
Harvey H. Hukari. Jr., editor of
The Arena, Stanford's right-wing
journal of weekly commentary,
said some of the exchange
"dramatizes the issue of federal
aid to education, which inevitably
leads to some form of control and
legislation."
Hukari is in Washington as an
intern with Human Events
Newsletter, a conservative
publication, this summer.
He had been asked, by the
committee to testify but had
declined to do so, it was reported
to the Daily by Fat Shea, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Hukari, a conservative
who strongly believes in
decentralized government, feels
that these problems—within
universities—should be solved at

the local and not national level,
Shea said.
Shea, who is participating in
the Stanford-in-Washington intern
program, commented after the
first session that "any time a
university community is
threatened, be it internal or
external, the only answer to its
continued survival in any viable
form is the coming together of its
students, faculty, and
administrative staff.
"Under the close scrutiny and
often biased opinion of many
uninformed members of the
McClellan Committee, Stanford
has survived another severe test of
maintaining its right to govern
itself internally."
Last night, he spoke further.
He sharply criticized cartoonist A 1
Capp. who testified Tuesday and
attacked dissident students,
calling them "brats."
"Neither Pitzer nor Lyman nor
later Friedenthal were there to sell
cartoons or see themselves on
TV," Shea said, "but were there
hopefully to communicate to the
General public the desire of
acuity, students, and
administration to resolve their
own problems."
Shea was highly impressed with
Lyman's testimony, although he
disagreed with several points.
Shea's view was also held by
another Stanford student—who
asked not to be identified - who
was also at the hearing.
Shea called Rambo's comments
"very tempered," but blasted
Anderson's remarks, as
half-truths. "Sitting there and
listening to that and seeing people
believe it was very frustrating."
As for the hearings as a whole,
"there was nothing to gain and all
you could do was minimize your
losses," Shea added. "Stanford
was able to do this. A situation
that was potentially dangerous to
the financial well-being of
Stanford was avoided."
The other student commented
that he was glad that Javits and
Percy were on the committee, for
their questions helped to counter
the attacks of the other senators.
'* We did as well as we
could —that is, we held our own.
But we didn't convince anybody,"
he added. "These hearings aren't
designed to convince
anyone—they are designed to
pillory the institution."
Top Stanford officials blasted
"anti-riot" riders aimed against
college dissidents in testimony
before the Senate's Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) President Charles
Anderson, aiso speaking before
the group headed by Arkansas
Sen. John McClellan, urged firmer
handling of student protests.
University officials who spoke
at the hearing included President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, Provost
Richard VV. Lyman, Law Professor
and Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council Jack Friedenthal,
and Associate Dean of
Engineering and Director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
William Rarnbo.
On Tuesday, Pitzer —the first of
the group from here to
test ify—declared that the
"anti-riot" amendments, such as
the conduct code suggested by
Rep. Edith Green and others, "do
more harm than good to the cause
of maintaining —or
restoring—peace on campus."
(See full text of his prepared
statement belowj

Emphasizing his "deep
concern" with disruptive acts at
Stanford and elsewhere, Pitzer
said:
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based."
Where universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption a few years
ago, now "we do see a turning
point," he added.
"As acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ide? and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community . . .
Turning Point
"One of our great concerns
now is that the turning point may
have come too late—that we may
find ourselves the victims of a
mas&ive counter-attack from an
angry American public, fed up
with catnpus antics across the
country and too impatient to bear
with lie. as we work hard to solve
these problems I'or ourselves."
Yesterday, liambo spoke
before tne group and attacked tije
anti-riot proposals, saying, "These
measures add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the university. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
university community for the
president and the administration,
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise that
authority . . .
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous."
Rambo supervises the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, which
was forced to halt operations
during a student occupation April
9-18. He also serves on the faculty
consultative group on disruptions.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
Evident in Attitudes
"That it is surely building (at
Stanford) is evident in tne
attitudes of the students as a
whole, the faculty as a whole, and
the administration.
The last of the group from here
to speak was Sill's Anderson,
whose outlook was at opposite
Eoles from the opinions expressed
y University officials.
Disruptions at SKI
SRI was subjected to a series of
disruptions by the April Third
Movement during May. The target
of the protests was war-related
research being conducted at SRI.
Anderson, in his testimony,
claimed that SRI had been
successful in opposing campus
radicals, and declared this was
because SRI had made it clear
that it would not tolerate
disruption of its operation.
(Tne damage caused at SRl's
Hanover St. facility on May 15
has not yet been repaired,
however.)
Anderson told the group that
throughout the protests SRI has
remained "willing and eager to

meet with sincere students" but
has made it clear that it would be
firm with those seeking to disrupt
its activities.
Paralleled Previous Speech
Anderson's comments closely
paralleled parts of a speech he
delivered to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco on June 6.
Although radical groups "have
convinced me that they will
persist perhaps for several years in
their attempts to disrupt our work
and destroy our institutions,"
Anderson said, let's not by any
means lose faith in the majority of
the university and college
students.
"We should listen to them and
try to understand them and
attempt to remedy their
legitimate complaints. In the
process, they will better
understand us.
Earlier, McClellan asked why
Pitzer simply didn't use his power
to stop disruption. Pitzer said,
"developing consensus on campus
is the way to stop it, not an order
from the president's office."
Sen. Lee Metcalf, Montana
Democrat, who delivered the
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture at
Stanford earlier this year, praised
the University for its combination
of moderation and firmness in
handling disruptions, which he
witnessed personally.
"I have never been prouder of
my association with Stanford than
at present," he said.
In response to a question from
Metcalf, Pitzer said Stanford's
research capacity had not been
impaired 'in any significant
degree" by the disruptions.
Lyman Recalled
Lyman, who originally testified
Tuesday afternoon, was recalled
yesterday. McClellan asked him
briefly about four activists—Fred
Cohen, Jack Gerson, Steve
Weissman and Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin—at the start of
Wednesday's hearing. These four
were named in a list assembled by
the committee of the top 100
SDS figures in the nation.
In response**to questions,
Lyman said Cohen had been
active on campus and had been
involved in campus disciplinary
action on at least two occasions,

Disruptions at SKI

of the protests was war-related

claimed that SRI had been

that it would not tolerate

PRESIDENT KENNETH S. PITZER
meet with sincere students" but
has made it clear that it would be
firm with those seeking to disrupt
its activities.
Paralleled Previous Speech
Anderson's comments closely
paralleled parts of a speech he
delivered to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco on June 6.
Although radical groups "have
convinced me that they will
persist perhaps for several years in
their attempts to disrupt our work
and destroy our institutions,"
Anderson said, let's not by any
means lose faith in the majority of
the university and college
students.
"We should listen to them and
try to understand them and
attempt to remedy their
legitimate complaints. In the
process, they will better
understand us.
Earlier, McClellan asked why
Pitzer simply didn't use his power
to stop disruption. Pitzer said,
"developing consensus on campus
is the way to stop it, not an order
from the president's office."
Sen. Lee Metcalf, Montana
Democrat, who delivered the
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture at
Stanford earlier this year, praised
the University for its combination
of moderation and firmness in
handling disruptions, which he
witnessed personally.
"I have never been prouder of
my association with Stanford than
at present," he said.
In response to a question from
Metcalf, Pitzer said Stanford's
research capacity had not been
impaired 'in any significant
degree" by the disruptions.
Lyman Recalled
Lyman, who originally testified
Tuesday afternoon, was recalled
yesterday. McClellan asked him
briefly about four activists—Fred
Cohen, Jack Gerson, Steve
Weissman and Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin—at the start of
Wednesday's hearing. These four
were named in a list assembled by
the committee of the top 100
SDS figures in the nation.
In response**to questions,
Lyman said Cohen had been
active on campus and had been
involved in campus disciplinary
action on at least two occasions,
following the Board of Trustees
disruption in January and the
Encina occupation May 1.
He pointed out that both
Gerson and Weissman were not
currently enrolled at the
university. Lyman said he had "no
knowledge of Prof. Franklin's
membership in any organization"
and pointed out that Franklin had
never been a defendant in campus
judicial proceedings.
At the end of Tuesday's
session, which lasted for five
hours under bright lights,
McClellan praised Stanford for its
"sincere efforts to do something
about campus disruptions," but
emphasized that Congress should
not "give taxpayers' dollars to
rabble-rousing disrupters."
No Serious Injuries
He also pointed out that no
serious injuries had resulted, and
noted that no invited guest
speakers had been prevented from
completing their talks in an
orderly manner.
Under questioning from
McClellan, Lyman pointed out
that demands posted by Students
for a Democratic Society last fall
calling for a halt to all Southeast
Asia projects had not been met.
McClellan sharply criticized
SDS for its support of the Black
Panthers, whose program he called
"completely subversive."' He
repeatedly asked why the
university kept no lists of officers
of volunteer student groups, so it
could hold them responsible for
their organizations' actions.
"We are extremely anxious to
safeguard the rights of association
on campus," Lyman replied. "The
names of officers change rather
often, and trying to keep track of
them is a rather fruitless task.
"We hold individuals
accountable for their individual
acts, regardless of their
associations, ' he said.
More Detailed System
A more detailed system of
recognition of student groups
would be a very weak weapon for

dealing with disruption, he added.
Any apparent threat to freedom
of association would cause
widespread campus reaction,
according to Lyman.
Sen. Charles Percy, Illinois
Republican and a Stanford parent,
pointed out that campus rules
about organizations at the
University of Chicago had not
stopped activity by a handful of
young communists when he was a
student there.
McClellan called the
University's action in ending the
Encina Hall occupation very
commendable," but joined other
committee members in
questioning the lack of any action
against any individuals involved in
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory occupation.
After hearing Friedenthal
describe Stanforas continuing
efforts to improve its own judicial
system. Percy said he felt
Stanford's experience in handling
disruption could prove "a great
benefit to education across the
country."
Friedenthal pointed out that
internal justice which is swift may
have a much greater impact than
outside justice which may be long
delayed. He disclosed that one
member of the Judicial Council
had been threatened with death
and another had been knocked
down, "but I don't think any of
us felt intimidated."
Several Stanford students who
attended the hearings offered
comments.
Hukari Comments
Harvey H. Hukari. Jr., editor of
The Arena, Stanford's right-wing
journal of weekly commentary,
said some of the exchange
"dramatizes the issue of federal
aid to education, which inevitably
leads to some form of control and
legislation."
Hukari is in Washington as an
intern with Human Events
Newsletter, a conservative
publication, this summer.
He had been asked, by the
committee to testify but had
declined to do so, it was reported
to the Daily by Fat Shea, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Hukari, a conservative
who strongly believes in
decentralized government, feels
that these problems—within
universities—should be solved at

the local and not national level,
Shea said.
Shea, who is participating in
the Stanford-in-Washington intern
program, commented after the
first session that "any time a
university community is
threatened, be it internal or
external, the only answer to its
continued survival in any viable
form is the coming together of its
students, faculty, and
administrative staff.
"Under the close scrutiny and
often biased opinion of many
uninformed members of the
McClellan Committee, Stanford
has survived another severe test of
maintaining its right to govern
itself internally."
Last night, he spoke further.
He sharply criticized cartoonist A 1
Capp. who testified Tuesday and
attacked dissident students,
calling them "brats."
"Neither Pitzer nor Lyman nor
later Friedenthal were there to sell
cartoons or see themselves on
TV," Shea said, "but were there
hopefully to communicate to the
General public the desire of
acuity, students, and
administration to resolve their
own problems."
Shea was highly impressed with
Lyman's testimony, although he
disagreed with several points.
Shea's view was also held by
another Stanford student—who
asked not to be identified - who
was also at the hearing.
Shea called Rambo's comments
"very tempered," but blasted
Anderson's remarks, as
half-truths. "Sitting there and
listening to that and seeing people
believe it was very frustrating."
As for the hearings as a whole,
"there was nothing to gain and all
you could do was minimize your
losses," Shea added. "Stanford
was able to do this. A situation
that was potentially dangerous to
the financial well-being of
Stanford was avoided."
The other student commented
that he was glad that Javits and
Percy were on the committee, for
their questions helped to counter
the attacks of the other senators.
'* We did as well as we
could —that is, we held our own.
But we didn't convince anybody,"
he added. "These hearings aren't
designed to convince
anyone—they are designed to
pillory the institution."
Top Stanford officials blasted
"anti-riot" riders aimed against
college dissidents in testimony
before the Senate's Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) President Charles
Anderson, aiso speaking before
the group headed by Arkansas
Sen. John McClellan, urged firmer
handling of student protests.
University officials who spoke
at the hearing included President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, Provost
Richard VV. Lyman, Law Professor
and Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council Jack Friedenthal,
and Associate Dean of
Engineering and Director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
William Rarnbo.
On Tuesday, Pitzer —the first of
the group from here to
test ify—declared that the
"anti-riot" amendments, such as
the conduct code suggested by
Rep. Edith Green and others, "do
more harm than good to the cause
of maintaining —or
restoring—peace on campus."
(See full text of his prepared
statement belowj

Emphasizing his "deep
concern" with disruptive acts at
Stanford and elsewhere, Pitzer
said:
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based."
Where universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption a few years
ago, now "we do see a turning
point," he added.
"As acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ide? and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community . . .
Turning Point
"One of our great concerns
now is that the turning point may
have come too late—that we may
find ourselves the victims of a
mas&ive counter-attack from an
angry American public, fed up
with catnpus antics across the
country and too impatient to bear
with lie. as we work hard to solve
these problems I'or ourselves."
Yesterday, liambo spoke
before tne group and attacked tije
anti-riot proposals, saying, "These
measures add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the university. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
university community for the
president and the administration,
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise that
authority . . .
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous."
Rambo supervises the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, which
was forced to halt operations
during a student occupation April
9-18. He also serves on the faculty
consultative group on disruptions.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
Evident in Attitudes
"That it is surely building (at
Stanford) is evident in tne
attitudes of the students as a
whole, the faculty as a whole, and
the administration.

Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) President Charles
Anderson, aiso speaking before
the group headed by Arkansas
Sen. John McClellan, urged firmer
handling of student protests.
University officials who spoke
at the hearing included President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, Provost
Richard VV. Lyman, Law Professor
and Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council Jack Friedenthal,
and Associate Dean of
Engineering and Director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
William Rarnbo.
On Tuesday, Pitzer —the first of
the group from here to
test ify—declared that the
"anti-riot" amendments, such as
the conduct code suggested by
Rep. Edith Green and others, "do
more harm than good to the cause
of maintaining —or
restoring—peace on campus."
(See full text of his prepared
statement belowj

Emphasizing his "deep
concern" with disruptive acts at
Stanford and elsewhere, Pitzer
said:
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based."
Where universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption a few years
ago, now "we do see a turning
point," he added.
"As acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ide? and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community . . .
Turning Point
"One of our great concerns
now is that the turning point may
have come too late—that we may
find ourselves the victims of a
mas&ive counter-attack from an
angry American public, fed up
with catnpus antics across the
country and too impatient to bear
with lie. as we work hard to solve
these problems I'or ourselves."
Yesterday, liambo spoke
before tne group and attacked tije
anti-riot proposals, saying, "These
measures add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the university. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
university community for the
president and the administration,
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise that
authority . . .
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous."
Rambo supervises the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, which
was forced to halt operations
during a student occupation April
9-18. He also serves on the faculty
consultative group on disruptions.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
Evident in Attitudes
"That it is surely building (at
Stanford) is evident in tne
attitudes of the students as a
whole, the faculty as a whole, and
the administration.
The last of the group from here
to speak was Sill's Anderson,
whose outlook was at opposite
Eoles from the opinions expressed
y University officials.
Disruptions at SKI
SRI was subjected to a series of
disruptions by the April Third
Movement during May. The target
of the protests was war-related
research being conducted at SRI.
Anderson, in his testimony,
claimed that SRI had been
successful in opposing campus
radicals, and declared this was
because SRI had made it clear
that it would not tolerate
disruption of its operation.
(Tne damage caused at SRl's
Hanover St. facility on May 15
has not yet been repaired,
however.)
Anderson told the group that
throughout the protests SRI has
remained "willing and eager to

meet with sincere students" but
has made it clear that it would be
firm with those seeking to disrupt
its activities.
Paralleled Previous Speech
Anderson's comments closely
paralleled parts of a speech he
delivered to the Commonwealth
Club in San Francisco on June 6.
Although radical groups "have
convinced me that they will
persist perhaps for several years in
their attempts to disrupt our work
and destroy our institutions,"
Anderson said, let's not by any
means lose faith in the majority of
the university and college
students.
"We should listen to them and
try to understand them and
attempt to remedy their
legitimate complaints. In the
process, they will better
understand us.
Earlier, McClellan asked why
Pitzer simply didn't use his power
to stop disruption. Pitzer said,
"developing consensus on campus
is the way to stop it, not an order
from the president's office."
Sen. Lee Metcalf, Montana
Democrat, who delivered the
Distinguished Alumnus Lecture at
Stanford earlier this year, praised
the University for its combination
of moderation and firmness in
handling disruptions, which he
witnessed personally.
"I have never been prouder of
my association with Stanford than
at present," he said.
In response to a question from
Metcalf, Pitzer said Stanford's
research capacity had not been
impaired 'in any significant
degree" by the disruptions.
Lyman Recalled
Lyman, who originally testified
Tuesday afternoon, was recalled
yesterday. McClellan asked him
briefly about four activists—Fred
Cohen, Jack Gerson, Steve
Weissman and Associate Prof. H.
Bruce Franklin—at the start of
Wednesday's hearing. These four
were named in a list assembled by
the committee of the top 100
SDS figures in the nation.
In response**to questions,
Lyman said Cohen had been
active on campus and had been
involved in campus disciplinary
action on at least two occasions,
following the Board of Trustees
disruption in January and the
Encina occupation May 1.
He pointed out that both
Gerson and Weissman were not
currently enrolled at the
university. Lyman said he had "no
knowledge of Prof. Franklin's
membership in any organization"
and pointed out that Franklin had
never been a defendant in campus
judicial proceedings.
At the end of Tuesday's
session, which lasted for five
hours under bright lights,
McClellan praised Stanford for its
"sincere efforts to do something
about campus disruptions," but
emphasized that Congress should
not "give taxpayers' dollars to
rabble-rousing disrupters."
No Serious Injuries
He also pointed out that no
serious injuries had resulted, and
noted that no invited guest
speakers had been prevented from
completing their talks in an
orderly manner.
Under questioning from
McClellan, Lyman pointed out
that demands posted by Students
for a Democratic Society last fall
calling for a halt to all Southeast
Asia projects had not been met.
McClellan sharply criticized
SDS for its support of the Black
Panthers, whose program he called
"completely subversive."' He
repeatedly asked why the
university kept no lists of officers
of volunteer student groups, so it
could hold them responsible for
their organizations' actions.
"We are extremely anxious to
safeguard the rights of association
on campus," Lyman replied. "The
names of officers change rather
often, and trying to keep track of
them is a rather fruitless task.
"We hold individuals
accountable for their individual
acts, regardless of their
associations, ' he said.
More Detailed System
A more detailed system of
recognition of student groups
would be a very weak weapon for

dealing with disruption, he added.
Any apparent threat to freedom
of association would cause
widespread campus reaction,
according to Lyman.
Sen. Charles Percy, Illinois
Republican and a Stanford parent,
pointed out that campus rules
about organizations at the
University of Chicago had not
stopped activity by a handful of
young communists when he was a
student there.
McClellan called the
University's action in ending the
Encina Hall occupation very
commendable," but joined other
committee members in
questioning the lack of any action
against any individuals involved in
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory occupation.
After hearing Friedenthal
describe Stanforas continuing
efforts to improve its own judicial
system. Percy said he felt
Stanford's experience in handling
disruption could prove "a great
benefit to education across the
country."
Friedenthal pointed out that
internal justice which is swift may
have a much greater impact than
outside justice which may be long
delayed. He disclosed that one
member of the Judicial Council
had been threatened with death
and another had been knocked
down, "but I don't think any of
us felt intimidated."
Several Stanford students who
attended the hearings offered
comments.
Hukari Comments
Harvey H. Hukari. Jr., editor of
The Arena, Stanford's right-wing
journal of weekly commentary,
said some of the exchange
"dramatizes the issue of federal
aid to education, which inevitably
leads to some form of control and
legislation."
Hukari is in Washington as an
intern with Human Events
Newsletter, a conservative
publication, this summer.
He had been asked, by the
committee to testify but had
declined to do so, it was reported
to the Daily by Fat Shea, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Hukari, a conservative
who strongly believes in
decentralized government, feels
that these problems—within
universities—should be solved at

the local and not national level,
Shea said.
Shea, who is participating in
the Stanford-in-Washington intern
program, commented after the
first session that "any time a
university community is
threatened, be it internal or
external, the only answer to its
continued survival in any viable
form is the coming together of its
students, faculty, and
administrative staff.
"Under the close scrutiny and
often biased opinion of many
uninformed members of the
McClellan Committee, Stanford
has survived another severe test of
maintaining its right to govern
itself internally."
Last night, he spoke further.
He sharply criticized cartoonist A 1
Capp. who testified Tuesday and
attacked dissident students,
calling them "brats."
"Neither Pitzer nor Lyman nor
later Friedenthal were there to sell
cartoons or see themselves on
TV," Shea said, "but were there
hopefully to communicate to the
General public the desire of
acuity, students, and
administration to resolve their
own problems."
Shea was highly impressed with
Lyman's testimony, although he
disagreed with several points.
Shea's view was also held by
another Stanford student—who
asked not to be identified - who
was also at the hearing.
Shea called Rambo's comments
"very tempered," but blasted
Anderson's remarks, as
half-truths. "Sitting there and
listening to that and seeing people
believe it was very frustrating."
As for the hearings as a whole,
"there was nothing to gain and all
you could do was minimize your
losses," Shea added. "Stanford
was able to do this. A situation
that was potentially dangerous to
the financial well-being of
Stanford was avoided."
The other student commented
that he was glad that Javits and
Percy were on the committee, for
their questions helped to counter
the attacks of the other senators.
'* We did as well as we
could —that is, we held our own.
But we didn't convince anybody,"
he added. "These hearings aren't
designed to convince
anyone—they are designed to
pillory the institution."

journal of weekly commentary,
said some of the exchange
"dramatizes the issue of federal
aid to education, which inevitably
leads to some form of control and
legislation."
Hukari is in Washington as an
intern with Human Events
Newsletter, a conservative
publication, this summer.
He had been asked, by the
committee to testify but had
declined to do so, it was reported
to the Daily by Fat Shea, member
of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. Hukari, a conservative
who strongly believes in
decentralized government, feels
that these problems—within
universities—should be solved at

the local and not national level,
Shea said.
Shea, who is participating in
the Stanford-in-Washington intern
program, commented after the
first session that "any time a
university community is
threatened, be it internal or
external, the only answer to its
continued survival in any viable
form is the coming together of its
students, faculty, and
administrative staff.
"Under the close scrutiny and
often biased opinion of many
uninformed members of the
McClellan Committee, Stanford
has survived another severe test of
maintaining its right to govern
itself internally."
Last night, he spoke further.
He sharply criticized cartoonist A 1
Capp. who testified Tuesday and
attacked dissident students,
calling them "brats."
"Neither Pitzer nor Lyman nor
later Friedenthal were there to sell
cartoons or see themselves on
TV," Shea said, "but were there
hopefully to communicate to the
General public the desire of
acuity, students, and
administration to resolve their
own problems."
Shea was highly impressed with
Lyman's testimony, although he
disagreed with several points.
Shea's view was also held by
another Stanford student—who
asked not to be identified - who
was also at the hearing.
Shea called Rambo's comments
"very tempered," but blasted
Anderson's remarks, as
half-truths. "Sitting there and
listening to that and seeing people
believe it was very frustrating."
As for the hearings as a whole,
"there was nothing to gain and all
you could do was minimize your
losses," Shea added. "Stanford
was able to do this. A situation
that was potentially dangerous to
the financial well-being of
Stanford was avoided."
The other student commented
that he was glad that Javits and
Percy were on the committee, for
their questions helped to counter
the attacks of the other senators.
'* We did as well as we
could —that is, we held our own.
But we didn't convince anybody,"
he added. "These hearings aren't
designed to convince
anyone—they are designed to
pillory the institution."
