### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ ROBERT W. BEYERS HARRY PRESS 
Top Stanford officials blasted
"anti-riot" riders aimed against
college dissidents in testimony
before the Senate's Permanent
Subcommittee on Investigations
Tuesday and Wednesday.
Meanwhile, Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) President Charles
Anderson, aiso speaking before
the group headed by Arkansas
Sen. John McClellan, urged firmer
handling of student protests.
University officials who spoke
at the hearing included President
Kenneth S. Pitzer, Provost
Richard VV. Lyman, Law Professor
and Chairman of the Stanford
Judicial Council Jack Friedenthal,
and Associate Dean of
Engineering and Director of the
Stanford Electronics Laboratory
William Rarnbo.
On Tuesday, Pitzer —the first of
the group from here to
test ify—declared that the
"anti-riot" amendments, such as
the conduct code suggested by
Rep. Edith Green and others, "do
more harm than good to the cause
of maintaining —or
restoring—peace on campus."
(See full text of his prepared
statement belowj

Emphasizing his "deep
concern" with disruptive acts at
Stanford and elsewhere, Pitzer
said:
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based."
Where universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption a few years
ago, now "we do see a turning
point," he added.
"As acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ide? and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community . . .
Turning Point
"One of our great concerns
now is that the turning point may
have come too late—that we may
find ourselves the victims of a
mas&ive counter-attack from an
angry American public, fed up
with catnpus antics across the
country and too impatient to bear
with lie. as we work hard to solve
these problems I'or ourselves."
Yesterday, liambo spoke
before tne group and attacked tije
anti-riot proposals, saying, "These
measures add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the university. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
university community for the
president and the administration,
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise that
authority . . .
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous."
Rambo supervises the Applied
Electronics Laboratory, which
was forced to halt operations
during a student occupation April
9-18. He also serves on the faculty
consultative group on disruptions.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
Evident in Attitudes
"That it is surely building (at
Stanford) is evident in tne
attitudes of the students as a
whole, the faculty as a whole, and
the administration.
The last of the group from here
to speak was Sill's Anderson,
whose outlook was at opposite
Eoles from the opinions expressed
y University officials.
Disruptions at SKI
SRI was subjected to a series of
disruptions by the April Third
Movement during May. The target
of the protests was war-related
research being conducted at SRI.
Anderson, in his testimony,
claimed that SRI had been
successful in opposing campus
radicals, and declared this was
because SRI had made it clear
that it would not tolerate
disruption of its operation.
(Tne damage caused at SRl's
Hanover St. facility on May 15
has not yet been repaired,
however.)
Anderson told the group that
throughout the protests SRI has
remained "willing and eager to
