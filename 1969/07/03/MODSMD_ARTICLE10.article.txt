Economist Roger A. Freeman,
a senior staff member of the
Hoover Institution, has officially
been appointed special assistant to
President Nixon, as predicted in
Tuesday's Daily.
The announcement was made
at the White house this morning.
Freeman, 64, will work as
deputy to fellow economist
Arthur F. Burns, counselor to the
President, charged with
developing domestic programs and
policies. He will concentrate on all
aspects of the Administration's
domestic programs and policies.
He comes to this new post with
