## 'Young, Gifted, And Black' 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Lorraine Hansberry must have
been a very beautiful woman. I
have a feeling of great warmth and
friendliness both towards her,
and, strange as it seems, from her.
Why strange? One does not
normally feel 'friendliness
extended towards one by the
dead, and Miss Hansberry, most
tragically, has been dead for four
years.
But I have just seen "To Be
Young, Gifted and Black," and
Miss Hansberry speaks from this
play to the audience; what she
says is gentle, and warm, and
friendly; and often funny, and
sometimes, quite moving. "To Be
Young, Gifted and Black," which
opened Tuesday night in
Dinkelspiel Auditorium, is far
from perfect, but we can save the
rocks for later.
First I'd like to tell you why it
has left me feeling so . . .well, so
warm.
Lorraine Hansberry was a
Negro writer whose most famous
work was the play "A Raisin in
the Sun." It was voted Best Play
of the Year by the New York
Drama Critics Circle, and later
made into an excellent film
(which, if you're lucky, you can
catch on the tube). Her second
play, "The Sign in Sidney
Brustein's Window," was playing
on Broadway when she died of
cancer, at the age of 34.
Husband Compiled Letters
Her husband, the producer and
playwright Robert Nemiroff, has
compiled her letters, essays,
published and unpublished stories,
novels, and plays, and used them
to write "To Be Young, Gifted
and Black," a play about her, in
her own words.
Miss Hansberry is like a caress,
a soft smile, a gentle voice in the
midst of all the shouting. It is so,
so rare these days to hear words
about race, about black and white
Americans, that aren't strident,
stertorous, bellicose, threatening.
Miss Hansberry knew full well the
needs of her people.
She warned way back in the
pleistocene, in 1962, that the
black man was just about fed up
with what American society was
giving him. But she also
recognized the terrible, tragic
dillema that her country was in;
and her response was not
forgiving, but rather
compassionate and understanding.
I wish I could have met her.
Her death was a tragic loss for this
country.
Compilation Falls Short
Well, as for the play itself: I
only wish that Mr. Nemiroff could
compile as well as his wife could
write. The play and the
production are both good. I wish I
could say more for them that
that, for surely more was
expected. The faults are not sharp
or intense; rather, they are like
aches, that pervade the whole,
more or less homogeneously.

"TO BE YOUNG, GIFTED,
AND BLACK, the World of
Lorraine Hans berry in Her Own
Words," Adopted by Robert
Nemiroff; Produced by Burt
D'Lugoff, Ray Larson, and Robert
Nemiroff; Directed by Gene
Frankel; Presented by Arrangement
with Harry Belefonte/Chiz Schultz
and Edgar Lansbury; at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, with the following
cast: Ed Bernard, Alice Borden,
Gertrude Jeannette, Janet League,
Josephine Lemmo, Tina Sattin,
William Supplee.

The first act seems very
fragmented—the scenes don't hang
together, they don't seem to
follow from one another. Several
times I found my attention
wandering, and I kept glancing at
my watch.
The second act, thank
goodness, picked up quite a bit.
The reason, I suspect, was that it
was very heavy with material that
Miss Hansberry had actually
written for the theater, while the
first act, describing her early life,
was taken largely from
non-theatrical sources. Whatever
the explanation, the first act
seemed to drag, and the second
act soared.
Another problem was the
rather consistent inconsistencies
in the acting. The actors are not
clearly identified as individuals in
the program, so I can't single out
any one for praise or blame. They
all seemed to have problems at
some time during the olav.

This may very well have been
due to the new theater, the
sudden time change, and the fact
that the technicians didn't yet
have things down pat (the
company flew in from New York
Monday).
All these could easily throw off
an actor. In general, the
performances were good—it was
those little moments when they
slipped that was so annoying.
After all, this is a New York
company.
Finally, there was the
directing. Gene Frankel is a
director with a list of credits that
includes two Obies and the
Vernon Rice Award. You'd never
know it from this play.
I hesitate to criticize Gene
Frankel. Undoubtedly, he has
more theater knowledge in his left
pinkie than I will ever have. I'm
sorry, but I still found many parts
of the show depressingly static, and
in several sequences,
embarrassingly clicheed.
The first act closing
particularly bothered me. It is a
scene from "A Raisin in the Sun,"
the climactic scene, in which the
son finally attains the dignity for
which he has been searching. I
found the staging weak, and the
effect shallow. Everyone else
applauded, so maybe reviewers
don't know everything.
"To Be Young, Gifted and
Black" will play through Sunday
night. It is a rather unusual, but
very appropriate, way to spend
part of your 4th of July weekend.
