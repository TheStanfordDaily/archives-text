football as well as track.
Before his election to Congress
he had served the government as a
member of the President's
Committee on Physical Fitness

Kennedy, and Johnson. While in
the Marine Corps, where he served
as a captain, he was on leave for
six months to the Department of
State to promote American youth
programs internationally.
He is still interested in youth

consider the programs of the
Nixon Administration involving
youth. He is a member of the
House committee concerned with
crime in the United States, and
