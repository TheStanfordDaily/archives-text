# July 4th Be-In Set In El Camino Park
## 
### PETER M. DOLINGER 
A "Revolutionary Be-In" is
planned for July 4th at El Camino
Park, across from the Stanford
Shopping Center.
Members of the P.T.A.
(Protestors, Troublemakers, and
Anarchists), sponsors of the
afternoon-long event, say that
they have "already felt the
repression" of Palo Alto's
amplified sound ordinance passed
by the City Council last
December.
"The main problem is getting
bands," a P.T.A. organizer told
the Daily. "The bands know they
may be busted and have their
equipment impounded if they
play." So far, only one band
"willing to face a bust" has been
found.
Other bands have said they
would watch the situation and
play "if the cops are cool." Most

rock bands play at several
hundred watts.
"The (sound) ordinance is
likely to be found
unconstitutional if taken to
court,"the P.T.A. member, who
asked to remain unidentified, said.
Asked why he did not wish his
name to appear in the Daily, the
tall, bearded protestor replied,
"there's enough heat down on us
already. Letting the cops know
who's organizing the Be-In would
tempt them even more to mess up
the party."
"Everyone should bring an
instrument," he continued.
''There's no law against
unamplified music. And for those
who don't particularly care about
music, there's going to be some
dancing girls and, since it's July
4th, there may be a political
speech or two. We just want
people to get together and
celebrate Independence Day."
