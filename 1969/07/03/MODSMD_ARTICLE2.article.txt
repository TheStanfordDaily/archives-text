(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
