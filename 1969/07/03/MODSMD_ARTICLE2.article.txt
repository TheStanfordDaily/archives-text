# Pitzer's Statement To Senators

### 
(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.

imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.

(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.
(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.

to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.
(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.

government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.
(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth

goals and values—these are the

Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.
(Statement delivered by
President Pitzer to McClellan
Committee Tuesday:)
Mr. Chairman, Members of the
Committee, Ladies and
Gentlemen:
I welcome this opportunity to
discuss some aspects of the very
serious and complex problem of
campus dissruptions with you
today. This situation is relatively
new to institutions which
traditionally have sought to
resolve problems through rational
discourse and thoughtful analysis.
Understandably, it has aroused
the concern of the American
people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive

people and their representatives,
who have so long respected and
supported our system of higher
education.
At the outset, let me make
clear that we are concerned—
deeply concerned—with the
disruptive acts which have
occurred with growing frequency
on the nation's college campuses,
including Stanford. Our colleges
and universities are the keystone
of America's educational system,
which is vital to our national
development and welfare. We
must not, we dare not, let our
institutions of learning be
weakened, divided, or destroyed
by attacks, from within or from
without, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which
they are based.
My own views of how we
should approach the problem of
campus disruption closely parallel
those recently expressed by the
National Commission on the
Causes and Prevention of
Violence. In its interim report,

issued in June, the Commission
made four specific
recommendations for dealing with
student disorder.
The report expressed hope
these suggestions would
"contribute to constructive
thought and action before the
beginning of the new academic
year in September."
At Stanford, during the past
year, we already have made
substantial progress almost
exactly along the guidelines
proposed by the Commission. My
statement will summarize what we
did to prepare for disorders and
how this preparedness helped us
deal with the disruptions which
later occurred at Stanford.
The four suggestions of the
Commission, in brief, were these:
1. "A broad consensus should
be achieved among students,
faculty, and administrators
concerning the permissible
methods of presenting ideas,
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them.
2. "Universities should prepare
and currently review contingency
plans for dealing with campus
disorders. Advance plans should
be made to determine, insofar as
possible, the circumstances under
which the university will use
campus disciplinary procedures,
campus police, court injunctions,
other court sanctions, and the
civil police.
3. "Procedures for campus
governance and constructive
reform should be developed to
permit more rapid and effective
decision-making.

4. "Faculty leaders and
administrative officers need to
make greater efforts to improve
communication on campus and
with alumni and the general
public."
The first of the Commission's
recommendations may be the
most difficult to achieve. On
campus, as in the rest of society,
effective governance and
discipline depend on a reasonably
broad consensus regarding the
boundaries of acceptable conduct,
as well as appropriate means for
considering and achieving change.
On campus, perhaps even more
than elsewhere in society, it is
particularly important to maintain
an open climate for discussion,
where the most controversial ideas
can be expressed and debated.
Freedom is the essence of the
university. As all of us know, it
also is the heart of the democratic
process. Its historic importance to
the academic community
accounts for the reluctance of
many persons on campus to
impose or support harsh penalties
on those found guilty of all but
the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.

the most seriously disruptive acts.
But as acts of disruption have
grown, both in frequency and
severity, the academic community
across the country increasingly
has recognized them for what
they are—namely, a threat to free
inquiry, to the free expression of
ideas, and to the very civil
liberties long regarded as vital to
the campus community.
This educational process has
been neither quick nor cheap.
Education seldom is.

Given the natural tendencies of
individuals in and around
universities to "think otherwise"
on specific issues, we at Stanford
have achieved a remarkable degree
of unity among trustees, students,
faculty, and alumni on the need
to avoid violence in resolving
differences of opinion and on the
need for firm action when that is
required.
Overwhelming majorities of
these constituencies have made
clear their opposition to coercive
tactics in several ways: 1) through
resolutions and referenda; 2)
through comprehensive reform of
our campus judicial procedures; 3)
through tacit or explicit approval
of disciplinary steps taken within
the campus community; and 4)
through widespread support of
resort to civil authority when this
has proven necessary.
Most of this change has
occurred within the past year. A
specific contrast in instructive. In
May, 1968, a majority of the
Stanford faculty voted for
amnesty for a group of students
then occupying the Old Student
Union. A year later, the faculty
almost unanimously endorsed our
action in calling the police to end
a sit-in at one of our principal
administrative buildings, Encina
Hall. The penalties subsequently
imposed by the Stanford Judicial
Council —14 suspensions, 48
probations, and fines totalling
$3525—constituted the broadest
and most severe disciplinary
action taken on campus in several
decades.
1. Our rules on campus
disruptions were adopted after
wide consultation with the
constituencies involved. Formally
endorsed by faculty
representatives, the rules apply
equally to students, faculty, and
staff.
2. The University's new basic
framework for rule-making and
discipline —the Legislative and
Judicial Charter of 1968—was
formally endorsed by students,
faculty, and officers.
3. Individuals chosen by
students and by faculty comprise
the Stanford Judicial Council.
This group has the primary
responsibility for recommending
appropriate disciplinary sanctions,
and these have gained very broad
support from all campus
constituencies.
4. A small consultative group
of faculty members, chosen by
their colleagues, provided advice
to me throughout the year. This
included a continuing, detailed
examination of the same
enforcement alternatives outlined
by the National Commission as
well as direct, on-the-spot
evaluation of actual and
anticipated disruptions on our
campus.
5. While Stanford chose to
place primary reliance on its own
disciplinary procedures, the
University never ruled out resort
to civil authority. Our
representatives consulted with the
Santa Clara County Sheriff's
Office for nearly a year on steps
to be taken in the event outside
assistance was needed.
Arrangements were made for
faculty observers to accompany
police to witness actual events. We
felt a faculty presence could
exercise a moderating influence
on any confrontation and help
assure accurate reports of what
took place. We found the Sheriff's
office unusually cooperative and
understanding in this undertaking.
Following the police action at
Encina, and on the same day, a
restraining order was obtained
from the court. An injunction was
subsequently issued and has
proven effective.
6. The campus substantially
strengthened its own
governmental mechanisms
through the creation of a new
faculty representative body (The
Senate of the Academic Council),
the extension of student
participation to virtually all
university committees, and the
creation of new consultative
mechanisms involving students,
faculty, and trustees (the
University Advisory Committee).
7. Internal communication
was markedly improved, both
through face-to-face meetings and
through new publications.
Student government leaders, on
their own initiative, appointed an
alumni advisory group, for
example. Professors, staff
members, and key students
received a greatly expanded
weekly report on campus events
(the Campus Report) as well as
numerous overnight- releases on
spot developments through direct,
internal channels.
In addition to these official
actions, increasing numbers of
individuals have made their
oppositon to coercive tactics
clear.
More than 30 students, acting
as citizens and counter
demonstrators, took hundreds of
photographs and aided in the
identification of individuals
involved in the off-campus
disruption at Stanford Research
Institute's branch facility. Several
faculty members, also acting on
their own initiative, circulated
information on the objectives and
tactics advocated by various
protest groups. Student volunteers
pointed out and criticized specific

tactics used to build support for
the demonstrations. At the
initiative of Stanford faculty
members, individual professors
from ten California colleges and
universities recently met at
Stanford to extend this kind of
activity on a state-wide basis next
fall.
These voluntary activities,
together with the many official
actions listed earlier, all point in
the same direction—toward a
growing sentiment on campus
against disruptive acts. Obviously,
these measures can provide no
guarantee that such acts will not
occur again, but they do provide
some assurance that support for
disruptive acts can be limited and
that internal mechanisms can
work.
To me, it is clear that the roots
of campus disruption lie in the
most intractable problems of
American society and
government. The universities are
hit first and hardest because they
are not as easily protected as
other social institutions.
The war, and the many ways in
which impatient, idealistic youth
see us as falling short of our stated
goals and values—these are the
roots of the trouble.
Certainly it is a mistake to
describe the most disruptive
students as idealists. But their
great weapon is an appeal to the
idealism of others. When that
appeal fails—as much of the time
it does—the small minority of
revolutionaries is frustrated, and
their influence is substantially
blunted. When, as happened this
spring at Stanford, the appeal to
idealism gets a broad response, the
headlines are easily generated and
the trouble is not easily ended.
Let me make it perfectly clear:
We realize there is a small, hard
core of militant radicals
committed to the destruction of
our institutions, including our
universities.
It would not be too difficult to
deal with this group alone. The
difficulty arises from the
sympathy of a large group of
idealists for certain stated
objectives of the radicals and the
accompanying sensitivity of the
idealists to any unfairness or
arbitrariness in disciplinary action.
The tough problem is to
prevent the radicals from
expanding their ranks. On more
than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results. It
has driven large numbers of the
uncommitted and the moderate to
the militants' side and also has
created deep divisions within the
campus community which will
require years to heal.
As the National Commission
notes:
" . . .there is reason to believe
that a primary objective of
campus revolutionaries is to
provoke the calling of police and
the kinds of police conduct that
will bring the majority over to
their side."
While universities were almost
wholly unprepared to handle the
threat of disruption when it
began, a few short years ago, we
are learning. We are beginning to
have some successes to offset the
many setbacks that have made
headlines.
We do see a turning point.
Moderate students and faculty are
showing greater awareness of the
threat that disruptive tactics
create for an academic
community. We at Stanford have
tried to prepare for whatever
action might be required
including police action—rather
than trying to pretend it could
neVer happen.
We have obtained a restraining
order and a court injunction.
While these procedures are no
cure-all, they seem to have been
effective: though mentioned

publicly as targets for disruption,
neither my inauguration as
president nor commencement
exercises were disturbed this year,
causing a local paper to remark
that Stanford had an
"old-fashioned commencement
weekend."
One of our great concerns now
is that the turning point may have
come too late—that we may find
ourselves the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we continue to work hard to
solve these problems for ourselves.
Efforts of universities across
the country to strengthen their
own campus judicial mechanisms
will be seriously undermined if
withdrawal of federal aid for
those found guilty of disruptive
acts becomes wholly automatic,
regardless of the seriousness of the
offense or the extent of
punishment.
In fact, the riders on
appropriations bills so far do more
harm than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus. They offend the
classic American instinct to take
care of one's own problems.
First, they penalize the poor
but not the rich. Only when
campus sanctions require the
separation of an individual from
college are the rich and the poor
treated equally. In that event, of
course, federal aid automatically
ends.
Second, our experience has
been that most campus disrupters
are not economically deprived and
hence do not receive federal aid.
Thus federally imposed sanctions
have little effect on hard core
leadership.
Third, in those relatively few
cases where withdrawal of federal
aid might force a student
otherwise eligible to continue his
studies to leave a university, the
sanctions strike at the heart of a
college's autonomy and
independence—at its freedom to
determine who is and who is not
eligible to be a student.
These inequities greatly
complicate any effort to build and
maintain consensus within the
academic community on those
rules and sanctions which will
effectively curb disruption
without violating First
Amendment freedoms.
The National Commission
stated this problem well when it
said:
"More than seven million
young Americans are enrolled in
the nation's colleges and
universities; the vast majority
neither participate in nor
sympathize with campus violence.
"If aid is withdrawn from even
a few students in a manner that
the campus views as unjust, the
result may be to radicalize a much
larger number by convincing them
that existing governmental
institutions are as inhumane as the
revolutionaries claim."
We have devoted much time,
energy, and effort to developing
our own internal judicial and
governance procedures in ways
which will attract the widest
possible support. Having made
this effort, we so far have been
able to seek assistance when
necessary from the courts and
civil authorities without
destroying that same consensus.
We seek to build a university
community which honors ideals
and rejects coercion.
The modern university best
serves society when it functions as
a center for the free discussion of
ideas. It cannot long endure any
repression of free thought,
whether imposed from within or
from without. Nor can it function
as an armed camp amid warring
social factions.
