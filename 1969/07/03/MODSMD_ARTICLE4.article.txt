# Independence

### 
On the evening of the fourth of July 1776, the Continental Congress
sitting in Philadelphia, voted to accept the Declaration of
Independence. Two days previously the body had adopted a resolution
of independence. The Declaration, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, was
intended as a justification of that resolution.
This was the same Jefferson who would later write:
"1 hold it, that a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing, and
as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
"God forbid we should ever be twenty years without .. .a
rebellion."
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the
blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure."
In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson asserted that men
were born equally free. He averred that they possessed natural rights to
"life,, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"—rights wliicli were inherent,
inalienable, and indefeasible.
These rights belong to the people, not to the state. Governments are
instituted among men solely to secure these rights. If the government
becomes destructive of these ends, the natural right of revolution
obtains. If the government allows the violation of people's rights by the
government itself or by others, then, Jefferson contended, "it is the
right of the people to alter or abolish it."
Two weeks before his death, Jefferson wrote what is his last extant
letter. It was in reply to an invitation from the city of Washington,
D.C., to take part in a celebration of the 50th anniversary of America's
independence.
Jefferson regretted that ill health prevented him from attending. He
added, in what essayist Albert Jay Nock called "a singularly happy
formulation, the clearest and most forceful that he ever made" of this
lifelong belief of his, that "the mass of mankind has not been born with
saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to
ride them legitimately, by the grace of God."
Whatever happened to the revolutionary impetus that culminated in
the Declaration of Independence and the events which accompanied it?
Progressive historian Vernon L. Parrington contends in his writings that
there was a shift in American thought in the period between the
Declaration and the adoption of the Constitution. Parrington declares:
"This marked the turning point in American development; the
checking of the long movement of decentralization and the beginning
of a counter movement of centralization—the most revolutionary
change in three hundred years of American experience. The history of
the rise of the coercive state in America, with the ultimate arrest of all
centrifugal tendencies, was implicit in that momentous counter
movement."
This conservative trend was only partially modified during the
Jeffersonian and Jacksonian eras. Yet the spirit of' 76 lives today in our
contemporary equivalents of the Stamp Act riots and the Boston tea
party.
The radical implications of Jefferson's Declaration of Independence
have been smothered during the political socialization administered in
high school civics courses across America. This misunderstood
document has now been co-opted into the mythology which sustains
people's support for the American system. But the Declaration's words
are among the most subversive ever penned.
Jefferson included in the Declaration a bill of particulars drawn up
against the British crown. Many of the grievances which he detailed are
similar to those which feed discontent in America today: "swarms of
officers" sent to harass the people, the ascendency of military over
civilian power, standing armies kept among the people (the use of the
National Guard from Wilmington, Delaware, to Berkeley, California),
taxation without consent, and impressment of citizens.
It is time for Americans to live up to their radical heritage.

saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to
ride them legitimately, by the grace of God."
Whatever happened to the revolutionary impetus that culminated in
the Declaration of Independence and the events which accompanied it?
Progressive historian Vernon L. Parrington contends in his writings that
there was a shift in American thought in the period between the
Declaration and the adoption of the Constitution. Parrington declares:
"This marked the turning point in American development; the
checking of the long movement of decentralization and the beginning
of a counter movement of centralization—the most revolutionary
change in three hundred years of American experience. The history of
the rise of the coercive state in America, with the ultimate arrest of all
centrifugal tendencies, was implicit in that momentous counter
movement."
This conservative trend was only partially modified during the
Jeffersonian and Jacksonian eras. Yet the spirit of' 76 lives today in our
contemporary equivalents of the Stamp Act riots and the Boston tea
party.
The radical implications of Jefferson's Declaration of Independence
have been smothered during the political socialization administered in
high school civics courses across America. This misunderstood
document has now been co-opted into the mythology which sustains
people's support for the American system. But the Declaration's words
are among the most subversive ever penned.
Jefferson included in the Declaration a bill of particulars drawn up
against the British crown. Many of the grievances which he detailed are
similar to those which feed discontent in America today: "swarms of
officers" sent to harass the people, the ascendency of military over
civilian power, standing armies kept among the people (the use of the
National Guard from Wilmington, Delaware, to Berkeley, California),
taxation without consent, and impressment of citizens.
It is time for Americans to live up to their radical heritage.
On the evening of the fourth of July 1776, the Continental Congress
sitting in Philadelphia, voted to accept the Declaration of
Independence. Two days previously the body had adopted a resolution
of independence. The Declaration, drafted by Thomas Jefferson, was
intended as a justification of that resolution.
This was the same Jefferson who would later write:
"1 hold it, that a little rebellion, now and then, is a good thing, and
as necessary in the political world as storms in the physical."
"God forbid we should ever be twenty years without .. .a
rebellion."
"The tree of liberty must be refreshed from time to time with the
blood of patriots and tyrants. It is its natural manure."
In the Declaration of Independence, Jefferson asserted that men
were born equally free. He averred that they possessed natural rights to
"life,, liberty and the pursuit of happiness"—rights wliicli were inherent,
inalienable, and indefeasible.
These rights belong to the people, not to the state. Governments are
instituted among men solely to secure these rights. If the government
becomes destructive of these ends, the natural right of revolution
obtains. If the government allows the violation of people's rights by the
government itself or by others, then, Jefferson contended, "it is the
right of the people to alter or abolish it."
Two weeks before his death, Jefferson wrote what is his last extant
letter. It was in reply to an invitation from the city of Washington,
D.C., to take part in a celebration of the 50th anniversary of America's
independence.
Jefferson regretted that ill health prevented him from attending. He
added, in what essayist Albert Jay Nock called "a singularly happy
formulation, the clearest and most forceful that he ever made" of this
lifelong belief of his, that "the mass of mankind has not been born with
saddles on their backs, nor a favored few booted and spurred, ready to
ride them legitimately, by the grace of God."
