The Board of Trustees
approved a general site for the
development of junior faculty and
staff housing rental units, along
the north side of Bowdoin Street
west of the campus swim club, at
their last meeting.
The junior faculty and staff
project is part of a long-range
study conducted 'for this and
other faculty-staff housing needs.
The University Planning office
made the study at the request of
the faculty subcommittee on
faculty-staff housing.
With the approval of the site
for the junior faculty and staff

housing rental units, studies are
expected to begin soon on specific
proposals regarding size, design,
and the number of persons the
facility will accommodate.
However, it is hoped that 60 or
more garden apartments or town
houses will be constructed on a
site of approximately four acres.
It is expected that the units will
range from one to four bedrooms
each, with the possibility of
multiple story—but not high
rise —construction. Some units
may be furnished.
Edward A. Scoles, assistant
business manager for University
housing, says that the units are
expected to be in an economical
rental range.
He emphasizes that because the
site only has been approved, the
planning is speculative and details
must be considered thoroughly
before any decisions can be made.
