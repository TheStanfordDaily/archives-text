# Undergrad Dean Proposal
## 
### 
The Floor Management
Committee headed by Physics
Professor W.E. Meyerhof met last
week to discuss the coordination
of the July 24 Academic Senate
Meeting, which will discuss the
SES recommendation for a Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
The proposed Dean could have
overwhelming power. The
proposal reads in part: The Dean
is "to exercise continuing review
of Stanford's education of

undergraduates, to support and
maintain what is good through aid
in the renovation of what is
inadequate, and to stimulate and
assist educational innovation."
As liaison from the
administration to the students,
the Dean's job has looming
political overtones in light of
recent campus unrest.
Professor Meyerhof has asked
all concerned students, staff, and
faculty to contact him about the

proposal. Anyone wishing to air
his views before the Senate,
should detail an abstract of his
opinions and a general speech
outline for Professor Meyerhof
before July 18.
It should be delivered to his
office, 152 Varian, before July
18. Speakers for five minute
presentations at the Senate
meeting will be chosen from these
abstracts.
