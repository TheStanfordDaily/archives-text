# Sounds Like Summer
## Random Records In Review 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
I have been listening to several
new record releases, and I'd like
to share them with you. They
split between the Renaissance and
jazz, but perhaps you'll find
something here which interests
you.
German and English
Renaissance music for brass is
magnificently performed on a
recent Vox Candide release by the
Eastman Brass Quintet, among the
best such groups in the world. The
recording was made in the Grand
Ballroom of the Manhatten
Towers Hotel in New York, using
the new Dolby Signal/Noise
Stretcher, which produces an
unbelievable depth, but without a
"ghost."
The sound is exceedingly crisp
and clear, with none of the flutter
or harshness characteristic of
many brass ensemble albums. The
mood shifts from that of lofty
religious music to sprightly dance
tunes to ceremonial processionals,
all from the Renaissance and
Baroque periods.
English music is on one side of
the album, where several
composers are represented,
notably Thomas Weelkes; on the
German side, however, only the
works of Samuel Scheidt are
included.
Program Carefully Chosen
This slight misrepresentation is
no drawback to the quality of the
album, however, for the program
has been carefully chosen to
sample all styles of composition
of this period.
Personnel of the Quintet are
Daniel Patrylak and Philip Collins,
trumpets; Verne Reynolds,
French Horn; Donald Knaub,
trombone; and Cherry

Beauregard, tuba. This is truly a
masterful recording.
Warner Bros, has just released a
relaxing, misty sort of album with
Louie Shelton on guitar, called
"Touch Me." Building on his
Memphis-Nashville background,
and influenced strongly by Django
Reinhardt, Louie has cut two
really imaginative sides.
Mostly New Arrangements
Some of the songs are his own
("Theme for a Rainy Day," "A
Walk in the Country"), but most
are new arrangements of pop
tunes such as "Son of a Preacher
Man," "Everyday People," "I
Wanna Be Free," and "She's
Leaving Home." I especially liked
"Whiter Shade of Pale" and the
title song.
This album may seem too
commercial to some who want
their jazz and rock straight or not
at all, but I liked Louie's mixed
drink as rhythmic, unobtrussive
background or "easy listening"
music.
The fine arrangements, mostly
by H.B. Barnum and Don
McGinnis, are strong, with a good
feeling of motion. Louie is backed
up by John Galley on keyboard
bass and organ, Bill Lewis and Jim
Gordon on percussion, with a
good orchestra and rather
superfluous chorus. On the whole,
an enjoyable album.
New Mann
"Memphis Underground" is
Herbie Mann's latest LP, and it
adds another star to the creative
flutists already-sparkling heaven.
The title song and "Battle Hymn
of the Republic" are the best cuts,
both written by Herbie.
Herbie stays in the ensemble
most of the time (Roy Ayers,
vibes; Larry Coryell and Sonny

Sharrock, guitars), standing out
only on solos and ad libs. He
really flies on "Battle Hymn,"
which I found to be an especially
moving interpretation of a tune
which has seen use as church
music, bawdy ballad, and freedom
song.
Herbie plays it like a song of
today, and manages to capture
feelings of frustration, anger, and
action, bringing the melody
up-to-date. This album could well
serve as your introduction to
Herbie Mann, if you have always
considered good jazz the realm of
saxes and horns.
Freeport Convention
A new group named Freeport
Convention has their first album
out, and it's a good one.
Instrumentally, it contains the
usual group of guitars, organ and
occasional sitar, with a girl singer
named Alexandra Elene Mac Lean
Denny who sounds a little like
Judy Collins and puts out like
Grace Slick.
As a matter of fact, the whole
album reminds me somewhat of
"Surrealistic Pillow," which is a
fantastic compliment, since I
consider that album, the Doors
first one, and "Sgt. Pepper" to be
the three best rock albums out
since I started to listen.
The songs of "Freeport
Convention" were ail written by
the group, with the exception of
one by Joni Mitchell ("Eastern
Rain") and one by Dylan ("I'll
Keep it withmine"). "End of a
Holiday" is much like "Embyonic
Journey," (and very good), but
"Nottamun Town" was my
favorite cut; AEMD is at her best
on it. The instrumental work in
general is good, although not

great; ad libs are not particularly
inspired.
Now that the movie has been
released (and the WHOLE story
told,) Tetragrammaton has come
out with the sound track of Che!
(he wass ah man!). I haven't seen
the flick ("Shocking! But True!"),
but I imagine most of us would
like the music better than the
editorial and directing policy,
regardless of our political
affiliations. Lalo Schifrin, whom I
greatly respect as composer,
arranger and jazz pianist, did the
music.
I have only heard the 45 of the
theme song, which had a lot of
good rhythm but not much above
it (I suspect it was geared to the
action on celluloid.) Still, I have
enough confidence in Lalo Schifrin
(of "Mission Impossible" fame) to
believe that the LP, to be released
shortly, will be worth listening to.

fantastic compliment, since I
consider that album, the Doors
first one, and "Sgt. Pepper" to be
the three best rock albums out
since I started to listen.
The songs of "Freeport
Convention" were ail written by
the group, with the exception of
one by Joni Mitchell ("Eastern
Rain") and one by Dylan ("I'll
Keep it withmine"). "End of a
Holiday" is much like "Embyonic
Journey," (and very good), but
"Nottamun Town" was my
favorite cut; AEMD is at her best
on it. The instrumental work in
general is good, although not

great; ad libs are not particularly
inspired.
Now that the movie has been
released (and the WHOLE story
told,) Tetragrammaton has come
out with the sound track of Che!
(he wass ah man!). I haven't seen
the flick ("Shocking! But True!"),
but I imagine most of us would
like the music better than the
editorial and directing policy,
regardless of our political
affiliations. Lalo Schifrin, whom I
greatly respect as composer,
arranger and jazz pianist, did the
music.
I have only heard the 45 of the
theme song, which had a lot of
good rhythm but not much above
it (I suspect it was geared to the
action on celluloid.) Still, I have
enough confidence in Lalo Schifrin
(of "Mission Impossible" fame) to
believe that the LP, to be released
shortly, will be worth listening to.
I have been listening to several
new record releases, and I'd like
to share them with you. They
split between the Renaissance and
jazz, but perhaps you'll find
something here which interests
you.
German and English
Renaissance music for brass is
magnificently performed on a
recent Vox Candide release by the
Eastman Brass Quintet, among the
best such groups in the world. The
recording was made in the Grand
Ballroom of the Manhatten
Towers Hotel in New York, using
the new Dolby Signal/Noise
Stretcher, which produces an
unbelievable depth, but without a
"ghost."
The sound is exceedingly crisp
and clear, with none of the flutter
or harshness characteristic of
many brass ensemble albums. The
mood shifts from that of lofty
religious music to sprightly dance
tunes to ceremonial processionals,
all from the Renaissance and
Baroque periods.
English music is on one side of
the album, where several
composers are represented,
notably Thomas Weelkes; on the
German side, however, only the
works of Samuel Scheidt are
included.
Program Carefully Chosen
This slight misrepresentation is
no drawback to the quality of the
album, however, for the program
has been carefully chosen to
sample all styles of composition
of this period.
Personnel of the Quintet are
Daniel Patrylak and Philip Collins,
trumpets; Verne Reynolds,
French Horn; Donald Knaub,
trombone; and Cherry

Beauregard, tuba. This is truly a
masterful recording.
Warner Bros, has just released a
relaxing, misty sort of album with
Louie Shelton on guitar, called
"Touch Me." Building on his
Memphis-Nashville background,
and influenced strongly by Django
Reinhardt, Louie has cut two
really imaginative sides.
Mostly New Arrangements
Some of the songs are his own
("Theme for a Rainy Day," "A
Walk in the Country"), but most
are new arrangements of pop
tunes such as "Son of a Preacher
Man," "Everyday People," "I
Wanna Be Free," and "She's
Leaving Home." I especially liked
"Whiter Shade of Pale" and the
title song.
This album may seem too
commercial to some who want
their jazz and rock straight or not
at all, but I liked Louie's mixed
drink as rhythmic, unobtrussive
background or "easy listening"
music.
The fine arrangements, mostly
by H.B. Barnum and Don
McGinnis, are strong, with a good
feeling of motion. Louie is backed
up by John Galley on keyboard
bass and organ, Bill Lewis and Jim
Gordon on percussion, with a
good orchestra and rather
superfluous chorus. On the whole,
an enjoyable album.
New Mann
"Memphis Underground" is
Herbie Mann's latest LP, and it
adds another star to the creative
flutists already-sparkling heaven.
The title song and "Battle Hymn
of the Republic" are the best cuts,
both written by Herbie.
Herbie stays in the ensemble
most of the time (Roy Ayers,
vibes; Larry Coryell and Sonny

Sharrock, guitars), standing out
only on solos and ad libs. He
really flies on "Battle Hymn,"
which I found to be an especially
moving interpretation of a tune
which has seen use as church
music, bawdy ballad, and freedom
song.
Herbie plays it like a song of
today, and manages to capture
feelings of frustration, anger, and
action, bringing the melody
up-to-date. This album could well
serve as your introduction to
Herbie Mann, if you have always
considered good jazz the realm of
saxes and horns.
Freeport Convention
A new group named Freeport
Convention has their first album
out, and it's a good one.
Instrumentally, it contains the
usual group of guitars, organ and
occasional sitar, with a girl singer
named Alexandra Elene Mac Lean
Denny who sounds a little like
Judy Collins and puts out like
Grace Slick.
As a matter of fact, the whole
album reminds me somewhat of
"Surrealistic Pillow," which is a
fantastic compliment, since I
consider that album, the Doors
first one, and "Sgt. Pepper" to be
the three best rock albums out

bass and organ, Bill Lewis and Jim
Gordon on percussion, with a
good orchestra and rather
superfluous chorus. On the whole,
an enjoyable album.
New Mann
"Memphis Underground" is
Herbie Mann's latest LP, and it
adds another star to the creative
flutists already-sparkling heaven.
The title song and "Battle Hymn
of the Republic" are the best cuts,
both written by Herbie.
Herbie stays in the ensemble
most of the time (Roy Ayers,
vibes; Larry Coryell and Sonny

Sharrock, guitars), standing out
only on solos and ad libs. He
really flies on "Battle Hymn,"
which I found to be an especially
moving interpretation of a tune
which has seen use as church
music, bawdy ballad, and freedom
song.
Herbie plays it like a song of
today, and manages to capture
feelings of frustration, anger, and
action, bringing the melody
up-to-date. This album could well
serve as your introduction to
Herbie Mann, if you have always
considered good jazz the realm of
saxes and horns.
Freeport Convention
A new group named Freeport
Convention has their first album
out, and it's a good one.
Instrumentally, it contains the
usual group of guitars, organ and
occasional sitar, with a girl singer
named Alexandra Elene Mac Lean
Denny who sounds a little like
Judy Collins and puts out like
Grace Slick.
As a matter of fact, the whole
album reminds me somewhat of
"Surrealistic Pillow," which is a
fantastic compliment, since I
consider that album, the Doors
first one, and "Sgt. Pepper" to be
the three best rock albums out
since I started to listen.
The songs of "Freeport
Convention" were ail written by
the group, with the exception of
one by Joni Mitchell ("Eastern
Rain") and one by Dylan ("I'll
Keep it withmine"). "End of a
Holiday" is much like "Embyonic
Journey," (and very good), but
"Nottamun Town" was my
favorite cut; AEMD is at her best
on it. The instrumental work in
general is good, although not

great; ad libs are not particularly
inspired.
Now that the movie has been
released (and the WHOLE story
told,) Tetragrammaton has come
out with the sound track of Che!
(he wass ah man!). I haven't seen
the flick ("Shocking! But True!"),
but I imagine most of us would
like the music better than the
editorial and directing policy,
regardless of our political
affiliations. Lalo Schifrin, whom I
greatly respect as composer,
arranger and jazz pianist, did the
music.
I have only heard the 45 of the
theme song, which had a lot of
good rhythm but not much above
it (I suspect it was geared to the
action on celluloid.) Still, I have
enough confidence in Lalo Schifrin
(of "Mission Impossible" fame) to
believe that the LP, to be released
shortly, will be worth listening to.
I have been listening to several
new record releases, and I'd like
to share them with you. They
split between the Renaissance and
jazz, but perhaps you'll find
something here which interests
you.
German and English
Renaissance music for brass is
magnificently performed on a
recent Vox Candide release by the
Eastman Brass Quintet, among the
best such groups in the world. The
recording was made in the Grand
Ballroom of the Manhatten
Towers Hotel in New York, using
the new Dolby Signal/Noise
Stretcher, which produces an
unbelievable depth, but without a
"ghost."
The sound is exceedingly crisp
and clear, with none of the flutter
or harshness characteristic of
many brass ensemble albums. The
mood shifts from that of lofty
religious music to sprightly dance
tunes to ceremonial processionals,
all from the Renaissance and
Baroque periods.
English music is on one side of
the album, where several
composers are represented,
notably Thomas Weelkes; on the
German side, however, only the
works of Samuel Scheidt are
included.
Program Carefully Chosen
This slight misrepresentation is
no drawback to the quality of the
album, however, for the program
has been carefully chosen to
sample all styles of composition
of this period.
Personnel of the Quintet are
Daniel Patrylak and Philip Collins,
trumpets; Verne Reynolds,
French Horn; Donald Knaub,
trombone; and Cherry

Beauregard, tuba. This is truly a
masterful recording.
Warner Bros, has just released a
relaxing, misty sort of album with
Louie Shelton on guitar, called
"Touch Me." Building on his
Memphis-Nashville background,
and influenced strongly by Django
Reinhardt, Louie has cut two
really imaginative sides.
Mostly New Arrangements
Some of the songs are his own
("Theme for a Rainy Day," "A
Walk in the Country"), but most
are new arrangements of pop
tunes such as "Son of a Preacher
Man," "Everyday People," "I
Wanna Be Free," and "She's
Leaving Home." I especially liked
"Whiter Shade of Pale" and the
title song.
This album may seem too
commercial to some who want
their jazz and rock straight or not
at all, but I liked Louie's mixed
drink as rhythmic, unobtrussive
background or "easy listening"
music.
The fine arrangements, mostly
by H.B. Barnum and Don
McGinnis, are strong, with a good
feeling of motion. Louie is backed
up by John Galley on keyboard
bass and organ, Bill Lewis and Jim
Gordon on percussion, with a
good orchestra and rather
superfluous chorus. On the whole,
an enjoyable album.
