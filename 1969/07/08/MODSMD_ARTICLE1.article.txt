# Classified Projects May Move To SRI
## 
### 
Several classified contracts at
Stanford are now being reviewed
and may be transferred to
Stanford Research Institute, it
was disclosed at the McClellan
hearings last week.
Prof. William Rambo, director
of the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories, told the Senate
Permanent Investigating
Subcommittee that six classified
contracts, involving a total of
about $2 million in annual
support, will be "seriously
affected" by the faculty's
tightened standards on secret
campus research.
There is no pressure from the
faculty to end any part of the
program abruptly, he added, and
"consequently we hope to bring
about reasonable solutions to
what otherwise would be serious
problems.
"We regard this orderly
transition as a most important
immediate undertaking. I am
optimistic that it will prove
feasible to move this work to a
more favorable outside
environment, and to staff it
largely with former members of
the Applied Electronics
Laboratory professional research

group in such a way that the
interests of the government
sponsors in this research will not
be jeopardized."
A3M Helped Death
Rambo told the subcommittee
that "without a doubt, the
pressure exerted by the April
Third Movement accelerated the
demise of (the applied research)
program."
Many researchers have decided
to leave campus, he added.
He called the AEL sit-in "a
great victory for the A3M,"
noting that it still "enjoys a
certain popular regard in the
community.
"In a sense," he added, "it was
a victory as well for the
administration, though of the
Dunkirk variety." The sit-in was
"remarkably effective in
educating all of us with respect to
the need for new measures for
dealing" with large-scale
disruptions, Rambo said.
Encina Occupation
Measures developed in this
demonstration proved helpful in
bringing the Encina occupation to
a prompt end two weeks later, he
noted. In addition, "it is indeed

significant that there was no
actual physical violence of
substance, and no permanent
philosophical divisions were
generated in the university
community as a whole.
"This is important in that the
door remains open to the internal
development of orderly processes
to contain future disruptions,"
Rambo concluded.
John S. Foster, Jr., director of
defense research and engineering
of the Department of Defense,
disclosed that the possibility of
transferring certain university
programs to SRI was under
consideration.
"Punitive action by the Federal
government probably would not
be helpful on any of the campuses
in which defense research and
development has become
controversial," he said.
"Responsibility for law and
order on the campuses rests with
the university authorities."
Charles A. Anderson, President
of Stanford Research Institute,
said SRI had successfully
maintained a position of firmness
in meeting student demonstrators.
