• Trailer Progress
July 15 is the date for the
beginning of the mobile home
installations in the vacant area
adjacent to Branner Hall. They are
presently being moved from the
manufacturer to the Wilbur
parking lot in two sections.
Each section is ten by fifty-one
feet, and when completely
assembled the entire home will be
twenty by fifty-one feet and
contain approximately 1000
square feet.
All units have three bedrooms,
two baths, a kitchen, and a living
room and are fully carpeted. They
feature natural wood panelling
and have all the utilities normally
found in a conventional home.
At present, the installation and
assembly of the mobile homes is
on schedule. If events continue as
smoothly, the final thirty units

should be in place by July 28, and
ready for occupancy by the
beginning of fall quarter.
There are 117 units, each
housing four students, who were
assigned there through the
housing draw system this spring.
The mobile homes will be
arranged in clusters of four
around a patio area. Also planned
for the site is a central permanent
facility which will contain a coin
operated laundry, an office, and
lounge.

housing draw system this spring.
The mobile homes will be
arranged in clusters of four
around a patio area. Also planned
for the site is a central permanent
facility which will contain a coin
operated laundry, an office, and
lounge.

• Pass Fail
The Steering Committee of the

current policies regarding
Pass/Fail grading last month. At
present, students may take a
maximum of twenty-seven units
of Pass/Fail courses in areas other
than those required for graduation
by their major department, or
those necessary to meet General
Studies requirements.
The "pass" or "fail" is entered

grades, and the hours successfully
completed are counted as credits
for graduation. Hours graded
"pass" or "fail" are not included
in computation of the student's
grade point average.
