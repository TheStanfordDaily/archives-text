# Swarthmore Dean
## Admissions Head Named 
### 
Fred A. Hargadon, dean of
admissions at Swarthmore College
since 1964, will become Stanford
University's dean of admissions
this fall, President Kenneth S.
Pitzer announced today.
He replaces Rixford K. Snyder,
who after 19 years in the position,
left it last month to become
director of alumni attitude
research and director of alumni
colleges abroad for the Stanford
Alumni Association.

psychology and education.
Working with Hilgard were
Douglas D. Anderson, freshman;
Rodolpho Cancino, law student;
Lincoln E. Moses, professor of
statistics; William D. Nix,
associate professor of materials
science; Gertrude L. Schuelke,
professor of German; and James
E.< Simmons, assistant to the
president for intergroup relations.
Important Position
"The Dean of Admissions is a

very important position,
particularly now when we are
trying to change the character of
our student body," Hilgard said.
"We found many highly
competent people in our search,
and are very happy that the
committee's first choice accepted
President Pitzer's invitation. His
record at Swarthmore is
impressive, particularly in his
handling of enlistment of
minority students."
A new, more flexible policy on
admissions, which seeks greater
academic and social diversity
among incoming students, was
adopted last fall by the faculty.
Last spring, Stanford committee
itself to doubling minority
enrollment by the 1969-70
academic vear.
"The minority communities
are indeed fortunate that Stanford
is able to attract a man with the
sensitivity of Mr. Hargadon," said
Simmons. "The committee feels
he understands well the black and
Mexican-American communities
and certainly will continue efforts
already under way and

significantly increase their
enrollment at Stanford."
At Swarthmore, Hargadon has
taught at least one course a
semester in comparative
government, political theory, and
Soviet politics, while serving as
dean of admissions. He joined the
