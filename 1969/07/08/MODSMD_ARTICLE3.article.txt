# Miller Takes Over As Business Dean
## 
### 
Arjay Miller, former vice
chairman of the board of Ford
Motor Company, has taken over
duties as dean of the Stanford
Graduate School of Business,
effective last Tuesday.
Miller, 53, is fourth dean of the
Business School since the School's
establishment in 1925. He
succeeds Ernest C. Arbuckle, now
chairman of the board of Wells
Fargo Bank, who resigned as dean
a year ago.
Miller joined Ford in 1946,
rising through a series of
responsible positions to the
presidency in 1963. He served as
president until 1968, when he was
named vice chairman of the
board. While at Ford, Miller
demonstrated an intense interest
in the training of competent

managers for both private and
public service.
This interest was further
reflected in his agreeing to serve as
first chairman of the board of the
Urban Institute, an independent
agency recently created by
President Johnson to serve as the
federal government's center for
research on urban problems.
He also is a trustee of the
Brookings Institution, the
Committee for Economic
Development, the National
Industrial Conference Board, and
the Kent School, Kent, Ct.
In reference to his new job, he
has said that "business schools
have an obligation to pioneer and
to teach business what to do if it
is to remain a progressive, viable
force in our national and world
societies."
