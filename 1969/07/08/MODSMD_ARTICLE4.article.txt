# Excerpts From Hearing
## Pitzer vs. McClellan 
### 
Editor's Note: What follows
are excerpts from a transcription
of the questioning of Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer before
the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations of the Senate
Committee on Government
Operations on July 1. Dramatis
personae in order of their first
appearance: Karl E. Mundt
(R-N.D.), Kenneth S. Pitzer, John
L. McClellan (D-Ark.), and
Charles Percy (R-Ill.).
Mundt: If I interpret correctly
the thrust of those two
statements, you (Pitzer) are saying
the Federal Government has a
perfect right to offer grant
programs, to provide aid
programs, but has no right to
determine the terms of eligibility
of the students receiving them.
If that is what you mean, I
would have to disagree. I agree
with what you say, but it is the
implication that concerns me.
I think the Federal
Government has just as much
right to exercise its freedom to
determine what students under
what criteria are going to be
eligible to receive Federal aid as
your university has to detemine
who is eligible to be a student.
Do you deny that?
Pitzer: Of course not, Senator
Mundt. I agree with you
completely. It is the Federal
Government's full right to
determine whatever policies it
wishes in this area.
I am speaking only to what I
would regard as the wiser policy,
one that would be more helpful to
oeonlp -if -

trying to restore order to the
campuses as best possible . . .
It is not a matter of your right.
It is just a matter that we would
like our opinion recorded for your
consideration in your decision.
Mundt: . . . But you should be
aware of the fact that this
troublesome problem is not one
that can be solved unilaterally by
administrators using the money
that Congress makes available to
them.
We have some responsibility
ourselves to our constituents, to
the taxpayers. We have some
responsibility to see what is done
with the money that we make
available for "educational
purposes."
There is a grave danger that if
we don't take some action to
demonstrate that responsibility,
you are going to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg. I doubt
very much that a Gallup Poll
taken in this country today, about
making aid to students on
campuses, would get a majority
vote . . .
I just don't believe a
Congressman or a Senator
measures up to his responsibility
to the public and to the taxpayers
if all we do is to express the pious
hope that all the college
presidents—and how many have
we, 3,000 of them or something
like that in this country, as you
know, or maybe we have too
many—
Pitzer: 2,000 is probably the
right number.
Mundt: If we are simply going

you work this out. Don't bother
us."
We have a responsibility to set
some standards and guidelines.

McClellan: Let me ask you
this: Do you plan now or are you
in a position to accept other
Government research work?
Pitzer: Oh, yes, we are
accepting the Government
research work very extensively.
McClellan: In the military
field?
Pitzer: We are accepting
unclassified research work very
extensively from the Defense
Department. We have about $17
million per year annual rate of
expenditure from the Defense
Department.
McClellan: I am not suggesting
this about your college or your
institution but this seems to be
one of the demands being made. I
am wondering if our institutions
and Government yield to that
demand, if then a further demand
will not be made and ultimately
we find that our Government can
not prepare to defend itself from
attack.
Pilzer: We are not yielding to
demands in this area, sir. We are
establishing what we think is the
best mutual policy between the
Federal Government and the
Universities, remembering that the
universities are primarily
educational institutions,
remembering, sir, as was said this
morning, that there is
dissatisfaction on the campus with
those who spend too much time

dissatisfaction on the campus with
those who spend too much time
on activities, faculty who spend
too much time on activities that
they can not discuss with
students, that are extraneous to
the educational process.
* * #
Percy: What portion of this
(federally-funded research) would
be sponsored by the Department
of Defense?
Pitzer: I think it is about $15
to $17 million that is sponsored
by the Department of Defense . . .
Percy: Of that amount, how
much was done at AEL?
Pitzer: A little over a million
dollars a year is the annual rate of
activity at AEL.
Percy: So it is a relatively small
proportion of the total you carry
on.
Pitzer: Yes, about 8 percent of
the Department of Defense's total
is carried on in the AEL.
Percy: Aside from the delay
caused by the disruption, is there
any indication that the University
won't be able to fulfill its
contractual obligation to DOD?
Pitzer: No, I am quite
confident that we can fulfill our
contractual obligations. Insofar as
work may be in the Government's
interest to transfer certain of the
work to other locations, this is
being done in an orderly fashion.
* * ♦
McClellan: I think that when
people take the law into their own
hands and violate the civil rights
of others and destroy their
property and prevent them from
getting their education, that a
little delay can be dangerous. The
best thing to do is to take
immediate action and get the
injunction or call the authorities
or do both and stop it right in the
beginning and don't let it run on
for eight or 10 days.
I think that is a mistake
anywhere because if people can
get their way in our institutions of
learning by these sorts of tactics,
then people on the outside of
institutions of learning feel
justified in using the same tactics

to get whatever they want in life.
It is something that presents a
sorry spectacle of our
higher-learning institutions when
conditions like these go on and we
kind of take an attitude, "Well,
we can't do anything about it, but
we are trying." I feel something
can be done about it.
I commend you for your
sincere efforts to do something
about it. I think this applies all
over the country. These
conditions can't continue. They
have to be eliminated. I don't
know whether more laws are
needed or not. That is what we
are trying to find out.
The one law I stand for is not
giving taxpayers' dollars to these
rabble-rousing, violent instigators,
crime-committers who get their
way about higher institutions of
learning. I am opposed to
supporting them with my taxes,
out of my neighbor's taxes or
anybody else's taxes.
* * *
McClellan: Let me ask you one
question there. Can't there be a
rule against obscenity? Can't there
be a rule against using this vile
language towards the
administration of the school and
towards our Government?
Can't that be justification for
suspension or for expulsion
without violating any First
Amendment? ... As long as you
tolerate it in public, as long as it is
tolerated and permitted and you
do nothing about it except to try
to educate them not to do it, I
don't think you will ever succeed
that way.
I don't think you will succeed
in crime if you didn't have some
laws to enforce against crime.
I just don't understand today
that we have become, so
intimidated that we are afraid to
use any authority to enforce
proper conduct in our colleges.
Pitzer: As I think I have
indicated, we have used authority,
and we have suspended students.
McClellan: I thought you were
saying that you have to get a
consensus. They never had any
consensus in my hone. When I did
something my parents thought
was wrong, we didn't have a
consensus. We didn't have
consensus in school. If a child
misbehaved he got punished for it.

to educate them not to do it, I
don't think you will ever succeed
that way.
I don't think you will succeed
in crime if you didn't have some
laws to enforce against crime.
I just don't understand today
that we have become, so
intimidated that we are afraid to
use any authority to enforce
proper conduct in our colleges.
Pitzer: As I think I have
indicated, we have used authority,
and we have suspended students.
McClellan: I thought you were
saying that you have to get a
consensus. They never had any
consensus in my hone. When I did
something my parents thought
was wrong, we didn't have a
consensus. We didn't have
consensus in school. If a child
misbehaved he got punished for it.
Editor's Note: What follows
are excerpts from a transcription
of the questioning of Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer before
the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations of the Senate
Committee on Government
Operations on July 1. Dramatis
personae in order of their first
appearance: Karl E. Mundt
(R-N.D.), Kenneth S. Pitzer, John
L. McClellan (D-Ark.), and
Charles Percy (R-Ill.).
Mundt: If I interpret correctly
the thrust of those two
statements, you (Pitzer) are saying
the Federal Government has a
perfect right to offer grant
programs, to provide aid
programs, but has no right to
determine the terms of eligibility
of the students receiving them.
If that is what you mean, I
would have to disagree. I agree
with what you say, but it is the
implication that concerns me.
I think the Federal
Government has just as much
right to exercise its freedom to
determine what students under
what criteria are going to be
eligible to receive Federal aid as
your university has to detemine
who is eligible to be a student.
Do you deny that?
Pitzer: Of course not, Senator
Mundt. I agree with you
completely. It is the Federal
Government's full right to
determine whatever policies it
wishes in this area.
I am speaking only to what I
would regard as the wiser policy,
one that would be more helpful to
oeonlp -if -

trying to restore order to the
campuses as best possible . . .
It is not a matter of your right.
It is just a matter that we would
like our opinion recorded for your
consideration in your decision.
Mundt: . . . But you should be
aware of the fact that this
troublesome problem is not one
that can be solved unilaterally by
administrators using the money
that Congress makes available to
them.
We have some responsibility
ourselves to our constituents, to
the taxpayers. We have some
responsibility to see what is done
with the money that we make
available for "educational
purposes."
There is a grave danger that if
we don't take some action to
demonstrate that responsibility,
you are going to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg. I doubt
very much that a Gallup Poll
taken in this country today, about
making aid to students on
campuses, would get a majority
vote . . .
I just don't believe a
Congressman or a Senator
measures up to his responsibility
to the public and to the taxpayers
if all we do is to express the pious
hope that all the college
presidents—and how many have
we, 3,000 of them or something
like that in this country, as you
know, or maybe we have too
many—
Pitzer: 2,000 is probably the
right number.
Mundt: If we are simply going

you work this out. Don't bother
us."
We have a responsibility to set
some standards and guidelines.
* * *
McClellan: Let me ask you
this: Do you plan now or are you
in a position to accept other
Government research work?
Pitzer: Oh, yes, we are
accepting the Government
research work very extensively.
McClellan: In the military
field?
Pitzer: We are accepting
unclassified research work very
extensively from the Defense
Department. We have about $17
million per year annual rate of
expenditure from the Defense
Department.
McClellan: I am not suggesting
this about your college or your
institution but this seems to be
one of the demands being made. I
am wondering if our institutions
and Government yield to that
demand, if then a further demand
will not be made and ultimately
we find that our Government can
not prepare to defend itself from
attack.
Pilzer: We are not yielding to
demands in this area, sir. We are
establishing what we think is the
best mutual policy between the
Federal Government and the
Universities, remembering that the
universities are primarily
educational institutions,
remembering, sir, as was said this
morning, that there is
dissatisfaction on the campus with
those who spend too much time
on activities, faculty who spend
too much time on activities that
they can not discuss with
students, that are extraneous to
the educational process.
* * #
Percy: What portion of this
(federally-funded research) would
be sponsored by the Department
of Defense?
Pitzer: I think it is about $15
to $17 million that is sponsored
by the Department of Defense . . .
Percy: Of that amount, how
much was done at AEL?
Pitzer: A little over a million
dollars a year is the annual rate of
activity at AEL.
Percy: So it is a relatively small
proportion of the total you carry
on.
Pitzer: Yes, about 8 percent of
the Department of Defense's total
is carried on in the AEL.
Percy: Aside from the delay
caused by the disruption, is there
any indication that the University
won't be able to fulfill its
contractual obligation to DOD?
Pitzer: No, I am quite
confident that we can fulfill our
contractual obligations. Insofar as
work may be in the Government's
interest to transfer certain of the
work to other locations, this is
being done in an orderly fashion.
* * ♦
McClellan: I think that when
people take the law into their own
hands and violate the civil rights
of others and destroy their
property and prevent them from
getting their education, that a
little delay can be dangerous. The
best thing to do is to take
immediate action and get the
injunction or call the authorities
or do both and stop it right in the
beginning and don't let it run on
for eight or 10 days.
I think that is a mistake
anywhere because if people can
get their way in our institutions of
learning by these sorts of tactics,
then people on the outside of
institutions of learning feel
justified in using the same tactics

to get whatever they want in life.
It is something that presents a
sorry spectacle of our
higher-learning institutions when
conditions like these go on and we
kind of take an attitude, "Well,
we can't do anything about it, but
we are trying." I feel something
can be done about it.
I commend you for your
sincere efforts to do something
about it. I think this applies all
over the country. These
conditions can't continue. They
have to be eliminated. I don't
know whether more laws are
needed or not. That is what we
are trying to find out.
The one law I stand for is not
giving taxpayers' dollars to these
rabble-rousing, violent instigators,
crime-committers who get their
way about higher institutions of
learning. I am opposed to
supporting them with my taxes,
out of my neighbor's taxes or
anybody else's taxes.
* * *
McClellan: Let me ask you one
question there. Can't there be a
rule against obscenity? Can't there
be a rule against using this vile
language towards the
administration of the school and
towards our Government?
Can't that be justification for
suspension or for expulsion
without violating any First
Amendment? ... As long as you
tolerate it in public, as long as it is
tolerated and permitted and you
do nothing about it except to try
to educate them not to do it, I
don't think you will ever succeed
that way.
I don't think you will succeed

The one law I stand for is not
giving taxpayers' dollars to these
rabble-rousing, violent instigators,
crime-committers who get their
way about higher institutions of
learning. I am opposed to
supporting them with my taxes,
out of my neighbor's taxes or
anybody else's taxes.

McClellan: Let me ask you one
question there. Can't there be a
rule against obscenity? Can't there
be a rule against using this vile
language towards the
administration of the school and
towards our Government?
Can't that be justification for
suspension or for expulsion
without violating any First
Amendment? ... As long as you
tolerate it in public, as long as it is
tolerated and permitted and you
do nothing about it except to try
to educate them not to do it, I
don't think you will ever succeed
that way.
I don't think you will succeed
in crime if you didn't have some
laws to enforce against crime.
I just don't understand today
that we have become, so
intimidated that we are afraid to
use any authority to enforce
proper conduct in our colleges.
Pitzer: As I think I have
indicated, we have used authority,
and we have suspended students.
McClellan: I thought you were
saying that you have to get a
consensus. They never had any
consensus in my hone. When I did
something my parents thought
was wrong, we didn't have a
consensus. We didn't have
consensus in school. If a child
misbehaved he got punished for it.
Editor's Note: What follows
are excerpts from a transcription
of the questioning of Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer before
the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations of the Senate
Committee on Government
Operations on July 1. Dramatis
personae in order of their first
appearance: Karl E. Mundt
(R-N.D.), Kenneth S. Pitzer, John
L. McClellan (D-Ark.), and
Charles Percy (R-Ill.).
Mundt: If I interpret correctly
the thrust of those two
statements, you (Pitzer) are saying
the Federal Government has a
perfect right to offer grant
programs, to provide aid
programs, but has no right to
determine the terms of eligibility
of the students receiving them.
If that is what you mean, I
would have to disagree. I agree
with what you say, but it is the
implication that concerns me.
I think the Federal
Government has just as much
right to exercise its freedom to
determine what students under
what criteria are going to be
eligible to receive Federal aid as
your university has to detemine
who is eligible to be a student.
Do you deny that?
Pitzer: Of course not, Senator
Mundt. I agree with you
completely. It is the Federal
Government's full right to
determine whatever policies it
wishes in this area.
I am speaking only to what I
would regard as the wiser policy,
one that would be more helpful to
oeonlp -if -

trying to restore order to the
campuses as best possible . . .
It is not a matter of your right.
It is just a matter that we would
like our opinion recorded for your
consideration in your decision.
Mundt: . . . But you should be
aware of the fact that this
troublesome problem is not one
that can be solved unilaterally by
administrators using the money
that Congress makes available to
them.
We have some responsibility
ourselves to our constituents, to
the taxpayers. We have some
responsibility to see what is done
with the money that we make
available for "educational
purposes."
There is a grave danger that if
we don't take some action to
demonstrate that responsibility,
you are going to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg. I doubt
very much that a Gallup Poll
taken in this country today, about
making aid to students on
campuses, would get a majority
vote . . .
I just don't believe a
Congressman or a Senator
measures up to his responsibility
to the public and to the taxpayers
if all we do is to express the pious
hope that all the college
presidents—and how many have
we, 3,000 of them or something
like that in this country, as you
know, or maybe we have too
many—
Pitzer: 2,000 is probably the
right number.
Mundt: If we are simply going

you work this out. Don't bother
us."
We have a responsibility to set
some standards and guidelines.
* * *
McClellan: Let me ask you
this: Do you plan now or are you
in a position to accept other
Government research work?
Pitzer: Oh, yes, we are
accepting the Government
research work very extensively.
McClellan: In the military
field?
Pitzer: We are accepting
unclassified research work very
extensively from the Defense
Department. We have about $17
million per year annual rate of
expenditure from the Defense
Department.
McClellan: I am not suggesting
this about your college or your
institution but this seems to be
one of the demands being made. I
am wondering if our institutions
and Government yield to that
demand, if then a further demand
will not be made and ultimately
we find that our Government can
not prepare to defend itself from
attack.
Pilzer: We are not yielding to
demands in this area, sir. We are
establishing what we think is the
best mutual policy between the
Federal Government and the
Universities, remembering that the
universities are primarily
educational institutions,
remembering, sir, as was said this
morning, that there is
dissatisfaction on the campus with
those who spend too much time
on activities, faculty who spend
too much time on activities that
they can not discuss with
students, that are extraneous to
the educational process.

Percy: What portion of this
(federally-funded research) would

of Defense?
Pitzer: I think it is about $15

by the Department of Defense . . .
Percy: Of that amount, how
much was done at AEL?
Pitzer: A little over a million
dollars a year is the annual rate of
activity at AEL.
Percy: So it is a relatively small
proportion of the total you carry
on.
Pitzer: Yes, about 8 percent of
the Department of Defense's total
is carried on in the AEL.
Percy: Aside from the delay
caused by the disruption, is there
any indication that the University
won't be able to fulfill its
contractual obligation to DOD?
Pitzer: No, I am quite
confident that we can fulfill our
contractual obligations. Insofar as
work may be in the Government's
interest to transfer certain of the
work to other locations, this is
being done in an orderly fashion.
* * ♦
McClellan: I think that when
people take the law into their own
hands and violate the civil rights
of others and destroy their
property and prevent them from
getting their education, that a
little delay can be dangerous. The
best thing to do is to take
immediate action and get the
injunction or call the authorities
or do both and stop it right in the
beginning and don't let it run on
for eight or 10 days.
I think that is a mistake
anywhere because if people can
get their way in our institutions of
learning by these sorts of tactics,
then people on the outside of
institutions of learning feel
justified in using the same tactics

to get whatever they want in life.
It is something that presents a
sorry spectacle of our
higher-learning institutions when
conditions like these go on and we
kind of take an attitude, "Well,
we can't do anything about it, but
we are trying." I feel something
can be done about it.
I commend you for your
sincere efforts to do something
about it. I think this applies all
over the country. These
conditions can't continue. They
have to be eliminated. I don't
know whether more laws are
needed or not. That is what we
are trying to find out.
The one law I stand for is not
giving taxpayers' dollars to these

anywhere because if people can
get their way in our institutions of
learning by these sorts of tactics,
then people on the outside of
institutions of learning feel
justified in using the same tactics

to get whatever they want in life.
It is something that presents a
sorry spectacle of our
higher-learning institutions when
conditions like these go on and we
kind of take an attitude, "Well,
we can't do anything about it, but
we are trying." I feel something
can be done about it.
I commend you for your
sincere efforts to do something
about it. I think this applies all
over the country. These
conditions can't continue. They
have to be eliminated. I don't
know whether more laws are
needed or not. That is what we
are trying to find out.
The one law I stand for is not
giving taxpayers' dollars to these
rabble-rousing, violent instigators,
crime-committers who get their
way about higher institutions of
learning. I am opposed to
supporting them with my taxes,
out of my neighbor's taxes or
anybody else's taxes.

McClellan: Let me ask you one
question there. Can't there be a
rule against obscenity? Can't there
be a rule against using this vile
language towards the
administration of the school and
towards our Government?
Can't that be justification for
suspension or for expulsion
without violating any First
Amendment? ... As long as you
tolerate it in public, as long as it is
tolerated and permitted and you
do nothing about it except to try
to educate them not to do it, I
don't think you will ever succeed
that way.
I don't think you will succeed
in crime if you didn't have some
laws to enforce against crime.
I just don't understand today
that we have become, so
intimidated that we are afraid to
use any authority to enforce
proper conduct in our colleges.
Pitzer: As I think I have
indicated, we have used authority,
and we have suspended students.
McClellan: I thought you were
saying that you have to get a
consensus. They never had any
consensus in my hone. When I did
something my parents thought
was wrong, we didn't have a
consensus. We didn't have
consensus in school. If a child
misbehaved he got punished for it.
Editor's Note: What follows
are excerpts from a transcription
of the questioning of Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer before
the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations of the Senate
Committee on Government
Operations on July 1. Dramatis
personae in order of their first
appearance: Karl E. Mundt
(R-N.D.), Kenneth S. Pitzer, John
L. McClellan (D-Ark.), and
Charles Percy (R-Ill.).
Mundt: If I interpret correctly
the thrust of those two
statements, you (Pitzer) are saying
the Federal Government has a
perfect right to offer grant
programs, to provide aid
programs, but has no right to
determine the terms of eligibility
of the students receiving them.
If that is what you mean, I
would have to disagree. I agree
with what you say, but it is the
implication that concerns me.
I think the Federal
Government has just as much
right to exercise its freedom to
determine what students under
what criteria are going to be
eligible to receive Federal aid as
your university has to detemine
who is eligible to be a student.
Do you deny that?
Pitzer: Of course not, Senator
Mundt. I agree with you
completely. It is the Federal
Government's full right to
determine whatever policies it
wishes in this area.
I am speaking only to what I
would regard as the wiser policy,
one that would be more helpful to
oeonlp -if -

trying to restore order to the
campuses as best possible . . .
It is not a matter of your right.
It is just a matter that we would
like our opinion recorded for your
consideration in your decision.
Mundt: . . . But you should be
aware of the fact that this
troublesome problem is not one
that can be solved unilaterally by
administrators using the money
that Congress makes available to
them.
We have some responsibility
ourselves to our constituents, to
the taxpayers. We have some
responsibility to see what is done
with the money that we make
available for "educational
purposes."
There is a grave danger that if
we don't take some action to
demonstrate that responsibility,
you are going to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg. I doubt
very much that a Gallup Poll
taken in this country today, about
making aid to students on
campuses, would get a majority
vote . . .
I just don't believe a
Congressman or a Senator
measures up to his responsibility
to the public and to the taxpayers
if all we do is to express the pious
hope that all the college
presidents—and how many have
we, 3,000 of them or something
like that in this country, as you
know, or maybe we have too
many—
Pitzer: 2,000 is probably the
right number.
Mundt: If we are simply going

you work this out. Don't bother
us."
We have a responsibility to set
some standards and guidelines.
* * *
McClellan: Let me ask you
this: Do you plan now or are you
in a position to accept other
Government research work?
Pitzer: Oh, yes, we are
accepting the Government
research work very extensively.
McClellan: In the military
field?
Pitzer: We are accepting
unclassified research work very
extensively from the Defense
Department. We have about $17
million per year annual rate of
expenditure from the Defense
Department.
McClellan: I am not suggesting
this about your college or your
institution but this seems to be
one of the demands being made. I
am wondering if our institutions
and Government yield to that
demand, if then a further demand
will not be made and ultimately
we find that our Government can
not prepare to defend itself from
attack.
Pilzer: We are not yielding to
demands in this area, sir. We are
establishing what we think is the
best mutual policy between the
Federal Government and the
Universities, remembering that the
universities are primarily
educational institutions,
remembering, sir, as was said this
morning, that there is
dissatisfaction on the campus with
those who spend too much time
on activities, faculty who spend
too much time on activities that
they can not discuss with
students, that are extraneous to
the educational process.
* * #
Percy: What portion of this
(federally-funded research) would
be sponsored by the Department
of Defense?
Pitzer: I think it is about $15
to $17 million that is sponsored
by the Department of Defense . . .
Percy: Of that amount, how
much was done at AEL?
Pitzer: A little over a million
dollars a year is the annual rate of
activity at AEL.
Percy: So it is a relatively small
proportion of the total you carry
on.
Pitzer: Yes, about 8 percent of
the Department of Defense's total
is carried on in the AEL.
Percy: Aside from the delay
caused by the disruption, is there
any indication that the University
won't be able to fulfill its
contractual obligation to DOD?
Pitzer: No, I am quite
confident that we can fulfill our
contractual obligations. Insofar as
work may be in the Government's
interest to transfer certain of the
work to other locations, this is
being done in an orderly fashion.
* * ♦
McClellan: I think that when
people take the law into their own
hands and violate the civil rights
of others and destroy their
property and prevent them from
getting their education, that a
little delay can be dangerous. The
best thing to do is to take
immediate action and get the
injunction or call the authorities
or do both and stop it right in the
beginning and don't let it run on
for eight or 10 days.
I think that is a mistake
anywhere because if people can
get their way in our institutions of
learning by these sorts of tactics,
then people on the outside of
