# Excerpts From Hearing
## Pitzer vs. McClellan 
### 
Editor's Note: What follows
are excerpts from a transcription
of the questioning of Stanford
President Kenneth Pitzer before
the Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations of the Senate
Committee on Government
Operations on July 1. Dramatis
personae in order of their first
appearance: Karl E. Mundt
(R-N.D.), Kenneth S. Pitzer, John
L. McClellan (D-Ark.), and
Charles Percy (R-Ill.).
Mundt: If I interpret correctly
the thrust of those two
statements, you (Pitzer) are saying
the Federal Government has a
perfect right to offer grant
programs, to provide aid
programs, but has no right to
determine the terms of eligibility
of the students receiving them.
If that is what you mean, I
would have to disagree. I agree
with what you say, but it is the
implication that concerns me.
I think the Federal
Government has just as much
right to exercise its freedom to
determine what students under
what criteria are going to be
eligible to receive Federal aid as
your university has to detemine
who is eligible to be a student.
Do you deny that?
Pitzer: Of course not, Senator
Mundt. I agree with you
completely. It is the Federal
Government's full right to
determine whatever policies it
wishes in this area.
I am speaking only to what I
would regard as the wiser policy,
one that would be more helpful to
oeonlp -if -

trying to restore order to the
campuses as best possible . . .
It is not a matter of your right.
It is just a matter that we would
like our opinion recorded for your
consideration in your decision.
Mundt: . . . But you should be
aware of the fact that this
troublesome problem is not one
that can be solved unilaterally by
administrators using the money
that Congress makes available to
them.
We have some responsibility
ourselves to our constituents, to
the taxpayers. We have some
responsibility to see what is done
with the money that we make
available for "educational
purposes."
There is a grave danger that if
we don't take some action to
demonstrate that responsibility,
you are going to kill the goose
that lays the golden egg. I doubt
very much that a Gallup Poll
taken in this country today, about
making aid to students on
campuses, would get a majority
vote . . .
I just don't believe a
Congressman or a Senator
measures up to his responsibility
to the public and to the taxpayers
if all we do is to express the pious
hope that all the college
presidents—and how many have
we, 3,000 of them or something
like that in this country, as you
know, or maybe we have too
many—
Pitzer: 2,000 is probably the
right number.
Mundt: If we are simply going

you work this out. Don't bother
us."
We have a responsibility to set
some standards and guidelines.

McClellan: Let me ask you
this: Do you plan now or are you
in a position to accept other
Government research work?
Pitzer: Oh, yes, we are
accepting the Government
research work very extensively.
McClellan: In the military
field?
Pitzer: We are accepting
unclassified research work very
extensively from the Defense
Department. We have about $17
million per year annual rate of
expenditure from the Defense
Department.
McClellan: I am not suggesting
this about your college or your
institution but this seems to be
one of the demands being made. I
am wondering if our institutions
and Government yield to that
demand, if then a further demand
will not be made and ultimately
we find that our Government can
not prepare to defend itself from
attack.
Pilzer: We are not yielding to
demands in this area, sir. We are
establishing what we think is the
best mutual policy between the
Federal Government and the
Universities, remembering that the
universities are primarily
educational institutions,
remembering, sir, as was said this
morning, that there is
dissatisfaction on the campus with
those who spend too much time
