AN OPEN LETTER TO
PRESIDENT PITZER AND
OTHER STANFORD
OFFICIALS:
Why do you say that "there is
a small, hard core of militant
radicals committed to the
destruction of . . . our
universities"? It just isn't true, is
it?
Surely there is a distinction to
be made between, on the one
hand, wanting to open up the
University to non-members of the
economic and cultural elite
(which seems to me to be exactly
what the Stanfords intended) or
to withdraw the University from
the arms race (to re-dedicate it to
Mrs. Stanford's "love of
humanity") or to eliminate the
factor of Charles (G.M.) Wilson's
utilitarianism from the calculus of
educational policy (of Mrs.
Stanford's dictum: "No one can
make a penny out of the
University") and even being
reckless of injury to the
University in the pursuit of such
ends and, on the other hand,
wanting to destroy the University.
The trouble with refusing to
make the distinction, however
easy a way of discrediting the
"radical" point of view that
refusal may be, is, from anyone's
point of view, the potential
boomerang effect. The danger in
saying that hard-core militants are
trying to destroy the University is
not only in signaling a
competition among reactionaries
for the privilege of uprooting the
same but is also, if it is said often
enough, in persuading the
so-called "hard-core" that such is
really what they are about. And if
that ever happens, the University
will not be worth much more than
the papers it is insured by.
I'm sure it adds a little
romance to the life of bored
administrators to believe that they
are struggling for the very
existence of the University, just as
it does to that of alienated
students to think that they are
dealing mortal blows to the racist,
imperialist monster, and it is good
that some are defending what is
defensible about the old order,
just as it is that some others are
refusing to tolerate what is
intolerable about it, but I think
that both factions would be more
successful in doing the latter, and
may avoid ultimate failure in
doing the former, if they would
get clear about which is which.
