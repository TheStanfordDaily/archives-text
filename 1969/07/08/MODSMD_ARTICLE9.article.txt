# 'In Circles' Opens Tonight
## 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Paris early in the century,
when Gertrude Stein held open
house for Picasso, Hemingway,
and a flock of American
expatriates is the setting for the
zany, nonsense musical "In
Circles."
The Stanford Summer Festival
will present the off-Broadway hit
based on Miss Stein's prose July
8-13 in Dinkelspiel Auditorium.
Performances are at 8 p.m.
nightly, with matinees at 2:30
p.m. July 12 and 13.
"In Circles" was first presented
in the 1967-68 New York season
by the famed Judson Poets

Theater. Critics praised the
musical for its sparkling
originality and the special
theatrical qualities of composer
Carmines' score.
Carmines will recreate his
starring role for the Stanford
presentation. Composer Carmines
has taken twelve pages of Miss
Stein's quirky prose and
transformed it into a gemlike
operetta of songs that vary from
popular numbers and" blues to
gospel songs and Beethoven.
Wit In Lyrics
The lyrics are permeated with
Miss Stein's sparkling and incisive
wit. Carmines is currently
represented off-Broadway with
the hit song and dance version of
Aristophanes' "Peace" and Marie
Irene Fornes' "Promenade." The
New York Post has called him
"The best living American
composer."
Carmines, an associate minister
at the Judson Memorial Church,
has built the Judson Poets'
Theater into an important part of
the New York theatrical scene.
Besides his clerical responsibilities,
he writes music, acts, teaches and
is a stage director and motion
picture critic. Carmines was
awarded the Obie for best music
in an off-Broadway production in
1964, and again in 1968 for "In
Circles."
"In Circles" could be described
as a circular play about a circle of
ten friends, sensitive soul who
inhabit a Paris garden. The ten are
by turns polite, bitchy, lecherous,
tender, gay, petulant, debonair,
boorish, clever, clumsy—swinging
from a troubled melancholy to a
mad euphoria, dancing like
Valentino, riposting like Clifton
Webb, brooding like Hamlet in a
tennis blazer.
Critical Acclaim
Jack Kroll of Newsweek has
said of "In Circles": "No one can
set a tautology and a nonsequitur
to music like Carmines and he
captures perfectly that quality
which makes Gertrude Stein
sound like a metaphysical Molly
Goldberg."
Clive Barnes, critic for The
New York Times, says: "Carmines
must eat music in the morning
instead of breakfast cereal, rather
as Gertrude Stein once must have
eaten words.
"His music is arrogantly
eclectic, disgracefully tuneful and
just right for the purpose ... 'In
C ircles' is the most sheerly
enjoyous pieces of purposeful
nonsense ever to hit New York."
