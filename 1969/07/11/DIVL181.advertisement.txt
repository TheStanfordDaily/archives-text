FILM SERlES—"Orange and Blue"—a visual journey through
a junk yard with two bouncing balls —one orange, and one
blue. It expressed many varying moods of childhood with
brilliant camera work.
"America —The Edge of Abundance" —a critical explora
tion of the far-reaching economic and social consequences
of our nation's increasingly automated and computer-oriented
society. The film was made by Rediusion Television, Ltd., in
London and gives us an outsider's look at the American pro
duction-consumption oriented society.
