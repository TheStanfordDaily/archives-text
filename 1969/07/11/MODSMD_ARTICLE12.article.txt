SES notes that "although some
considerable achievements took
place during the 1964-66 period, a
number of problems combined to
make the experience something
less than optimal."
SES knew the blow-by-blow
history of Wert's tenure as Dean
of Undergraduate Education,
because Robert Hind, staff
director of SES, worked under
Wert as Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education.
One problem cited by SES is
that Wert "had no real budgetary
leverage." SES has proposed an
independent budget of
unspecified size for the new Dean
of Undergraduate Studies.
SES has placed a good deal of
emphasis on the new Dean of
Undergraduate Studies as a leader
in curricular innovation. The SES
report on Undergraduate
Education proposed a number of
new interdisciplinary courses,
such as "Science and technology
for the non-specialist." The Dean
of Undergraduate Studies would
have special responsibility for
arranging such courses, in
cooperation with a new
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies of faculty and students.
