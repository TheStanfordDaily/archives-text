# Sponsored By A3M
## Black Panther Films Tonight 
### 
The April Third Movement will
sponsor an evening of films and
speakers to promote the United
Front against Fascism Conference,
called by the Black Panther Party
for July 18-20 in Oakland, tonight
at 7:30 in Cubberley.
Three films sent to Stanford by
the Panthers will be shown, and
information will be provided on
activities and plans for the
conference.
The Panthers are attempting at

present to develop a national
United Front against Fascism.
They feel that police repression
directed at them, together with
campus and congressional moves
against student activists and a
stepped-up effort to stop strikes,
all mark the beginning of a move
toward fascism in America.
Specifically, the Panthers have
called this conference "for any
individual and especially
representatives of all proletarian
type organizations or any group
or organization who stands against
fascism in America." At the
conference, those attending will
attempt to unite around a
program for community control
of police.
In A3M's program at
Cubberley tonight the first
speaker will be Roger Alvarado, a
Latino active in the strike at San
Francisco State who is now
working to build a defense and
politicai support for Los Siete de

la Raza, a group of seven Latinos
accused of killing a San Francisco
policeman.
Sister Roberta, who will also
speak, is from the Panther
National Office. Finally, there will
be a representative of the Young
Patriots, a group of white working
class people from uptown Chicago
who have recently allied with the
Panthers and a Puerto Rican
group.
The films, all from the
Panthers, will be Off the Pig,
Huey, and Prelude to Revolution.
Off the Pig is about the Panther
political program and some of the
early repression the Party faced,
and features an interview with
Eldridge Cleaver. Huey is an
account of a mass rally held in
Oakland just before Huey
Newton's trial. The film includes
speeches by Stokely Charmichael,
Rap Brown and Bobby Seale.
Prelude to Revolution is a half
hour interview with Huey in jail,
in which he lays out his political
philosophy.
A donation of $1 will be asked
to help pay the costs of printing
publicity material for the
conference. Conference
registration forms will be
available.
