## Apocalypse At Fillmore 
### DAVE STEVENS 
I don't know; maybe I've just been thinking
about Cleaver's statement from Cuba too much, and
carrying my feelings about life in Babylon to
extremes. At one point in last Thursday's rock
concert at the Fillmore West, I became nauseated by
my surroundings. That was in the middle of Rockin'
Foo's second overlong set (the less said about it, the
better), during which an angry fistfight erupted
right in front of the stage. The high-school kid in
front of me was trying to like Rockin' Foo too
much, and kept trying to get me to share his joint.
Hippy shmippy. I almost punched him in the
mouth.
I can't really blame the music, though. We've
come to regard the third-billed band as part of the
admission price: $3.50 plus Rockin' Foo to hear
Lonnie Mack and Johnny Winter.
Lonnie Mack is something of a rock and roll
legend, a first-rate rock guitarist; influenced both by
the Chicago-Memphis blues tradition and by the
early rockers of the '50's, notably Chuck Berry.
Add to that John Sebastian's description of the
Nashville Cats, "plays clean as country water," and
you have a pretty good definition of where Lonnie
Mack, and where rock as a form in its own right, are
at.
Lonnie Mack: Rediscovered Texas
Mack has had only one hit, an instrumental
versions of "Memphis" back in 1963. His first
albums on the Fraternity label are long out of print,
but Elektra recently rediscovered him in Texas, and
has released a new Lonnie Mack record. This one
includes "Memphis," the only instrumental, and ten
vocals, augmented by nifty horn arrangements.
Except for the absence of horns (Mack fronts a
trip), the record is a pretty fair indication of Mack's
live performances: concise and well-fashioned guitar
solos, comfortable, powerful singing, good songs
anchored in Mack's country-blues tradition, and
above all, a feeling of a personality behind the
music.
There are no twenty-minute ego trips a la Blue
Cheer, no vocal hysterics a la Led Zeppelin no
pompous "classical" approaches to Motown tunes a
la Vanilla Fudge, no Bloomfieldian kissing of 8.8.
King's behind. Only in his final number "Where
There's a Will There's a Way," did Mack stretch out,
in a mock-James Brown tearjerker style, one of
those call-and-response I'm down beggin' on my
knees things. But it was no mere James Brown
imitator who finally laughed and sang to us: "What
the hell am I doing down here on my knees?" Nor
was he a mere jokester: the final guitar chorus
brought us to our feet yelling for more.
Then there was Johnny Winter, looking and
playing like the walking death. Winter is another
recent discovery, signed by good old superhip

Columbia Records to an unprecedented $300,000
bonus. It started with an item in Rolling Stone, the
rock trade journal, that somewhere in Texas existed
a great albino blues guitarist, name of Johnny
Winter. Columbia's reasoning isn't too hard to
follow. All the elements of success are there: the
mystery of an unknown from the bush country,
money, a big-hype, the freak-image in Winter's
epidermis-better, even, than Reprise's psychedelic
black man, Jimi Hendrix- and, almost incidentally, a
great guitar player in the age of the guitar.
Somewhat Unfair To Winter
It's all a shame, and besides somewhat unfair to
Winter, because he plays like a powerhouse, and,
judging from his in-person demeanor and the
interviews he's given, he doesn't give a hoot about
freaky images. And gauged by the fact that his
albums haven't exactly removed Hendrix from the
top, neither does his audience. It's ultimately the
music that counts, the real person behind the music,
not the promotion.
Like Mike Bloomfield, Winter is deeply
committed to the blues, in this case to the Delta
tradition of Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. But
unlike Bloomfield, he is able to transcend
categories, although you can't tell this by his
albums. The man is electricity incarnate, playing at
tremendous volumes, but not resorting to free-form
noise making. Like Lonnie Mack, Winter is
synthesizing, not imitating—there's a sense that the
Delta blues are being translated into Johnny
Winter's blues, a blues suited to a world of big
money, methredine, and the promotion of albinos
as a new best-selling commodity.
This isn't to say that there aren't problems with
Winter's music, for there are: his attempts at BB's
numbers are abrasively ugly. Winter's guitar simply
cannot gently weep; when he's in his own bag, his
guitar screams. And by and large, that's where
Winter was at that night, making for one of the
most exciting listening experiences I've had at the
Fillmore. And it makes you realize how far it's all
come from the country-clean days of Lonnie Mack,
let alone Chuck Berry or Muddy Waters.
It struck me as something like the apogee of a
speed run; keep in mind that the Fillmore West is
being taken over by Howard Johnson's Motor
Lodges this December. Howard Johnson! Winter's
performance was an apocalypse. That's why on the
drive home, in keeping with the spirit of the
excesses of Columbia Records, Rockin' Foo,
Howard Johnson's twenty-eight flavors, and Bill
Graham, it occurred to me that the really fitting end
to all of us there that night was right out of a
Japanese horror movie. The walls of Babylon West
should have come tumbling down, and stoned and
screaming, we should all have been devoured by a
giant smiling bright green frog.

It's all a shame, and besides somewhat unfair to
Winter, because he plays like a powerhouse, and,
judging from his in-person demeanor and the
interviews he's given, he doesn't give a hoot about
freaky images. And gauged by the fact that his
albums haven't exactly removed Hendrix from the
top, neither does his audience. It's ultimately the
music that counts, the real person behind the music,
not the promotion.
Like Mike Bloomfield, Winter is deeply
committed to the blues, in this case to the Delta
tradition of Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. But
unlike Bloomfield, he is able to transcend
categories, although you can't tell this by his
albums. The man is electricity incarnate, playing at
tremendous volumes, but not resorting to free-form
noise making. Like Lonnie Mack, Winter is
synthesizing, not imitating—there's a sense that the
Delta blues are being translated into Johnny
Winter's blues, a blues suited to a world of big
money, methredine, and the promotion of albinos
as a new best-selling commodity.
This isn't to say that there aren't problems with
Winter's music, for there are: his attempts at BB's
numbers are abrasively ugly. Winter's guitar simply
cannot gently weep; when he's in his own bag, his
guitar screams. And by and large, that's where
Winter was at that night, making for one of the
most exciting listening experiences I've had at the
Fillmore. And it makes you realize how far it's all
come from the country-clean days of Lonnie Mack,
let alone Chuck Berry or Muddy Waters.
It struck me as something like the apogee of a
speed run; keep in mind that the Fillmore West is
being taken over by Howard Johnson's Motor
Lodges this December. Howard Johnson! Winter's
performance was an apocalypse. That's why on the
drive home, in keeping with the spirit of the
excesses of Columbia Records, Rockin' Foo,
Howard Johnson's twenty-eight flavors, and Bill
Graham, it occurred to me that the really fitting end
to all of us there that night was right out of a
Japanese horror movie. The walls of Babylon West
should have come tumbling down, and stoned and
screaming, we should all have been devoured by a
giant smiling bright green frog.
I don't know; maybe I've just been thinking
about Cleaver's statement from Cuba too much, and
carrying my feelings about life in Babylon to
extremes. At one point in last Thursday's rock
concert at the Fillmore West, I became nauseated by
my surroundings. That was in the middle of Rockin'
Foo's second overlong set (the less said about it, the
better), during which an angry fistfight erupted
right in front of the stage. The high-school kid in
front of me was trying to like Rockin' Foo too
much, and kept trying to get me to share his joint.
Hippy shmippy. I almost punched him in the
mouth.
I can't really blame the music, though. We've
come to regard the third-billed band as part of the
admission price: $3.50 plus Rockin' Foo to hear
Lonnie Mack and Johnny Winter.
Lonnie Mack is something of a rock and roll
legend, a first-rate rock guitarist; influenced both by
the Chicago-Memphis blues tradition and by the
early rockers of the '50's, notably Chuck Berry.
Add to that John Sebastian's description of the
Nashville Cats, "plays clean as country water," and
you have a pretty good definition of where Lonnie
Mack, and where rock as a form in its own right, are
at.
Lonnie Mack: Rediscovered Texas
Mack has had only one hit, an instrumental
versions of "Memphis" back in 1963. His first
albums on the Fraternity label are long out of print,
but Elektra recently rediscovered him in Texas, and
has released a new Lonnie Mack record. This one
includes "Memphis," the only instrumental, and ten
vocals, augmented by nifty horn arrangements.
Except for the absence of horns (Mack fronts a
trip), the record is a pretty fair indication of Mack's
live performances: concise and well-fashioned guitar
solos, comfortable, powerful singing, good songs
anchored in Mack's country-blues tradition, and
above all, a feeling of a personality behind the
music.
There are no twenty-minute ego trips a la Blue
Cheer, no vocal hysterics a la Led Zeppelin no
pompous "classical" approaches to Motown tunes a
la Vanilla Fudge, no Bloomfieldian kissing of 8.8.
King's behind. Only in his final number "Where
There's a Will There's a Way," did Mack stretch out,
in a mock-James Brown tearjerker style, one of
those call-and-response I'm down beggin' on my
knees things. But it was no mere James Brown
imitator who finally laughed and sang to us: "What
the hell am I doing down here on my knees?" Nor
was he a mere jokester: the final guitar chorus
brought us to our feet yelling for more.
Then there was Johnny Winter, looking and
playing like the walking death. Winter is another
recent discovery, signed by good old superhip

Columbia Records to an unprecedented $300,000
bonus. It started with an item in Rolling Stone, the
rock trade journal, that somewhere in Texas existed
a great albino blues guitarist, name of Johnny
Winter. Columbia's reasoning isn't too hard to
follow. All the elements of success are there: the
mystery of an unknown from the bush country,
money, a big-hype, the freak-image in Winter's
epidermis-better, even, than Reprise's psychedelic
black man, Jimi Hendrix- and, almost incidentally, a
great guitar player in the age of the guitar.

you have a pretty good definition of where Lonnie
Mack, and where rock as a form in its own right, are
at.
Lonnie Mack: Rediscovered Texas
Mack has had only one hit, an instrumental
versions of "Memphis" back in 1963. His first
albums on the Fraternity label are long out of print,
but Elektra recently rediscovered him in Texas, and
has released a new Lonnie Mack record. This one
includes "Memphis," the only instrumental, and ten
vocals, augmented by nifty horn arrangements.
Except for the absence of horns (Mack fronts a
trip), the record is a pretty fair indication of Mack's
live performances: concise and well-fashioned guitar
solos, comfortable, powerful singing, good songs
anchored in Mack's country-blues tradition, and
above all, a feeling of a personality behind the
music.
There are no twenty-minute ego trips a la Blue
Cheer, no vocal hysterics a la Led Zeppelin no
pompous "classical" approaches to Motown tunes a
la Vanilla Fudge, no Bloomfieldian kissing of 8.8.
King's behind. Only in his final number "Where
There's a Will There's a Way," did Mack stretch out,
in a mock-James Brown tearjerker style, one of
those call-and-response I'm down beggin' on my
knees things. But it was no mere James Brown
imitator who finally laughed and sang to us: "What
the hell am I doing down here on my knees?" Nor
was he a mere jokester: the final guitar chorus
brought us to our feet yelling for more.
Then there was Johnny Winter, looking and
playing like the walking death. Winter is another
recent discovery, signed by good old superhip

Columbia Records to an unprecedented $300,000
bonus. It started with an item in Rolling Stone, the
rock trade journal, that somewhere in Texas existed
a great albino blues guitarist, name of Johnny
Winter. Columbia's reasoning isn't too hard to
follow. All the elements of success are there: the
mystery of an unknown from the bush country,
money, a big-hype, the freak-image in Winter's
epidermis-better, even, than Reprise's psychedelic
black man, Jimi Hendrix- and, almost incidentally, a
great guitar player in the age of the guitar.
Somewhat Unfair To Winter
It's all a shame, and besides somewhat unfair to
Winter, because he plays like a powerhouse, and,
judging from his in-person demeanor and the
interviews he's given, he doesn't give a hoot about
freaky images. And gauged by the fact that his
albums haven't exactly removed Hendrix from the
top, neither does his audience. It's ultimately the
music that counts, the real person behind the music,
not the promotion.
Like Mike Bloomfield, Winter is deeply
committed to the blues, in this case to the Delta
tradition of Robert Johnson and Muddy Waters. But
unlike Bloomfield, he is able to transcend
categories, although you can't tell this by his
albums. The man is electricity incarnate, playing at
tremendous volumes, but not resorting to free-form
noise making. Like Lonnie Mack, Winter is
synthesizing, not imitating—there's a sense that the
Delta blues are being translated into Johnny
Winter's blues, a blues suited to a world of big
money, methredine, and the promotion of albinos
as a new best-selling commodity.
This isn't to say that there aren't problems with
Winter's music, for there are: his attempts at BB's
numbers are abrasively ugly. Winter's guitar simply
cannot gently weep; when he's in his own bag, his
guitar screams. And by and large, that's where
Winter was at that night, making for one of the
most exciting listening experiences I've had at the
Fillmore. And it makes you realize how far it's all
come from the country-clean days of Lonnie Mack,
let alone Chuck Berry or Muddy Waters.
It struck me as something like the apogee of a
speed run; keep in mind that the Fillmore West is
being taken over by Howard Johnson's Motor
Lodges this December. Howard Johnson! Winter's
performance was an apocalypse. That's why on the
drive home, in keeping with the spirit of the
excesses of Columbia Records, Rockin' Foo,
Howard Johnson's twenty-eight flavors, and Bill
Graham, it occurred to me that the really fitting end
to all of us there that night was right out of a
Japanese horror movie. The walls of Babylon West
should have come tumbling down, and stoned and
screaming, we should all have been devoured by a
giant smiling bright green frog.
I don't know; maybe I've just been thinking
about Cleaver's statement from Cuba too much, and
carrying my feelings about life in Babylon to
extremes. At one point in last Thursday's rock
concert at the Fillmore West, I became nauseated by
my surroundings. That was in the middle of Rockin'
Foo's second overlong set (the less said about it, the
better), during which an angry fistfight erupted
right in front of the stage. The high-school kid in
front of me was trying to like Rockin' Foo too
much, and kept trying to get me to share his joint.
Hippy shmippy. I almost punched him in the
mouth.
I can't really blame the music, though. We've
come to regard the third-billed band as part of the
admission price: $3.50 plus Rockin' Foo to hear
Lonnie Mack and Johnny Winter.
Lonnie Mack is something of a rock and roll
legend, a first-rate rock guitarist; influenced both by
the Chicago-Memphis blues tradition and by the
early rockers of the '50's, notably Chuck Berry.
