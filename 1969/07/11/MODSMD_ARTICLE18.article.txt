# Sounds Like Summer
## 'Terpsichore Unchain'd' 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
The New York Pro Musica
brought the diversions of royalty
to Memorial Auditorium
Wednesday evening, with its
production of "An Entertainment
for Elizabeth." The music, dances
and poetry of the Late
Renaissance were presented in the
form of a masque before the
Queen, "not Opera or Play, but
Allegorical Ballet, Which
overflows its Stage when the end
shows a Truth to apprehend."
The Queen and her Court
participate with the players on
stage, while the audience looks on
through a one-way glass of time.
A Masque is "no Play, but nobles
at their Playing"; as such,
"Elizabeth" can give us a closer
glimpse of what that age stood
for.
Touchstone of the piece is
clearly Variety, the fine bass in a
cloak of a thousand colorful
snatches. He advocates whimsey,
anarchy, and disregard of
convention in music, dance,
poetry and costume; change
should govern life. "Uniformity is
like a tomb," he intones; all
giggle, and then go back to their
structured tunes, codified dances,
formalized entertainment.
Variety's cloak is torn away,
revealing beneath the motley
undergarb of Chance, and he
admits to wanting change because
he is tired of what he has, not
because change would necessarily
be better. The original wild-eyed
liberal.
He is juxtaposed to the smiling,
silent Queen, for whom retention
of the order is everything.
Nothing, but nothing, is left to
chance for her, and she acts (as I
suppose autocrats do act)
completely assured that all will
transpire as she deigns.
History tends to remember
conservatives, probably because
conservatives remember
conservatives, while liberals see
old liberals as stodgy, and
therefore see no reason to
remember them. (Where is
Herbert Humphries those days?) It
is said that a conservative is a man
who can be counted upon to
perpetuate the errors of his
ancestors, and this is wliat Variety
is up against.
He neither screams nor cheers,
but constantly argues for breaking
out of the straitjacket of rules
that he himself subscribes to:
"Curses on all this order, then,"
but again, no one listens. The
Queen chooses to dance with
Mars, "who is Right, which
rhymes with Might." Variety gets
applause from our audience, but
not from the Queen. Why, then, is
he in the Masque?
Variety reminds the
Elizabethan audience that order
is, in fact, good, that change is not
only unnecessary, it is downright
foolhardy. Variety can be

attacked in that age, as he is now,
of demanding change, but making
no guidelines to preserve that
change.
What we fail to realize,
however, is that Variety doesn't
want his rules to be the rules
either. "All proportion will be
overthrown, and chance again will
re-assume his throne," he says,
while all are hushed. Is this a
threat to the Order, seated before
us?
It could be, but it isn't. Variety
is a fool, although a very clever
one. He was useful to the times,
for he served as proof of the
rightness of that order. Variety
plays again today, but now he
refuses to sing in tune and dance
in step. Today he strips off his
clothes and berates the order; and
again, as before, the nervous
giggles preceed bored and ignoring
glances.
But as the Masque closes, as
the Court and dances fade into
the Grotto, they whisper "And
beauty all shall pass, Like shadows
on the grass." Yes, this order too
shall pass, but it shall be another
order which takes its place, not
the absence of order. So has it
always been, and so, it seems,
shall it always be.
The truth which "overflows
the stage" would be nothing if the
costumes, singing, dancing and
musicianship were not capable of
carrying the message to this
modern-day, skeptical audience. I
found the timing a bit weak in
places, which affected the
continuity, and some of the
dialogue was forced and affected,
even for a Masque.
But the regular eleven or
twelve members of the New York
Pro Musica were superb,
undoubtedly better than the

Court musicians of the age they
represent. Krummhorns and
cornetti are not just odd to look
at and difficult to explain (I
overheard one father describe the
bass recorder to his young son as a
"saxaphone"), but they are
equally demanding as instruments.
I have the feeling that
Renaissance nobles were not
especially particular about the
intonation of their musicians, or
else shawms and sackbuts would
have soon become extinct. They
still survive, however, largely
because of groups such as the New
York Pro Musica and their
counterparts in other nations,
which have been formed for the
purpose of preserving interest in
Medieval, Renaissance and
Baroque music.
Re-creations such as
"Elizabeth" and the Pro Musica's
other such productions, "The Play
of Daniel" and"The Play of
Herod," help to bring this early
music back to life in the context
in which it matured. Students of
history and literature should be as
interested in these performances
as are friends of music.
Dancing was a large part of the
playing of the nobies, and the
frank annals contemporary with
Renaissance rulers make careful
note of the agility of the noble on
the ballroom floor. Dancing the
galliard may be the most
excrutiating exercize Satan ever
invented, as I am sure Prof.
Houle's students will attest, but
the dancers in the company made
it and other dances seem the
easiest of steps. The choreography
was done by Julia Sutton, and is
an accurate and fairly complete
repertory of the Elizabethan
Court dances.
Adding flourish to the Masque

were the splendid costumes,
researched and designed by Anne
Hollander. They made the Masque
an exciting, living glimpse into the
past, not a stale story of times
long past and without meaning.
Clothing played an important role
in Court life, and I was pleased to
see this aspect of society so well
represented.
"An Entertainment for
Elizabeth" blends the sound and
color and movement of Late
Reniassance royal life into "A
Most Excellent Princely Maske of
the Seven Motions," a program of
gaiety and splendor, a thoughly
enjoyable production.
The Pro Musica repeats this
Masque tonight and tomorrow
night, with two traditional
concerts next week. Another
intriguing view of royal life can be
found in W. H. Lewis' absorbing
book, "The Splendid Century."
