## A 						Play Is A Play Is A... 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
Who is Gertrude Stein? A Neopolitan Noble is a Neapolitan Noble.
Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein. A. Carmines is A. Carmines is A.
Carmines.
What is "In Circles"? "In Circles" is a play based on the poems of
Gertrude Stein. And you know who Gertrude Stein is.
What is "In Circles"? "In Circles" is a vehicle for A 1 Carmines. It is a
cabriolet, and A 1 Carmines is chief cabrioleteer.
Is it necessary to write a circular review of a circular play? "In
Circles" is a circular play. It goes round and round, in circles, goes "In
Circles."
Enough, enough. No, it is not necessary to write a circular review
about a circular play; thank goodness, because I'm not A 1 Carmines,
and I can't drive a cabriolet (at least, I don't think I can).
Circular Musical Nonsense (Maybe)?
But how, how does one describe "In Cirlces," the circular musical
non-play nonsense that opened, opened up, at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this week? How can you describe eighty minutes of Gertrude Stein, as
processed by A 1 Carmines? Can you imagine the verses of Lewis Carroll
being arranged by Ogden Nash, and set to music by Tom Lehrer?
Can you imagine an encounter group run amok, in which the entire
group communicates in pidgin, and there you are, observing, knowing
that they understand each other, but hearing only little like "Get
a street," and "Is round, around, my apple." And it means something,
to them; to you too, sort of. But what does it mean? Whose apple?
What street? What? What?
Oh, "In Circles" is different. You know it's different as soon as you
walk into Dinkelspiel and you notice that for the first time in history
Dink is actually pretty. You see that beautiful garden s°t 01 Barry
Arnold, with the fountain and the sunken piano, and you know that
things have changed in some subtle way.
Then A 1 Carmines comes out dressed like a stage hand, sits down at
the piano, and starts to play just terribly. The cast drifts in slowly, and
suddenly the fountain stops and they break into the opening song:
variations and fugue on "Poppa dozes, momma blows her noses."
Eighty Minutes of Potential Disaster
And it goes on like that, for eighty minutes. Nonsense. Potentially
the most boring and disasterous way to try to entertain, but that eighty
minutes passes fast. I don't know why I liked it. I shouldn't have. But I
did, I did.
Sometimes I did get bored, but then something would happen that
almost made sense, that suggested a plot, or at least a story, or maybe a
hint of character development, and I was back in their grasp, in that
strange, 1924 Paris garden, with pseudo-Hemingways and
quasi-Fitsgeralds.
The Lost Generation. What a name for a singing group. What a group.
There are nine of them in addition to the Master, four men and five
women, and all, and each, are splendid, in some circular way.
Arlene Rothlein dances a la Isadora Duncan, Arthur Williams pouts,
Elain Summers is tall and nice, George Bartenieff comes in late, and
strong, Nancy Zala sings beautifully, George McGrath has a big
moustache, and Lee Crespi is very, very pretty.
Eight-And-One-Half Months Pregnant
Theo Barnes stands apart from the others, with a strong voice and a
tortured soul. And Crystal Field has the truest circle, because Crystal,
bless her, is eight and one-half months pregnant, and if you catch the
right performance you could witness the first childbirth in Dinkelspiel's
history (Mazeltov, Crystal!). They all work under the direction of
Lawrence Kornfeld, who takes much of the credit for making "In
Circles" work, when by all the laws of man and God it should not.
And then there is A 1 Carmines. You should go just to see Al
Carmines. If you don't like nonsense or Gertrude Stein, or Dinkelspiel,
go to see Al Carmines. Go to an evening performance, because in the
evenings the Reverend Carmines (Really! B.D. and S.T.M. from the
Union Theological Seminary, and associate minister at the Judson
Memorial Church.) returns after the intermission and gives a one-man
rendition of his theater music, music that has earned him two OBIE's.
He is phenomenal. Besides setting Getrude Stein to music, he has
also had for "his lyricists," the Bible, Aristophanes, and Chairman Mao
Tse-Tung. His melodies are charming and his delivery is superb. His
lyrics (his own) are witty, and penetrating. He has soul (as becomes a
minister). He must give some socko sermons. A true artist, a fine
entertainer.
Bravo Al Carmines. Bravo Judson Poets Theater, and Lawrence
Kornfeld, too. Bravo Gertrude Stein. A hit is a hit is a hit.

There are nine of them in addition to the Master, four men and five
women, and all, and each, are splendid, in some circular way.
Arlene Rothlein dances a la Isadora Duncan, Arthur Williams pouts,
Elain Summers is tall and nice, George Bartenieff comes in late, and
strong, Nancy Zala sings beautifully, George McGrath has a big
moustache, and Lee Crespi is very, very pretty.
Eight-And-One-Half Months Pregnant
Theo Barnes stands apart from the others, with a strong voice and a
tortured soul. And Crystal Field has the truest circle, because Crystal,
bless her, is eight and one-half months pregnant, and if you catch the
right performance you could witness the first childbirth in Dinkelspiel's
history (Mazeltov, Crystal!). They all work under the direction of
Lawrence Kornfeld, who takes much of the credit for making "In
Circles" work, when by all the laws of man and God it should not.
And then there is A 1 Carmines. You should go just to see Al
Carmines. If you don't like nonsense or Gertrude Stein, or Dinkelspiel,
go to see Al Carmines. Go to an evening performance, because in the
evenings the Reverend Carmines (Really! B.D. and S.T.M. from the
Union Theological Seminary, and associate minister at the Judson
Memorial Church.) returns after the intermission and gives a one-man
rendition of his theater music, music that has earned him two OBIE's.
He is phenomenal. Besides setting Getrude Stein to music, he has
also had for "his lyricists," the Bible, Aristophanes, and Chairman Mao
Tse-Tung. His melodies are charming and his delivery is superb. His
lyrics (his own) are witty, and penetrating. He has soul (as becomes a
minister). He must give some socko sermons. A true artist, a fine
entertainer.
Bravo Al Carmines. Bravo Judson Poets Theater, and Lawrence
Kornfeld, too. Bravo Gertrude Stein. A hit is a hit is a hit.


Thou liarnes and Al Carmines in Gertrude Stein's "In Circles."
Who is Gertrude Stein? A Neopolitan Noble is a Neapolitan Noble.
Gertrude Stein is Gertrude Stein. A. Carmines is A. Carmines is A.
Carmines.
What is "In Circles"? "In Circles" is a play based on the poems of
Gertrude Stein. And you know who Gertrude Stein is.
What is "In Circles"? "In Circles" is a vehicle for A 1 Carmines. It is a
cabriolet, and A 1 Carmines is chief cabrioleteer.
Is it necessary to write a circular review of a circular play? "In
Circles" is a circular play. It goes round and round, in circles, goes "In
Circles."
Enough, enough. No, it is not necessary to write a circular review
about a circular play; thank goodness, because I'm not A 1 Carmines,
and I can't drive a cabriolet (at least, I don't think I can).
Circular Musical Nonsense (Maybe)?
But how, how does one describe "In Cirlces," the circular musical
non-play nonsense that opened, opened up, at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this week? How can you describe eighty minutes of Gertrude Stein, as
processed by A 1 Carmines? Can you imagine the verses of Lewis Carroll
being arranged by Ogden Nash, and set to music by Tom Lehrer?
Can you imagine an encounter group run amok, in which the entire
group communicates in pidgin, and there you are, observing, knowing
that they understand each other, but hearing only little like "Get
a street," and "Is round, around, my apple." And it means something,
to them; to you too, sort of. But what does it mean? Whose apple?
What street? What? What?
Oh, "In Circles" is different. You know it's different as soon as you
walk into Dinkelspiel and you notice that for the first time in history
Dink is actually pretty. You see that beautiful garden s°t 01 Barry
Arnold, with the fountain and the sunken piano, and you know that
things have changed in some subtle way.
Then A 1 Carmines comes out dressed like a stage hand, sits down at
the piano, and starts to play just terribly. The cast drifts in slowly, and
suddenly the fountain stops and they break into the opening song:
variations and fugue on "Poppa dozes, momma blows her noses."
Eighty Minutes of Potential Disaster
And it goes on like that, for eighty minutes. Nonsense. Potentially
the most boring and disasterous way to try to entertain, but that eighty
minutes passes fast. I don't know why I liked it. I shouldn't have. But I
did, I did.
Sometimes I did get bored, but then something would happen that
almost made sense, that suggested a plot, or at least a story, or maybe a
hint of character development, and I was back in their grasp, in that
strange, 1924 Paris garden, with pseudo-Hemingways and
quasi-Fitsgeralds.

But how, how does one describe "In Cirlces," the circular musical
non-play nonsense that opened, opened up, at Dinkelspiel Auditorium
this week? How can you describe eighty minutes of Gertrude Stein, as
processed by A 1 Carmines? Can you imagine the verses of Lewis Carroll
being arranged by Ogden Nash, and set to music by Tom Lehrer?
Can you imagine an encounter group run amok, in which the entire
group communicates in pidgin, and there you are, observing, knowing
that they understand each other, but hearing only little like "Get
a street," and "Is round, around, my apple." And it means something,
to them; to you too, sort of. But what does it mean? Whose apple?
What street? What? What?
Oh, "In Circles" is different. You know it's different as soon as you
walk into Dinkelspiel and you notice that for the first time in history
Dink is actually pretty. You see that beautiful garden s°t 01 Barry
Arnold, with the fountain and the sunken piano, and you know that
things have changed in some subtle way.
Then A 1 Carmines comes out dressed like a stage hand, sits down at
the piano, and starts to play just terribly. The cast drifts in slowly, and
suddenly the fountain stops and they break into the opening song:
variations and fugue on "Poppa dozes, momma blows her noses."
Eighty Minutes of Potential Disaster
And it goes on like that, for eighty minutes. Nonsense. Potentially
the most boring and disasterous way to try to entertain, but that eighty
minutes passes fast. I don't know why I liked it. I shouldn't have. But I
did, I did.
Sometimes I did get bored, but then something would happen that
almost made sense, that suggested a plot, or at least a story, or maybe a
hint of character development, and I was back in their grasp, in that
strange, 1924 Paris garden, with pseudo-Hemingways and
quasi-Fitsgeralds.
The Lost Generation. What a name for a singing group. What a group.
There are nine of them in addition to the Master, four men and five
women, and all, and each, are splendid, in some circular way.
Arlene Rothlein dances a la Isadora Duncan, Arthur Williams pouts,
Elain Summers is tall and nice, George Bartenieff comes in late, and
strong, Nancy Zala sings beautifully, George McGrath has a big
moustache, and Lee Crespi is very, very pretty.
Eight-And-One-Half Months Pregnant
Theo Barnes stands apart from the others, with a strong voice and a
tortured soul. And Crystal Field has the truest circle, because Crystal,
bless her, is eight and one-half months pregnant, and if you catch the
right performance you could witness the first childbirth in Dinkelspiel's
history (Mazeltov, Crystal!). They all work under the direction of
Lawrence Kornfeld, who takes much of the credit for making "In
Circles" work, when by all the laws of man and God it should not.
And then there is A 1 Carmines. You should go just to see Al
Carmines. If you don't like nonsense or Gertrude Stein, or Dinkelspiel,
go to see Al Carmines. Go to an evening performance, because in the
evenings the Reverend Carmines (Really! B.D. and S.T.M. from the
Union Theological Seminary, and associate minister at the Judson
Memorial Church.) returns after the intermission and gives a one-man
rendition of his theater music, music that has earned him two OBIE's.
He is phenomenal. Besides setting Getrude Stein to music, he has
also had for "his lyricists," the Bible, Aristophanes, and Chairman Mao
Tse-Tung. His melodies are charming and his delivery is superb. His
lyrics (his own) are witty, and penetrating. He has soul (as becomes a
minister). He must give some socko sermons. A true artist, a fine
entertainer.
Bravo Al Carmines. Bravo Judson Poets Theater, and Lawrence
Kornfeld, too. Bravo Gertrude Stein. A hit is a hit is a hit.


Thou liarnes and Al Carmines in Gertrude Stein's "In Circles."
