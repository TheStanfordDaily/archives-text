# Law School Study Reveals Jury Bias
## 
### 
California juries are influenced
by the economic status of
defendants in reaching
life-and-death decisions in
first-degree murder cases, a new
study by five Stanford Law
School students shows.
Published as a special issue of
The Stanford Law Review, the
study raises serious questions
about the constitutionality of the
present system of administering
capital punishment in California
and 38 other states which follow
the practice of "standardless
sentencing." This practice gives
juries complete discretion on
whether to sentence those guilty
of first-degree murder to death or
life imprisonment.
The Stanford study also shows
a strong, positive relationship
between the introduction of a
defendant's past criminal record
in the penalty trial and its
outcome. But when this and other
factors, including occupational
status, were taken into account,
there was no evidence of racial
discrimination by the juries in
these cases.
Financed by a $15,000 grant
from the Walter E. Meyer
Research Institute of Law, the
two-year study covered 238
first-degree murder penalty
decisions in California from 1958
through 1966. This total included
all those cases where the life or
death penalty was determined by

a jury.
Related to Pending Case
The study's findings are
directly related to a case now
pending before the U.S. Supreme
Court—Maxwell vs Bishop—which
could invalidate "standardless
sentencing" procedures now used
in 39 of the 41 states which retain
capital punishment. The Court
was unable to reach a decision in
this case during the last term and
has scheduled it for re-argument
this fall.
The present system of
"standardless sentencing" is
unconstitutional, the students
suggest, "because one crucial
basis—defendant's occupational
status—is assigned independent
significance by the jury in making
their penalty determination." This
violates the constitutional
provisions for equal protection
under the laws, and may deny due
process as well.
"In light of this and other
specific findings . . . the California
Legislature would be well advised
to restructure the present system
of allowing juries to determine
penalty without standards in
first-degree murder cases," the
students declare.
Methods Suggested
The students suggest several
ways in which this could be done.
One would be to enact a binding
system of aggravating and
