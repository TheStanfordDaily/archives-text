•Old Union Happening
Shaving cream covered kisses, screaming poetry from treetops, and
disrobing to swim and writhe in the Old Union courtyard's
fountain—more than 500 people were involved Monday night in the
happening sponsored by the Stanford Far-Out Theater Workshop. It
started at the Nitery with music, drums, incense, body painting, beer,
and spiked watermelon and flowed outdoors to include the fountain,
trees, passers-by, balconies, roofs, and stars.
People found fresh pineapple floating in the fountain, raced
motorcycles, danced with candles and flashlights, and threw toilet
paper rolls. They clustered together and moved so that they looked like
the insides of machines, and made machine sounds and blew smoke.
Children and animals did their usual thing.
Robert Aguelar's ritual party, "Lindsay Osborne," was performed
afterward by five actors from San Francisco State College. The entire
evening was a warm-up for the Far-Out Theater Workshop's
performances of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," which begins July 30.
•PBL Again
KQED (Channel 9) will rebroadcast the Public Broadcasting
Laboratory's hour-long look at activists at Stanford, "University in
Society: Do Ties Bind," Sunday night at 10 p.m. The film was made by
a PBL crew who were at Stanford for several weeks last winter quarter.
The first portion of the documentary, "Reform Before Revolution,"
traces efforts of the faculty and administration to stem the tides of
dissent by adapting to changing conditions. The second segment,
"Fathers and Sons," shows members of SDS and other radical students
staging a confrontation and preparing to challenge the University.
•Draft Counseling

Service as twelve months, there may be special circumstances in which a
local board will require certification of summer enrollment at Stanford.
Such certification, when requested by the student concerned, will be
provided by the Office of Special Services, a section of the Office of the
Dean of Students.

isolated youth and aged will be confronted by living in the inner city
area and talking with persons directly involved.
The weekend will begin early Friday afternoon and continue
through Sunday morning. The cost will be approximately $15.00.

•Old Union Happening
Shaving cream covered kisses, screaming poetry from treetops, and
disrobing to swim and writhe in the Old Union courtyard's
fountain—more than 500 people were involved Monday night in the
happening sponsored by the Stanford Far-Out Theater Workshop. It
started at the Nitery with music, drums, incense, body painting, beer,
and spiked watermelon and flowed outdoors to include the fountain,
trees, passers-by, balconies, roofs, and stars.
People found fresh pineapple floating in the fountain, raced
motorcycles, danced with candles and flashlights, and threw toilet
paper rolls. They clustered together and moved so that they looked like
the insides of machines, and made machine sounds and blew smoke.
Children and animals did their usual thing.
Robert Aguelar's ritual party, "Lindsay Osborne," was performed
afterward by five actors from San Francisco State College. The entire
evening was a warm-up for the Far-Out Theater Workshop's
performances of Thornton Wilder's "Our Town," which begins July 30.
•PBL Again
KQED (Channel 9) will rebroadcast the Public Broadcasting
Laboratory's hour-long look at activists at Stanford, "University in
Society: Do Ties Bind," Sunday night at 10 p.m. The film was made by
a PBL crew who were at Stanford for several weeks last winter quarter.
The first portion of the documentary, "Reform Before Revolution,"
traces efforts of the faculty and administration to stem the tides of
dissent by adapting to changing conditions. The second segment,
"Fathers and Sons," shows members of SDS and other radical students
staging a confrontation and preparing to challenge the University.

Dean of Students.
The Office of Special Services provides counseling and information
about a wide range of problems and questions relating to the draft.
Students seeking assistance in such matters should go in person to
Room 324, Old Union, or call extension 3381.
