# SES Plan Before Senate
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The warm lethargy of summer
will be stirred up a bit when the
Academic Senate considers the
controversial proposal for a new
Dean of Undergraduate Studies at
its next meeting, July 24.
Many faculty and students
regard the proposal for the new
Dean as one of the most
important recommendations of
the Study of Education at

Stanford (SES), which worked for
two years and came up with
hundreds of ideas for reform.
SES said the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would give
Stanford "what it has never had: a
steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and
assisting educational innovation."
SES asked that a variety of
administrative offices be
centralized under the Dean,
including admissions, financial
aid, advising and freshman
seminars. The Dean should have
his own budget and some
involvement with faculty hiring
and promotion, said SES.
Students In Support
The student body has already
voiced strong support for the
proposal. Early in June, the
Student Education Council voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the
SES proposals for the new Dean.
The faculty promises to be
much more critical. The proposal
is seen by some as a challenge to
the traditional omnipotence of
academic departments. It is
uncertain how a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would fit
into the existing administrative
hierarchy.

proposal, but there has been much
discussion of what powers the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
should have. A majority of the
SES Government committee
favored an independent Dean who
answers only to the Provost. A
minority of the committee
believed the Dean should be on
the staff of the Dean of the
School of Humanities and
Sciences.
More Than Protocol
More than mere protocol is at
issue. An independent Dean,
working closely with many
departments and offices but
subordinate to none of them,
would certainly have more
freedom to encourage the
innovation and change that SES
desires. On the other hand, Prof.
Hubert Heffner has warned that
the Dean could use his
independence to "institute his
personal ideals of educational
reform," in competition with the
existing faculty structure.
The Academic Senate will hear
arguments on the issue from
faculty, students and
administrators on July 24.
Persons who wish to address
the Senate should submit
one-page abstracts of their
position to Prof. W.E. Meyerhof,
Room 15 2, Varian physics
building, who is chairman of the
floor management committee for
the proposal. The deadline for
abstracts is July 18. Selection of
speakers will be made by the
Floor Management Committee,
consisting of Norton Batkin,
Joyce Kobayashi, Michael
Sweeney and Professor Meyerhof.
SES states its proposal for the
Dean in a booklet entitled,
"Government of the University."
It notes that Stanford is the only
major private university in the
U.S. which lacks an administrative

In 1964 the new post of Dean
of Undergraduate Education was
mitigating factors which restrict
the jury's discretion in choosing a
penalty.
The difficulty with this
approach, which is recommended
in the Model Penal Code, is that
there is no practical means of
determining that a jury has, in
fact, followed these factors.
Another is to take the decision
out of the jury's hands and give it
to the trial judge. Here there is no
guarantee that the judge would
not be influenced by the same
inappropriate factors that now
affect the jury.
Third, the Legislature could
make the death sentence

mandatory for first-degree
murder, as it was several decades
ago in this state. This probably
would be "politically
unacceptable*' today.
Furthermore, it could lead juries
either to find defendants innocent
or guilty of a lesser offense.
Abolish Death Penalty
If all these alternatives are
unacceptable, the Legislature
could abolish the death penalty.
This approach "is the only one
that clearly will avoid the
administrative problems of
sentencing in first-degree murder
cases," the students note.
Their study covered nearly 200
factors which may influence a
jury's decision on sentencing after
a finding of guilt for first-degree
murder. Following a complex
statistical analysis, the study
showed that "juries . . . follow at
least one irrational standardâ€”the
occupational status of the
defendants."
Blue-collar defendants were
substantially more likely to
receive a death sentence on the
basis of that attribute alone, after
all other factors were taken into
consideration. These factors
included such things as the nature
of the crime, personal
characteristics of the victims,
murder weapons employed, etc.
Juries follow definite patterns
of decision-making, the students
found.

a finding of guilt for first-degree
murder. Following a complex
statistical analysis, the study
showed that "juries . . . follow at

occupational status of the
defendants."
Blue-collar defendants were
substantially more likely to
receive a death sentence on the

included such things as the nature

murder weapons employed, etc.

The warm lethargy of summer
will be stirred up a bit when the
Academic Senate considers the
controversial proposal for a new
Dean of Undergraduate Studies at
its next meeting, July 24.
Many faculty and students
regard the proposal for the new
Dean as one of the most
important recommendations of
the Study of Education at

Stanford (SES), which worked for
two years and came up with
hundreds of ideas for reform.
SES said the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would give
Stanford "what it has never had: a
steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and
assisting educational innovation."
SES asked that a variety of
administrative offices be
centralized under the Dean,
including admissions, financial
aid, advising and freshman
seminars. The Dean should have
his own budget and some
involvement with faculty hiring
and promotion, said SES.
Students In Support
The student body has already
voiced strong support for the
proposal. Early in June, the
Student Education Council voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the
SES proposals for the new Dean.
The faculty promises to be
much more critical. The proposal
is seen by some as a challenge to
the traditional omnipotence of
academic departments. It is
uncertain how a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would fit
into the existing administrative
hierarchy.

More Than Protocol
More than mere protocol is at
issue. An independent Dean,
working closely with many
departments and offices but
subordinate to none of them,
would certainly have more
freedom to encourage the
innovation and change that SES
desires. On the other hand, Prof.
Hubert Heffner has warned that
the Dean could use his
independence to "institute his
personal ideals of educational
reform," in competition with the
existing faculty structure.

Dean in a booklet entitled,
"Government of the University."
It notes that Stanford is the only

Hubert Heffner has warned that
the Dean could use his
independence to "institute his
personal ideals of educational
reform," in competition with the
existing faculty structure.
The Academic Senate will hear
arguments on the issue from
faculty, students and
administrators on July 24.
Persons who wish to address
the Senate should submit
one-page abstracts of their
position to Prof. W.E. Meyerhof,
Room 15 2, Varian physics
building, who is chairman of the
floor management committee for
the proposal. The deadline for
abstracts is July 18. Selection of
speakers will be made by the
Floor Management Committee,
consisting of Norton Batkin,
Joyce Kobayashi, Michael
Sweeney and Professor Meyerhof.
SES states its proposal for the
Dean in a booklet entitled,
"Government of the University."
It notes that Stanford is the only
major private university in the
U.S. which lacks an administrative
officer with responsibility for
overseeing the academic aspects of
undergraduate life. This has not
always been the case, however.
In 1964 the new post of Dean
of Undergraduate Education was
mitigating factors which restrict
the jury's discretion in choosing a
penalty.
The difficulty with this
approach, which is recommended
in the Model Penal Code, is that
there is no practical means of
determining that a jury has, in
fact, followed these factors.
Another is to take the decision
out of the jury's hands and give it
to the trial judge. Here there is no
guarantee that the judge would
not be influenced by the same
inappropriate factors that now
affect the jury.
Third, the Legislature could
make the death sentence

mandatory for first-degree
murder, as it was several decades
ago in this state. This probably
would be "politically
unacceptable*' today.
Furthermore, it could lead juries
either to find defendants innocent
or guilty of a lesser offense.
Abolish Death Penalty
If all these alternatives are
unacceptable, the Legislature
could abolish the death penalty.
This approach "is the only one
that clearly will avoid the
administrative problems of
sentencing in first-degree murder
cases," the students note.
Their study covered nearly 200
factors which may influence a
jury's decision on sentencing after
a finding of guilt for first-degree
murder. Following a complex
statistical analysis, the study
showed that "juries . . . follow at
least one irrational standardâ€”the
occupational status of the
defendants."
Blue-collar defendants were
substantially more likely to
receive a death sentence on the
basis of that attribute alone, after
all other factors were taken into
consideration. These factors
included such things as the nature
of the crime, personal
characteristics of the victims,
murder weapons employed, etc.
Juries follow definite patterns
of decision-making, the students
found.
The warm lethargy of summer
will be stirred up a bit when the
Academic Senate considers the
controversial proposal for a new
Dean of Undergraduate Studies at
its next meeting, July 24.
Many faculty and students
regard the proposal for the new
Dean as one of the most
important recommendations of
the Study of Education at

Stanford (SES), which worked for
two years and came up with
hundreds of ideas for reform.
SES said the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would give
Stanford "what it has never had: a
steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and
assisting educational innovation."
SES asked that a variety of
administrative offices be
centralized under the Dean,
including admissions, financial
aid, advising and freshman
seminars. The Dean should have
his own budget and some
involvement with faculty hiring
and promotion, said SES.
Students In Support
The student body has already
voiced strong support for the
proposal. Early in June, the
Student Education Council voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the
SES proposals for the new Dean.
The faculty promises to be
much more critical. The proposal
is seen by some as a challenge to
the traditional omnipotence of
academic departments. It is
uncertain how a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would fit
into the existing administrative
hierarchy.

proposal, but there has been much
discussion of what powers the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies

More Than Protocol
More than mere protocol is at
issue. An independent Dean,
working closely with many
departments and offices but
subordinate to none of them,
