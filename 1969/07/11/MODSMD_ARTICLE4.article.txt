# SES Plan Before Senate
## 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
The warm lethargy of summer
will be stirred up a bit when the
Academic Senate considers the
controversial proposal for a new
Dean of Undergraduate Studies at
its next meeting, July 24.
Many faculty and students
regard the proposal for the new
Dean as one of the most
important recommendations of
the Study of Education at

Stanford (SES), which worked for
two years and came up with
hundreds of ideas for reform.
SES said the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would give
Stanford "what it has never had: a
steady focus on its education of
undergraduates, supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
in the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and
assisting educational innovation."
SES asked that a variety of
administrative offices be
centralized under the Dean,
including admissions, financial
aid, advising and freshman
seminars. The Dean should have
his own budget and some
involvement with faculty hiring
and promotion, said SES.
Students In Support
The student body has already
voiced strong support for the
proposal. Early in June, the
Student Education Council voted
overwhelmingly in favor of the
SES proposals for the new Dean.
The faculty promises to be
much more critical. The proposal
is seen by some as a challenge to
the traditional omnipotence of
academic departments. It is
uncertain how a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies would fit
into the existing administrative
hierarchy.
Few voices have been raised in
Today
On this day in 1804 on the
Hudson Palisades, Weehawhen,
New Jersey, Vice President Aaron
Burr shot Alexander Hamilton in
a duel. The following day
Hamilton died of the wounds
in flic ted.
But the ideas which Hamilton
advocated in his day live on.
According to historian Gabriel
Kolko, the present foreign and
domestic policies of the United
States government can be
characterized as neo-Hamilionian.

direct opposition to the SES
proposal, but there has been much
discussion of what powers the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies
should have. A majority of the
SES Government committee
favored an independent Dean who
answers only to the Provost. A
minority of the committee
believed the Dean should be on
the staff of the Dean of the
School of Humanities and
Sciences.
More Than Protocol
More than mere protocol is at
issue. An independent Dean,
working closely with many
departments and offices but
subordinate to none of them,
would certainly have more
freedom to encourage the
innovation and change that SES
desires. On the other hand, Prof.
Hubert Heffner has warned that
the Dean could use his
independence to "institute his
personal ideals of educational
reform," in competition with the
existing faculty structure.
The Academic Senate will hear
arguments on the issue from
faculty, students and
administrators on July 24.
Persons who wish to address
the Senate should submit
one-page abstracts of their
position to Prof. W.E. Meyerhof,
Room 15 2, Varian physics
building, who is chairman of the
floor management committee for
the proposal. The deadline for
abstracts is July 18. Selection of
speakers will be made by the
Floor Management Committee,
consisting of Norton Batkin,
Joyce Kobayashi, Michael
Sweeney and Professor Meyerhof.
SES states its proposal for the
Dean in a booklet entitled,
"Government of the University."
It notes that Stanford is the only
major private university in the
U.S. which lacks an administrative
officer with responsibility for
overseeing the academic aspects of
undergraduate life. This has not
always been the case, however.
In 1964 the new post of Dean
of Undergraduate Education was
