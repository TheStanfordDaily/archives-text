# University Denies Use of Be-In Site
## 
### BILL EVERS 
The Stanford administration
has apparently decided not to
allow a be-in sponsored by the
Midpeninsula Free University to
be held July 20 in the fields near
Stanford Stadium.
SCORE, the on-campus
affiliate of the Free University,
applied to the Office of Public
Events for permission to hold the
be-in there.
Early Wednesday morning, Tim
Coburn, graduate in genetics, and
Tom Crystal, graduate in electrical
engineering, went to talk to J.
Thomas Bacchetti, director of
public events. Public events at
Stanford are defined as events
which are open to persons not
directly affiliated with the
University.
Bacchetti told Coburn and

Crystal that it was decided at a
meeting of the President's staff
the day before to impose a
"moratorium" on new outdoor
activities on University lands.
Coburn explained to Bacchetti
that he would have to convey
Stanford's decision to a meeting
of the Free University and asked
that Bacchetti put down the
decision in writing.
Bacchetti wrote out in his own
hand the following: "It is my
understanding that upon
recommendation of the Director
of Public Events all organized
outdoors activities not previously
approved will be temporarily
suspended until such time as a
review of policy concerning these
activities has been completed."
Coburn and Crystal after seeing
Bacchetti went directly to
President Kenneth Pitzer's office.
They gave his personal secretary
the memorandum written by
Bacchetti. Pitzer was busy with an
appointment at the time. After
consulting with Pitzer, his
secretary referred the two from
SCORE to Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley to answer their
questions. The impression which
Coburn and Crystal received at
the time was that Pitzer read the
memorandum and had no
disagreement with it. Pitzer told
The Daily last night that he does
not recall having read the
memorandum at the time.
Coburn talked with Bulkeley
that afternoon. Bulkeley said that
he was not aware of any
moratorium policy. According to
Coburn, Bulkeley indicated that
the President's staff meeting had
decided to get a lawyer to look
into the legal problems involved in
