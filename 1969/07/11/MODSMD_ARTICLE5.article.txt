# University Denies Use of Be-In Site
## 
### BILL EVERS 
The Stanford administration
has apparently decided not to
allow a be-in sponsored by the
Midpeninsula Free University to
be held July 20 in the fields near
Stanford Stadium.
SCORE, the on-campus
affiliate of the Free University,
applied to the Office of Public
Events for permission to hold the
be-in there.
Early Wednesday morning, Tim
Coburn, graduate in genetics, and
Tom Crystal, graduate in electrical
engineering, went to talk to J.
Thomas Bacchetti, director of
public events. Public events at
Stanford are defined as events
which are open to persons not
directly affiliated with the
University.
Bacchetti told Coburn and

Crystal that it was decided at a
meeting of the President's staff
the day before to impose a
"moratorium" on new outdoor
activities on University lands.
Coburn explained to Bacchetti
that he would have to convey
Stanford's decision to a meeting
of the Free University and asked
that Bacchetti put down the
decision in writing.
Bacchetti wrote out in his own
hand the following: "It is my
understanding that upon
recommendation of the Director
of Public Events all organized
outdoors activities not previously
approved will be temporarily
suspended until such time as a
review of policy concerning these
activities has been completed."
Coburn and Crystal after seeing
Bacchetti went directly to
President Kenneth Pitzer's office.
They gave his personal secretary
the memorandum written by
Bacchetti. Pitzer was busy with an
appointment at the time. After
consulting with Pitzer, his
secretary referred the two from
SCORE to Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley to answer their
questions. The impression which
Coburn and Crystal received at
the time was that Pitzer read the
memorandum and had no
disagreement with it. Pitzer told
The Daily last night that he does
not recall having read the
memorandum at the time.
Coburn talked with Bulkeley
that afternoon. Bulkeley said that
he was not aware of any
moratorium policy. According to
Coburn, Bulkeley indicated that
the President's staff meeting had
decided to get a lawyer to look
into the legal problems involved in

Coburn, Bulkeley indicated that
the President's staff meeting had
decided to get a lawyer to look
into the legal problems involved in
"outdoor activities."
Yesterday Coburn visited
Bulkeley again. Bulkeley asked
SCORE to resubmit its
application and on the new
application itemize what SCORE
planned to do at the site with
regard to toilet facilities,
cleaning-up afterwards, parking,
traffic control, possible property
damage, noise, and crowd control.
Coburn plans to submit a new
application, not necessarily for
the same site.
Pitzer and other administrators
have indicated that they do not
think that the site near the
football stadium is appropriate for
a be-in. Bacchetti told The Daily
that the application by SCORE
was undeniably the "catalyst" for
the Presidential staff meeting on
the use of University lands.
According to Pitzer, those at
the staff meeting agreed that the
decision last summer to deny the
Free University the use of the

same field should be repeated on
this occasion.
In August 1968, SCORE was
turned down by the University for
a similar event in the same place.
El Camino Park in Palo Alto was
the eventual site selected that
time. But now the Palo Alto City
Council has enacted an ordinance
limiting to 25 watts the electric
power used in sound
amplification.^
Yesterday, Bacchetti declared
that he had misinterpreted the
outcome of Tuesday's Presidential
staff meeting. He said that his
memorandum was the product of
a misunderstanding. According to
Bacchetti, all applications for the
use of University lands will be
considered individually, as in the
past.
Bacchetti also indicated that
the only area where the facilities
are appropriate for a be-in is
Searsville Lake, which is not
operated by the University.
Bacchetti is meeting Monday
with ASSU Financial Manager
Dave Swift to consider revisions
of the University's current general
policies on public events, which
have been in force since 1967.
Swift was a member of an ad hoc
committee head by former Dean
of Students Joel Smith which was
working on a new policy on
public events during the course of
the last school year. When Smith
left to assume the presidency of
Denison University, he turned
over the committee's material to
Swift.
Swift told The Daily that the
Committee on Public Exercises
was never consulted on
Bacchetti's moratorium
memorandum. Such policy
decisions are usually within the

Coburn, graduate in genetics, and
Tom Crystal, graduate in electrical
engineering, went to talk to J.
Thomas Bacchetti, director of
public events. Public events at
Stanford are defined as events
which are open to persons not
directly affiliated with the
University.
Bacchetti told Coburn and

Crystal that it was decided at a
meeting of the President's staff
the day before to impose a
"moratorium" on new outdoor
activities on University lands.
Coburn explained to Bacchetti
that he would have to convey
Stanford's decision to a meeting
of the Free University and asked
that Bacchetti put down the
decision in writing.
Bacchetti wrote out in his own
hand the following: "It is my
understanding that upon
recommendation of the Director
of Public Events all organized
outdoors activities not previously
approved will be temporarily
suspended until such time as a
review of policy concerning these
activities has been completed."
Coburn and Crystal after seeing
Bacchetti went directly to
President Kenneth Pitzer's office.
They gave his personal secretary
the memorandum written by
Bacchetti. Pitzer was busy with an
appointment at the time. After
consulting with Pitzer, his
secretary referred the two from
SCORE to Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley to answer their
questions. The impression which
Coburn and Crystal received at
the time was that Pitzer read the
memorandum and had no
disagreement with it. Pitzer told
The Daily last night that he does
not recall having read the
memorandum at the time.
Coburn talked with Bulkeley
that afternoon. Bulkeley said that
he was not aware of any
moratorium policy. According to
Coburn, Bulkeley indicated that
the President's staff meeting had
decided to get a lawyer to look
into the legal problems involved in
"outdoor activities."
Yesterday Coburn visited
Bulkeley again. Bulkeley asked
SCORE to resubmit its
application and on the new
application itemize what SCORE
planned to do at the site with
regard to toilet facilities,
cleaning-up afterwards, parking,
traffic control, possible property
damage, noise, and crowd control.
Coburn plans to submit a new
application, not necessarily for
the same site.
Pitzer and other administrators
have indicated that they do not
think that the site near the
football stadium is appropriate for
a be-in. Bacchetti told The Daily
that the application by SCORE
was undeniably the "catalyst" for
the Presidential staff meeting on
the use of University lands.
According to Pitzer, those at
the staff meeting agreed that the
decision last summer to deny the
Free University the use of the

same field should be repeated on
this occasion.
In August 1968, SCORE was
turned down by the University for
a similar event in the same place.
El Camino Park in Palo Alto was
the eventual site selected that
time. But now the Palo Alto City
Council has enacted an ordinance
limiting to 25 watts the electric
power used in sound
amplification.^
Yesterday, Bacchetti declared
that he had misinterpreted the
outcome of Tuesday's Presidential
staff meeting. He said that his
memorandum was the product of
a misunderstanding. According to
Bacchetti, all applications for the
use of University lands will be
considered individually, as in the
past.
Bacchetti also indicated that
the only area where the facilities
are appropriate for a be-in is
Searsville Lake, which is not
operated by the University.
Bacchetti is meeting Monday
with ASSU Financial Manager
Dave Swift to consider revisions
of the University's current general
policies on public events, which
have been in force since 1967.
Swift was a member of an ad hoc
committee head by former Dean
of Students Joel Smith which was
working on a new policy on
public events during the course of
the last school year. When Smith
left to assume the presidency of
Denison University, he turned
over the committee's material to
Swift.
Swift told The Daily that the
Committee on Public Exercises
was never consulted on
Bacchetti's moratorium
memorandum. Such policy
decisions are usually within the
purview of this committee.
The Stanford administration
has apparently decided not to
allow a be-in sponsored by the
Midpeninsula Free University to
be held July 20 in the fields near
Stanford Stadium.
SCORE, the on-campus
affiliate of the Free University,
applied to the Office of Public
Events for permission to hold the
be-in there.

Coburn, graduate in genetics, and
Tom Crystal, graduate in electrical
