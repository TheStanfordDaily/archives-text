Senator John McClellan's Permanent Subcommittee on
Investigations has begun to take on the academic community. Stanford,
led by President Kenneth S. Pitzer, was the first to come under the
Arkansas Democrat's blunderbuss fire.
Yesterday, the Academic Senate praised Pitzer-and the other
representatives of the University who testified at the hearings, Richard
Lyman, William Rambo, and Jack Friedenthal â€”for the way they
supported the internal integrity of the University, supported the
concept of academic freedom, and refused to knuckle under to
McClellan and other antediluvians.
When you consider that the Stanford contingent was the first group
summoned and had no foreknowledge of how the two days in the
spotlight would be conducted, the administrators performed admirably.
They restated with firmness their opinion that student disruptions
should be dealt with internally, and that the imposition of external
solutions can only exacerbate the situation which led to the disturbance
in the first place.
It is doubtful that this point made a sufficient impression on
McClellan and his friends, however. Some members of the committee,
such as Charles Percy of Illinois and Jacob Javits of New York, had a
more rational and open-minded approach to the question. Others came
in with their minds made up, closed, and sealed airtight. Radicals,
anarchists, and communists had conspired to create student unrest,
they had decided, and harsh measures were needed. Logic and facts had
no place in their thinking. But Pitzer and the others tried. Their efforts
were praiseworthy.
However, now that Stanford has heaved a sigh of relief with the end
of this trial by fire, a more complete examination of the declarations
made by the Stanford administrators is needed.
The gist of Pitzer's remarks was that he was trying to build up a
consensus within the University community on the issues at hand. The
issues unfortunately include the question of tactics. Basically, he was
saying that he wanted no outside intervention so tha he would have
enough time to quash the internal rebellion peacefully' and more
effectively.
Contrasted to McClellan and his fellow senators, the Stanford
administrators appeared as liberal knights in shining academic armor,
waving the banner of freedom and truth. But when you compare the
views or the situation Pitzer expressed in his testimony with the true
state of affairs, it is obvious Pitzer's views are as far from reality as
McClellan's are from Pitzer's.
Although most of the students here disavowed coercive tactics, the
large majority supported the demands of the activists. And the longer
the demands go unanswered, the longer the problems go unresolved, the
stronger the support will grow. Firm and decisive steps are
needed acceptance of the will of the community, and not merely the
will of the trustees.
II the present situation continues, the consensus that will develop
will not be one directed against the radicals, but one more firmly in
favor of them.
Pitzer has recuperated from the battle with McClellan. But he may
face a fight even more dangerous for him in the* fall.
