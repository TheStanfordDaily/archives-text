# Letters To The Editor
## The 						Stanford Consensus 
### 
To the EDITOR:
I notice that President Pitzer
has said, in his statement to the
McClellan Committee last
Tuesday, that "A broad consensus
should be achieved among
students, faculty, and
administrators concerning the
permissible ideas (oops, make that
"methods of presenting ideas")
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them."
I'm sure that everyone would
agree that such a consensus would
be desirable, but I have little hope
for peace in our time, especially
since each of these factions has its
own very characteristic program
for the presentation of ideas,
proposals, and grievances.
The administrators would have
a new form printed up, number
SU 11537'/4, with six different
pastel sheets interleaved with

carbon paper. Upon filling out the
Ideas, Proposals, and Grievances
form, you would tear out the fifth
carbon (pink) for your own
reference (if you can read fifth
carbons) and forward the original
and first four carbons to the head
of your department. If he wishes
to approve it, he will put his
signature in the authorization
block and forward it to the Office
of the Controller of Grievances.
Someone in this office will
remove the white copy (fourth
carbon) and return it to the
originator, file the yellow copy
(third carbon), and misplace the
remainder.
The faculty, as we all know,
are much more concerned with
rational dialogue. Upon informing
the head of your department
(personally or by a note to his
secretary) that you have an idea,
proposal, or grievance, you would

be invited to a monthly luncheon
in Frost Amphitheatre. Also
present would be one
representative from each
department or graduate school, all
other persons with grievances, and
twelve members of the Stanford
Police Dept. (just in case). Coffee
and eclairs would be served, and
the agenda would include
discussions of the weather,
women's hours, Big Game
festivities, and the Lake Lag
alligator. Within three weeks of
your attendance of this meeting,
you would be invited to a
conference with an Assistant Dean
of Students and the assistant head
of your department. At this
meeting you would be allowed to
formulate a proposal which would
be submitted to the Faculty
Committee on Ideas, Proposals,
and Grievances. This committee
would, if it was deemed feasible,
subject the proposal to a thorough
study and then present it to the
Academic Senate. The Academic
Senate would, within three regular
meetings after the committee's
report, table it.
The students, of course, are
interested in action. Within fifteen
minutes of the presentation of
your idea, proposal, or grievance
to a noon rally at White Plaza, a
meeting would be requested with
the President of the University,
followed within ten minutes by
the convergence of ten thousand
students and their supporters on
the President's office. They would
be accompanied by two hundred
hecklers from an opposing
faction, carrying cameras,
notepads, placards, and
walkie-talkies.

• Fluoridation
To the EDITOR:
Before publishing a one half
page article (The Case Against
Fluoridation) in your paper
reflecting an amature scientific
view, why not establish the total
picture so an individual can have
the opportunity to gather his
thoughts and make his own
decision?
Sure, there may be potential
unknown dangers of fluoridation
but what is known to be safe?
How has mankind increased its
development without its own
constructive ingenuity? Of course
in the same theme of thought
mankind could also give rise to its
own destruction. But at least we
consider both sides. You speak of
the hazards of fluoridation—how?
Spotty teeth produced by the
addition of more than the
recommended proportion of
fluoride to water? You also
critized the research and opinion
of many articles published in the
more than 7,000 international
medical journals. If you ignore the
expression of an intellectual elite,
what then is the point of
education? Even the dental
society supports the use of
fluorides. Are they supporting the
partial end of their profession or
being morally conscious?
As John Gardner expressed to
Mark Weiss, "You would rather
have it so that you could
manipulate the masses by clever
speech making . .
Why?

pastel sheets interleaved with

carbon paper. Upon filling out the
Ideas, Proposals, and Grievances
form, you would tear out the fifth
carbon (pink) for your own
reference (if you can read fifth
carbons) and forward the original
and first four carbons to the head
of your department. If he wishes
to approve it, he will put his
signature in the authorization
block and forward it to the Office
of the Controller of Grievances.
Someone in this office will
remove the white copy (fourth
carbon) and return it to the
originator, file the yellow copy
(third carbon), and misplace the
remainder.
The faculty, as we all know,
are much more concerned with
rational dialogue. Upon informing
the head of your department
(personally or by a note to his
secretary) that you have an idea,
proposal, or grievance, you would

be invited to a monthly luncheon
in Frost Amphitheatre. Also
present would be one
representative from each
department or graduate school, all
other persons with grievances, and
twelve members of the Stanford
Police Dept. (just in case). Coffee
and eclairs would be served, and
the agenda would include
discussions of the weather,
women's hours, Big Game
festivities, and the Lake Lag
alligator. Within three weeks of
your attendance of this meeting,
you would be invited to a
conference with an Assistant Dean
of Students and the assistant head
of your department. At this
meeting you would be allowed to
formulate a proposal which would
be submitted to the Faculty
Committee on Ideas, Proposals,
and Grievances. This committee
would, if it was deemed feasible,
subject the proposal to a thorough
study and then present it to the
Academic Senate. The Academic
Senate would, within three regular
meetings after the committee's
report, table it.
The students, of course, are
interested in action. Within fifteen
minutes of the presentation of
your idea, proposal, or grievance
to a noon rally at White Plaza, a
meeting would be requested with
the President of the University,
followed within ten minutes by
the convergence of ten thousand
students and their supporters on
the President's office. They would
be accompanied by two hundred
hecklers from an opposing
faction, carrying cameras,
notepads, placards, and
walkie-talkies.

• Fluoridation
To the EDITOR:
Before publishing a one half
page article (The Case Against
Fluoridation) in your paper
reflecting an amature scientific
view, why not establish the total
picture so an individual can have
the opportunity to gather his
thoughts and make his own
decision?
Sure, there may be potential
unknown dangers of fluoridation
but what is known to be safe?
How has mankind increased its
development without its own
constructive ingenuity? Of course
in the same theme of thought
mankind could also give rise to its
own destruction. But at least we
consider both sides. You speak of
the hazards of fluoridation—how?
Spotty teeth produced by the
addition of more than the
recommended proportion of
fluoride to water? You also
critized the research and opinion
of many articles published in the
more than 7,000 international
medical journals. If you ignore the
expression of an intellectual elite,
what then is the point of
education? Even the dental
society supports the use of
fluorides. Are they supporting the
partial end of their profession or
being morally conscious?
As John Gardner expressed to
Mark Weiss, "You would rather
have it so that you could
manipulate the masses by clever
speech making . .

I notice that President Pitzer
has said, in his statement to the
McClellan Committee last
Tuesday, that "A broad consensus
should be achieved among
students, faculty, and
administrators concerning the
permissible ideas (oops, make that
"methods of presenting ideas")
proposals, and grievances, and the
consequences of going beyond
them."
I'm sure that everyone would
agree that such a consensus would
be desirable, but I have little hope
for peace in our time, especially
since each of these factions has its
own very characteristic program
for the presentation of ideas,
proposals, and grievances.

a new form printed up, number
