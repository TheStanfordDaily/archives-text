EXCITED ABOUT YOUR FALL PLANS?
If not, consider this: a year in Grad School at UCLA in the
field of Public Health or English as a Second Language, 2 years
of service in Africa with the Peace Corps, followed by 2 or 3
quarters at UCLA.
You will then have a Master's Degree, 2 years of relevant
work experience, the satisfaction of helping others, another
language, and good prospects for stimulating work either here
or overseas.
Sound better than your present plans? Call us at UCLA col
lect (213) 825-4591.
(You need a B.A. and good enough grades for Graduate
Admission.)
