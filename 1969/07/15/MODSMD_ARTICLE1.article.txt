# SRI Protest Set For Today By 3 In SDS
## 
### MARSHALL SCHWARTZ 
Three members of the April
Third Movement and SDS will
hold a press conference in front of
the Stanford Research Institute's
main office in Menlo Park at noon
today, in defiance of warrants
issued for their arrest on charges
stemming from the May 16
demonstration at SRl's Hanover
Street facility.
Mark Heller, Scott Johnson,
and Marc Sapir have called the
conference at the Ravenswood
Avenue building to protest what
they call "a two-month campaign
of political arrests" aimed at the
local radical community.
The three are part of the latest
group of students and ex-students
to be charged with a variety of
violations as a result of the A3M
protest at SRI against military and
counterinsurgency research being
conducted there.
The total arrested or charged
now stands at 75.
Heller, Johnson, and
Sapir—who have not yet received
the warrants, but have been
informed of their issuance—have
declared that they will not
voluntarily surrender themselves
to police.
They plan to discuss what they
term "the prolonged harassment
by the Santa Clara County district
attorney and the Palo Alto police,
aided by Stanford, Stanford
Research Institute, and the
right-wing members of the student
body" of A3M and SDS.
The conservative students
referred to are members of the
Stanford chapter of Young
Americans for Freedom, who, led
by graduate student in
communications Harvey Hukari
Jr., took pictures of the protestors
in action on May 16.
These photographs, with
identifications provided by YAF
members and other anti-radical
students, have aided in the
prosecution of the demonstrators.

The three protestors expect to
be arrested tomorrow.
Only 15 of those arrested were
apprehended at the time of the
protest. All others have been
charged at different times during
the past two months.
The three activists will also
discuss tomorrow plans for a
protest during the SRI-sponsored
International Industrial
Conference in San Francisco in
September.
The meeting, held once every
four years, attracts business
leaders from around the world.
Movement members consider the
conference another part of SRl's
contribution to what they call
"U.S. economic imperialism."
At present, all of those charged
are being defended by Jim
Wolpman. The A3M Legal
Defense Committee had planned
to hold a benefit to raise legal
funds, but Stanford's recent ban
on all outdoor events on campus
ended that idea.
Two of the defendants have
pleaded guilty; the others have
either entered innocent pleas or
have not yet been arraigned.

to police.
They plan to discuss what they
term "the prolonged harassment
by the Santa Clara County district
attorney and the Palo Alto police,
aided by Stanford, Stanford
Research Institute, and the
right-wing members of the student
body" of A3M and SDS.
The conservative students
referred to are members of the
Stanford chapter of Young
Americans for Freedom, who, led
by graduate student in
communications Harvey Hukari
Jr., took pictures of the protestors
in action on May 16.
These photographs, with
identifications provided by YAF
members and other anti-radical
students, have aided in the
prosecution of the demonstrators.


ANOI HER TIME, ANOTHER PLACE—Mark Heller, one of three SDS members
who will hold a press conference at SRI today to protest "political arrests," here
protests Stanford lines against him and 28 others on Reg Day of spring quarter.
The three protestors expect to
be arrested tomorrow.
Only 15 of those arrested were
apprehended at the time of the
protest. All others have been
charged at different times during
the past two months.
The three activists will also
discuss tomorrow plans for a
protest during the SRI-sponsored
International Industrial
Conference in San Francisco in
September.
The meeting, held once every
four years, attracts business
leaders from around the world.
Movement members consider the
conference another part of SRl's
contribution to what they call
"U.S. economic imperialism."
At present, all of those charged
are being defended by Jim
Wolpman. The A3M Legal
Defense Committee had planned
to hold a benefit to raise legal
funds, but Stanford's recent ban
on all outdoor events on campus
ended that idea.
Two of the defendants have
pleaded guilty; the others have
either entered innocent pleas or
have not yet been arraigned.
Three members of the April
Third Movement and SDS will
hold a press conference in front of
the Stanford Research Institute's
main office in Menlo Park at noon
today, in defiance of warrants
issued for their arrest on charges
stemming from the May 16
demonstration at SRl's Hanover
Street facility.
Mark Heller, Scott Johnson,
and Marc Sapir have called the
conference at the Ravenswood
Avenue building to protest what
they call "a two-month campaign
of political arrests" aimed at the
local radical community.
The three are part of the latest
group of students and ex-students
to be charged with a variety of
violations as a result of the A3M
protest at SRI against military and
counterinsurgency research being
conducted there.
The total arrested or charged
now stands at 75.
Heller, Johnson, and
Sapir—who have not yet received
the warrants, but have been
informed of their issuance—have
declared that they will not
voluntarily surrender themselves
to police.
