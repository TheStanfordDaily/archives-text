Uncle Sam has done it again.
Samuel I. Hayakawa, that is.
The noted expert on general
semantics (the panacea for
everything from poverty to
hangnail) and student life, has just
been named permanent president
of San Francisco State College.
And Sunday afternoon, San
Francisco Congressman Philip
Burton—a man who should
k now—predicted that if the
primary were held today for the
Democratic Party nomination for
Senator, Hayakawa would win
hands down.
Maybe tarn o'shanters are
coming back in style.
Anyhow, the success of this
noted wire-pulling professor is just
another indication of the
right-wing reaction that has set in
across the nation in the wake of
last year's protests by students,

blacks, and other dispossessed
Americans. The mayoral elections
and primaries in Los Angeles,
Milwaukee, and New York are
even stronger indicators.
The tragedy is that the Bay
Area, long the hub of radical and
revolutionary activity, has been
the scene of a major triumph of
reaction. The city which boasts
the most far-sighted and liberal of
all major metropolitan dalies in
this country the Chronicle —has
fallen prey to the myopia of
Ronald Reagan and Glenn
Dumke.
Hayakawa was so successful in
crushing the revolt at SF State
because unlike his two
predecessors, Robert Smith and
John Summerskill, he felt little or
none of the frustration of the
Third World and radical white
students. While supporting many
of the rebels' goals—he often
proclaimed himself to be a liberal
Democrat—he had no qualms
about daily employing the Tac
Squad to keep some vague
semblance of order on the
strife-torn campus.
Smith and Summerskill both
felt the students' frustration at
the snail-paced progress at which
California's educational
superstructure inched towards
innovation. They wanted change,
and sensed that immediacy was
vital. But Hayakawa has been
more than content to slowly ooze
forward as Ronnie Reagan
squeezes improvements out of his
tube of academic toothpaste.
Uncle Sam feels cozy and
warm in the super-safe womb of
the system. He may be able to
keep peace at SF State, but the
school's once bright academic
reputation is slowly crumbling. He
may be an adept administrator,
but he is undoubtedly more suited
for Notre Dame (thank you,
Father Hesburgh) than State.
For me, Hayakawa conjures up
a strange assortment of images,
none of them consonant with that
of a college president: sitting in
the blaze of a dozen TV lights,
tarn perched jauntily on his head,
blue armband prominently
displayed. "My first week has
been the most exciting experience
in my life since my first roller
coaster ride." Or, joking with

newsmen, "Yes, I had kippered
herring for lunch again
today," . . .A group of little kids
at play. One swings at his fellow
with a stick, shouting the
fear-inspiring battle cry,
"Ha-Ya-Kawa!" . . .A huge black,
blood spurting from his head,
lying face down in the grass,
hands handcuffed behind his
back. A Tac Squad member prods
him with his riot stick, drags him
to his feet, then throws the black
back on the crimson-stained grass.
Whereupon the scene is
repeated . . .A policeman out cold
on the ground, a victim of a chair
leg hurled at his head by a
protestor. His fellows surround
him, protect him from the throng.
And you can see fear in their
eyes—for the first time during the
confrontation, fear walks both
sides of the line.
Hayakawa may believe that the
struggle which was finally resolved
late last spring has cleansed the
soul of SF State. But in fact,
Uncle Sam has destroyed it.

Ronald Reagan and Glenn
Dumke.
Hayakawa was so successful in
crushing the revolt at SF State
because unlike his two
predecessors, Robert Smith and
John Summerskill, he felt little or
none of the frustration of the
Third World and radical white
students. While supporting many
of the rebels' goals—he often
proclaimed himself to be a liberal
Democrat—he had no qualms
about daily employing the Tac
Squad to keep some vague
semblance of order on the
strife-torn campus.
Smith and Summerskill both
felt the students' frustration at
the snail-paced progress at which
California's educational
superstructure inched towards
innovation. They wanted change,
and sensed that immediacy was
vital. But Hayakawa has been
more than content to slowly ooze
forward as Ronnie Reagan
squeezes improvements out of his
tube of academic toothpaste.
Uncle Sam feels cozy and
warm in the super-safe womb of
the system. He may be able to
keep peace at SF State, but the
school's once bright academic
reputation is slowly crumbling. He
may be an adept administrator,
but he is undoubtedly more suited
for Notre Dame (thank you,
Father Hesburgh) than State.
For me, Hayakawa conjures up
a strange assortment of images,
none of them consonant with that
of a college president: sitting in
the blaze of a dozen TV lights,
tarn perched jauntily on his head,
blue armband prominently
displayed. "My first week has
been the most exciting experience
in my life since my first roller
coaster ride." Or, joking with

newsmen, "Yes, I had kippered
herring for lunch again
today," . . .A group of little kids
at play. One swings at his fellow
with a stick, shouting the
fear-inspiring battle cry,
"Ha-Ya-Kawa!" . . .A huge black,
blood spurting from his head,
lying face down in the grass,
hands handcuffed behind his
back. A Tac Squad member prods
him with his riot stick, drags him
to his feet, then throws the black
back on the crimson-stained grass.
Whereupon the scene is
repeated . . .A policeman out cold
on the ground, a victim of a chair
leg hurled at his head by a
protestor. His fellows surround
him, protect him from the throng.
And you can see fear in their
eyes—for the first time during the
confrontation, fear walks both
sides of the line.
Hayakawa may believe that the
struggle which was finally resolved
late last spring has cleansed the
soul of SF State. But in fact,
Uncle Sam has destroyed it.
Uncle Sam has done it again.
Samuel I. Hayakawa, that is.
The noted expert on general
semantics (the panacea for
everything from poverty to
hangnail) and student life, has just
been named permanent president
of San Francisco State College.
And Sunday afternoon, San
Francisco Congressman Philip
Burton—a man who should
k now—predicted that if the
primary were held today for the
Democratic Party nomination for
Senator, Hayakawa would win
hands down.
Maybe tarn o'shanters are
coming back in style.
Anyhow, the success of this
noted wire-pulling professor is just
another indication of the
right-wing reaction that has set in
across the nation in the wake of
last year's protests by students,

blacks, and other dispossessed
Americans. The mayoral elections
and primaries in Los Angeles,
Milwaukee, and New York are
even stronger indicators.
The tragedy is that the Bay
Area, long the hub of radical and
revolutionary activity, has been
the scene of a major triumph of
reaction. The city which boasts
the most far-sighted and liberal of
all major metropolitan dalies in
this country the Chronicle —has
fallen prey to the myopia of
Ronald Reagan and Glenn
Dumke.
