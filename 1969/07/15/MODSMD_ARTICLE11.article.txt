To the Editor:
My reaction to "The Great
Debate" between your Marc Weiss
and John Gardner is that Mr.
Weiss's views are typically
unrealistic of the young,
inexperienced and dissatisfied
college student making himself
heard today.
If Mr. W. believes —as he
states—that "Stanford is a shitty
university" then he should
certainly leave post haste and
make room available for one of
the score of young men who
would like to attend Stanford.
Furthermore, Mr. W's father (or
whoever is footing the bill for his
tuition) must be a real sucker for
punishment to continue paying
for Marc's unhappiness.
If he doesn't like or feel proud
of being a Stanford student, LET
HIM LEAVE! Better yet, ASK
him to leave!!!
