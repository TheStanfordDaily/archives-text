# SRI Department Head Quits; Says Disruptions Not Cause
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Although former director of
SRl's operations analysis
department, Kenneth Yudowich,
admitted, "I don't like rocks
thrown through my windows," he
stated that the spring student
demonstrations against SRI at
Hanover "played no significant
part" in his decision to form a
new independent research
company.
The new company, called
Operations Research Associates,
currently has a small
administrative staff made up of
individuals who are also former
members of SRl's operations
analysis department. Another
member of the SRI department is
expected to join Yudowich this
week.
According to Yudowich, "we
are seeking the opportunity to do
work by ourselvesâ€”to have greater
freedom."
Their leaving, he continued,
"wasn't really a question of
running away from the mobs or
yielding to expressions of
dissent."
''Things are just more
cumbersome in a large operation,"
he pointed out, "than in a smaller
one."
Yudowich also pointed to a
temporary lack of adequate
facilities for his department as one
of the problems he faced at SRI.
His department had recently
moved from SRl's Hanover
facility to the main offices on
Ravenswood Avenue, Menlo Park.
"Of course, new facilities were
being planned for," Yudowich
emphasized, "but the processes
were too slow."
He added, however, that he
had "enjoyed" his three years at
SRI and "found the associates
very friendly."
Government Studies
The new company, with offices
in Mountain View, plans to work
in operational analysis or studies

for the government, public service
agencies, and some industrial
clients.
According to Yudowich, the
company hopes to work primarily
in defense fields. These fields
could include weapons systems
analysis, military field
experimentation, cost
effectiveness studies, command
and control and military
intelligence analysis.
Weapons systems projects
could include research on the
feasibility of a given weapon for a
foot soldier. The company would
examine possible weapons and
recommend which would be the
best for various applications.
For military field
experimentation, the firm would
possibly design tests and
participate in their execution at a
military installation.
SRl's department of operations
analysis, also mainly concerned
with similar defense work,
recently had its staff reduced
from about 35 staff members to
some 25. In addition to those
individuals who left SRI to work
with the Operations Research
Associates, Yudowich noted that
"trimming back of the staff" was
also the result of "a drop in
business throughout the Institute,
and particularly in our division."
"The trimming back did not
directly result from student
demonstrations against SRI,"
Yudowich conjectured. "But
whether student unrest
contributed to the recent loss of
business, I can't say; it's possible,
but I've seen no real evidence."
The former SRI director
described student actions last May
against the SRI Hanover facility
to include "slogans painted all
over the walls; pipes and bricks
thrown through the windows."
"Most of us got in the building,
however,"he continued. "I saw a
couple of employees being pushed

around, but there was little or no
violence."
The operations analysis
department was reportedly the
only bureau remaining at the
Hanover facility when it was
attacked by student protesters.
Not Insensitive
When asked if public dissent
would influence his company's
acceptance of certain types of
contracts, Yudowich responded,
"Of course, I'm not insensitive to
public opinion, but I'm not so
frivolous as to have my mind
made up for me."
As to whether his company
would consider accepting
contracts dealing with chemical
and biological warfare research,
Yudowich answered, "Although
we have thus far received no
requests for such research, we
presently have no constraints
against it."
He added, "Some public
dissent is ill-advised . . .
"I'm not a total pacificist," he
stated. "I couldn't be and still
contemplate defense work."
"And I haven't seen anything
to demonstrate that there is a
substantial moral difference
between one kind of weapon and
another."
"Weapons are," Yudowich
concluded, "as the bumper sticker
says, unhealthy to living beings."
Tear Gas More Humane
But although Yudowich
admitted that he "wept
profusely" when some of the
police tear gas thrown last May at
demonstrators against SRI came
through the broken windows of
his office, he stated "I guess tear
gas is more humane than clubs or
bullets."
"I can't make a blanket
statement [about weapons] like
the people in mobs do."
"I feel that thinking rationally
about our actions is better at least
than throwing bricks."
