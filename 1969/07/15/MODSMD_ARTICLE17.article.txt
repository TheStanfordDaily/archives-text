# SDS Members Berate Businessmen
## 
### 
Businessmen are stopping man from
realizing his full potential by believing that
man is basically competitive, Jeanne Friedman
of Students for a Democratic Society told 120
American and foreign businessmen attending
the Stanford Executive Program in the
Graduate School of Business this week.
"If man competes and is aggressive, the end
result will be annihilation," the Stanford
graduate student in political science declared.
One of a series of student speakers invited to
address the executives, Miss Friedman is on
disciplinary probation as a result of her
campus activities.
She was accompanied by James Shoch, as
SDS member who has been suspended from
the University, effective fall quarter, for
similar reasons.
Shoch, a senior political science major,
said American foreign policy is a
manifestation of economic aggression by
American businessmen. It has been marked by
intervention after intervention in the affairs of
countries around the world, especially
underdeveloped nations.
"People my age and younger are worried
about that," Miss Friedman continued. "Man
is the only species that wipes himself out.
Why I am a radical has to do most basically
with my view of human nature. Man is not

evil or competitive by nature. On the
contrary, he's quite perfectable. Being
suspended or put on probation is a small price
to pay to stop it, and young people will go on
paying it."
When asked by the executives how they
would restructure the American economic
system and how they would visualize the
world without competition, Miss Friedman
said that the economy would work through
cooperation. "People would cooperate with
people and the work would get done."
Shoch added, "There are technocrats who
would work for themselves as well as for
anyone else in a factory. The incentive would
be running and owning the factory you work
in. There is no question that a change in
values will have to accompany this."
While agreeing with the businessmen that
wealth is created, Miss Friedman said that the
creation of wealth was not the problem.
"How wealth gets distributed is the important
thing," she said. "Exactly the same
proporation of the American population is
getting the same amount of money it was
getting 30, 40, and 50 years ago. Of course
the factory worker is better off than his
father, but the bottom is still getting the
bottom."
When an executive stated that there always

has to be a bottom and a top, Miss Friedman
said, "This is exactly where we differ. I don't
think this has to be true. The reason it is true
is that businessmen are making a profit off of
it. My view of man encompasses the belief
that there is something wrong in making a
profit off of other people's backs." She said
that this applies nationally and
internationally.
"What would you have us do differently?"
one executive asked. Miss Friedman replied,
"You're saying to me, what should I as a
capitalist do and my answer is don't be a
capitalist. That means you don't make profits
for yourselves. It means sharing the profits."
When asked about what she herself was
doing to promote her cause, Miss Friedman
said, "I am a revolutionary. I believe in action.
If I knew exactly what action to take, I'd be
out doing it. We're very unsure. That's why so
much of what we do is talk to people.
"If I have one basic thing to say, it's that
you do what you want to and you don't hurt
anyone else. And if that's one principle to live
by, I have to question your economic system.
My analysis tells me it's exploitation. If you
want only one thing to do, then the only sane
thing to do is to revise the method of wealth
allocation in the U.S. through socialism. Then
you share the wealth."

it. My view of man encompasses the belief
that there is something wrong in making a
profit off of other people's backs." She said
that this applies nationally and
internationally.
"What would you have us do differently?"
one executive asked. Miss Friedman replied,
"You're saying to me, what should I as a
capitalist do and my answer is don't be a
capitalist. That means you don't make profits
for yourselves. It means sharing the profits."
When asked about what she herself was
doing to promote her cause, Miss Friedman
said, "I am a revolutionary. I believe in action.
If I knew exactly what action to take, I'd be
out doing it. We're very unsure. That's why so
much of what we do is talk to people.
"If I have one basic thing to say, it's that
you do what you want to and you don't hurt
anyone else. And if that's one principle to live
by, I have to question your economic system.
My analysis tells me it's exploitation. If you
want only one thing to do, then the only sane
thing to do is to revise the method of wealth
allocation in the U.S. through socialism. Then
you share the wealth."
Businessmen are stopping man from
realizing his full potential by believing that
man is basically competitive, Jeanne Friedman
of Students for a Democratic Society told 120
American and foreign businessmen attending
the Stanford Executive Program in the
Graduate School of Business this week.
"If man competes and is aggressive, the end
result will be annihilation," the Stanford
graduate student in political science declared.
One of a series of student speakers invited to
address the executives, Miss Friedman is on
disciplinary probation as a result of her
campus activities.
She was accompanied by James Shoch, as
SDS member who has been suspended from
the University, effective fall quarter, for
similar reasons.
Shoch, a senior political science major,
said American foreign policy is a
manifestation of economic aggression by
American businessmen. It has been marked by
intervention after intervention in the affairs of
countries around the world, especially
underdeveloped nations.
"People my age and younger are worried
about that," Miss Friedman continued. "Man
is the only species that wipes himself out.
Why I am a radical has to do most basically
with my view of human nature. Man is not

evil or competitive by nature. On the
contrary, he's quite perfectable. Being
suspended or put on probation is a small price
to pay to stop it, and young people will go on
paying it."
When asked by the executives how they
would restructure the American economic
system and how they would visualize the
world without competition, Miss Friedman
said that the economy would work through
cooperation. "People would cooperate with
people and the work would get done."
Shoch added, "There are technocrats who
would work for themselves as well as for
anyone else in a factory. The incentive would
be running and owning the factory you work
in. There is no question that a change in
values will have to accompany this."
While agreeing with the businessmen that
wealth is created, Miss Friedman said that the
creation of wealth was not the problem.
"How wealth gets distributed is the important
thing," she said. "Exactly the same
proporation of the American population is
getting the same amount of money it was
getting 30, 40, and 50 years ago. Of course
the factory worker is better off than his
father, but the bottom is still getting the
bottom."
When an executive stated that there always

has to be a bottom and a top, Miss Friedman
said, "This is exactly where we differ. I don't
think this has to be true. The reason it is true
is that businessmen are making a profit off of
it. My view of man encompasses the belief
that there is something wrong in making a
profit off of other people's backs." She said
that this applies nationally and
