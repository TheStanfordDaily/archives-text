• Pay Hike
A major change in
compensation policy for Stanford
University Hospital employees
was announced yesterday by Dr.
Thomas A. Gonda, director of the
hospital.
The new policy, approved
Saturday by the hospital board of
directors, sets the hospital
minimum wage for full-time
employees at $450 a month, and
calls for a standard increase of
$40 a month for all other
full-time hospital employees.
In addition, it provides the
framework for other wage
adjustments based on merit,
promotion, and competition to
enable the hospital to attract and
retain outstanding employees at
all levels, Dr. Gonda said.
This is the first major change in
the hospital's direct compensation
policy since Stanford University
bought the former Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital and
assumed responsibility for its
management a year ago.
The wage policy will take
effect retroactive to July 7, Dr.
Gonda said.
• Rate Increase
An increase in daily service
rates beginning today was
announced by the Stanford
University Hospital.
"To meet increased costs of
operation that reflect the
continuing rise in costs of material
and employee compensation, we
find it necessary to increase our
daily service rate," said Dr.
Thomas A. Gonda, director of the
hospital.
The daily rates, approved
Saturday by the hospital board of
directors, will be increased on the

average of $7.50 for semi-private
rooms for medical and surgical
patients.
The new basic rates are: ward
$55, semi-private $60, and private
$68.50.
Dr. Gonda said that the
hospital is attempting to reduce
the time a patient spends in the
hospital, and in some cases this
will help offset some of the
impact of the rate increase.
He said many physicians are
taking advantage of the new
pretesting program in which the
hospital participates. This
program enables certain patients
to complete their medical tests at
the hospital before being
admitted. Such pretesting alone
has reduced the length of
hospitalization.
"The fact the Stanford
University Hospital is highly
specialized also enables us to take
care of comparably serious
illnesses in a shorter time," Dr.
Gonda said. "We have statistics
which show that our hospital
compares favorably with other
teaching hospitals in terms of
length of time patients remain
hospitalized."
• Cigarettes
Cigarette sales will be banned
at Stanford University Hospital
within a month.
The ruling came Saturday
when a resolution to stop the sale
of cigarettes was approved by the
Stanford University Hospital
board of directors.
The ban of cigarettes at the
hospital was recommended by the
hospital medical board. The
resolution said that "in the
medical opinion of the board
cigarette smoking is hazardous to
health."

The daily rates, approved
Saturday by the hospital board of
directors, will be increased on the

average of $7.50 for semi-private
rooms for medical and surgical
patients.
The new basic rates are: ward
$55, semi-private $60, and private
$68.50.
Dr. Gonda said that the
hospital is attempting to reduce
the time a patient spends in the
hospital, and in some cases this
will help offset some of the
impact of the rate increase.
He said many physicians are
taking advantage of the new
pretesting program in which the
hospital participates. This
program enables certain patients
to complete their medical tests at
the hospital before being
admitted. Such pretesting alone
has reduced the length of
hospitalization.
"The fact the Stanford
University Hospital is highly
specialized also enables us to take
care of comparably serious
illnesses in a shorter time," Dr.
Gonda said. "We have statistics
which show that our hospital
compares favorably with other
teaching hospitals in terms of
length of time patients remain
hospitalized."
• Cigarettes
Cigarette sales will be banned
at Stanford University Hospital
within a month.
The ruling came Saturday
when a resolution to stop the sale
of cigarettes was approved by the
Stanford University Hospital
board of directors.
The ban of cigarettes at the
hospital was recommended by the
hospital medical board. The
resolution said that "in the
medical opinion of the board
cigarette smoking is hazardous to
health."
• Pay Hike
A major change in
compensation policy for Stanford
University Hospital employees
was announced yesterday by Dr.
Thomas A. Gonda, director of the
hospital.
The new policy, approved
Saturday by the hospital board of
directors, sets the hospital
minimum wage for full-time
employees at $450 a month, and
calls for a standard increase of
$40 a month for all other
full-time hospital employees.
In addition, it provides the
framework for other wage
adjustments based on merit,
promotion, and competition to
enable the hospital to attract and
retain outstanding employees at
all levels, Dr. Gonda said.
This is the first major change in
the hospital's direct compensation
policy since Stanford University
bought the former Palo
Alto-Stanford Hospital and
assumed responsibility for its
management a year ago.
The wage policy will take
effect retroactive to July 7, Dr.
Gonda said.
• Rate Increase
An increase in daily service
rates beginning today was
announced by the Stanford
University Hospital.
"To meet increased costs of
operation that reflect the
continuing rise in costs of material
and employee compensation, we
find it necessary to increase our
daily service rate," said Dr.
Thomas A. Gonda, director of the
hospital.
The daily rates, approved
Saturday by the hospital board of
directors, will be increased on the

average of $7.50 for semi-private
rooms for medical and surgical
patients.
