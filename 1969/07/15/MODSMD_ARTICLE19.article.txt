# Sounds Like Summer
## The
						Unbroken Circle 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Most audiences would not
recognize the name of a girl singer
called Joan Harris, but it means
something special here at
Stanford. Perhaps we are a bit too
possessive of Joanie and
David—like the small-town kids
who made good—but many
thousands of us feel a special
bond with our shorn prophet and
his sad-eyed lady.
The massive institution which
is Stanford may not wish to claim
them, but a huge number of
usu ally-undemonstrative people
certainly would. It is for David,
and for us, and for those who
might be among us someday, that
Joan Baez Harris has made a
record, "David's Album"
(Vanguard).
This is far more than "just
another record." Technically and
musically it is as good or better
than any of Joanie's other albums,
but the meaning to be found here
makes this a personal letter
besides a moving musical
experience.
Joan is speaking of their life,
and the lives of many of us
wrapped in the same cyclone of
threats and fears. She is speaking
of the joy and the pain which has
been, and the hope and despair of
now. She is as eloquent in her
songs as ever David was in his
speeches, but while David struck
out at social effects, Joan tells of
the very personal ones.
David sent his Selective Service
cards back to the government
several years ago, because he felt
that he could no longer co-operate
with their system of involuntary
servitude and rationalized
homicide. In 1966, he was as
surprised as the Dean's office
when he found himself elected
Student Body President; he used
the office as a platform to
harangue his adversaries, support
his own ideas, shake us out of
complacency, and thoroughly
discomfort official Stanford.

He was a great speechmaker,
but he could not rest in the mold
of rule-bound administrators, and
he resigned at mid-year. We
expected Big Brother to snatch
him quickly away after June of
'67, but the government simply
didn't know what to do with him.
Meanwhile, David was
founding the Resistance,
preaching pacifism and
non-cooperation with the
Selective Service, and other
similarly un-American activities. A
year ago he and Joan Baez were
married, and David had a job at
Joan's school of non-violent
resistance.
The government has finally
decided that David needed three
years of re-habilitation, and he
will be starting them shortly. Joan
will have their child to remember
him; he will have their album to
remember her. And we are invited
to share.
The song's on "David's
Album" are folksy and honest,
not slick and commercial. Joan
says that this is the music David
likes best. People who don't know
the Harris' story or who don't
want to know it can still enjoy the
record, for Joanie's sparkling
voice and the fine
accompaniments make the
recording a musical delight.
Joan is today's greatest female
vocalist in any idiom, anywhere.
But "David's Album" becomes
infinitely larger and impressive
when we read what Joanie has to
say, when we know why she made
this album. The songs become
protests as gentle and yet as
powerful as Ghandi's Salt March.
Joan speaks as a sensitive angel,
pleading, "Don't you see what
you're doing?"
Her songs are mainly of the
future, with the thought that
farther along men will learn to live
together in peace. But she says
that if the future is to be good, we
must work to make it so. Joan
and David say we must use the
gentle way.

David is making his protest,
and in this album, Joan is making
hers. It is soft, quiet, subtle, but
far more expressive than 10,000
blazing marches could ever be.
Listening to Joan's words, and
understanding their meaning,
becomes an accusation of
complacency and a call to action.
No thinking, feeling man can
listenunimpassioned to thisalbum.
It is beauty, and it is fire. You
must hear it.
This week the Peninsula will be
full of music, from fourteenth
century processionals to hard
rock. Early music fills half the
calendar, The New York Pro
Musica presents "Music of the
Mediterranean World of the Late
Middle Ages" tonight at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel, and follows with
"Music of the Italian Courts at the
End of the Renaissance" at the
same time and place on July 18.
The Stanford Renaissance
Band, a more informal group, will
perform "German Music of the
Renaissance" at 8 p.m. in
Dinkelspiel on July 16. All this
unusual music will be explained
by John Hollander of the New
York Pro Musica at a free
audience briefing sponsored by
the Stanford Summer Festival at
4:30 in Tresidder, also on
Wednesday July 16.
This discussion by a
well-known scholar of early music
and literature will be an invaluable
aid to anyone interested in this

music.
The free Sunday afternoon
concert series continues in
Carmel, at the Forest Theater.
This Sunday at 2 p.m. guitarist
Peter Evans will perform.
Arthur Fiedler will lead the
San Francisco Pops Orchestra,
with pianist Roy Bolgas, in a
concert at 8:30 p.m. in the San
Jose Civic Auditorium. This is the
second in a series of five such
Pops concerts the Boston Maestro
will conduct in the Bay Area this
month and next
Opening tonight in the Jazz
Tent near Mem Aud is DeDe and
Billie Pierce's amazing
Preservation Hall Jazz Band. They
represent the last of the fantastic
era of true New Orleans jazz. Last
year at the Summer Festival they

were sold out at each show; this
year they will play a total of
twenty concerts, nightly at 8:30
and 10:30. It would be utter
foolishness to miss the PHJB this
year; we may never have the
opportunity again. Tickets are all
general admission, but must be
purchased in advance at the
Summer Festival Box Office
(x 2935). Arrive early.
Stan Kenton invades Basin
Street West in the City this week,
and I think you can get free
tickets by writing the club
(drinks, of course, aren't free).
Kenton has a great band, and he
himself is one of the most
talented jazz arrangers around.
At the Fillmore this weekend:
Country Joe and 8.8. King. Need
I say more?
