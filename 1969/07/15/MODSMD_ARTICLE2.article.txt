Dr. William T. Summerlin of

Medicine told a New York
meeting of the Society for
Investigative Dermatology that
skin grown in laboratory cultures
for periods up to six weeks acted
as a source of new skin cells in
ulcerated or burn wounds,
Eight patients at Stanford
University Hospital have been
studied with the new
experimental technique and have
grown normal skin after receiving
skin grafts grown in test tubes.
Four days after implantation
of the cultured skin, epithelial
cells had multiplied and formed a
layer over the wound sites. On the
third week, the cells in the
transplant area had organized into
a typical would-healing type of
epidermis with normal cells and
structure. By the sixth week the
patients' wounds had healed and
were covered by normal skin.
Maintained In Culture
"We have shown conclusively
that epidermal cells can be
maintained in tissue culture for
periods up to six weeks and that
they can be transplanted
successfully," Summerlin said.
"The successful transplantation
of cultured skin back to the
original host demonstrates that
epithelial cells retain their ability
to differentiate," he said. "Many
other kinds of cells rapidly
become undifferentiated when
they are grown in culture, forming
a nonspecific cell type. But the
epithelial cell keeps many of its
natural qualities when it is
maintained in the test tube."
The Stanford study was
supported by grants from the
National Institute of Arthritis and
Metabolic Diseases of the National
Institutes of Health. Summerlin's
collaborators are Dr. Marvin A.
Karasek, associate professor of
biochemistry and research
dermatology, and Miss Mary Ellen
Charlton, senior research assistant.
Karasek's Basic Work
It was Karasek's basic work

that has led to the limited clinical
application. In 1967, he
demonstrated that cells taken
from a rabbit and cultured for 14
days in a test tube grew normally
when transplanted to the host
animal. Karasek's finding ran
counter to the belief among
dermatologists that cultured adult
skin cells had no ability to form a
specific tissue.
Until that time it was thought
that skin would not survive for
more than 14 days even under the
common methods of preservation
by refrigeration.
"The physiology of the
cultured transplanted skin in the
human patients is remarkably like
that of any fresh skin grafts,"
Sum merlin said. The newly
formed skin has tolerated friction
and other trauma, and has also
shown perspiration signs.
He said that the Stanford
patients have been studied for a
period of 4 to 15 months after
grafting, with no evidence of any
abnormality in the graft sites.
No Therapeutic Uses
Summerlin cautioned that "no
widespread therapeutic uses can
be suggested at this time," but
noted that the potential clinical
applications of the technique "are
real and might come to pass after
more patients are studied."
When it is certan that no basic
changes are induced by long-term
maintenance of skin in organ
culture, then "banks" of cultured
skin may become practical.
He noted that the technique
should be considered as an
additional approach to present
methods of skin grafting.

Until that time it was thought
that skin would not survive for
more than 14 days even under the
common methods of preservation
by refrigeration.
"The physiology of the
cultured transplanted skin in the
human patients is remarkably like
that of any fresh skin grafts,"
Sum merlin said. The newly
formed skin has tolerated friction
and other trauma, and has also
shown perspiration signs.
He said that the Stanford
patients have been studied for a
period of 4 to 15 months after
grafting, with no evidence of any
abnormality in the graft sites.
No Therapeutic Uses
Summerlin cautioned that "no
widespread therapeutic uses can
be suggested at this time," but
noted that the potential clinical
applications of the technique "are
real and might come to pass after
more patients are studied."
When it is certan that no basic
changes are induced by long-term
maintenance of skin in organ
culture, then "banks" of cultured
skin may become practical.
He noted that the technique
should be considered as an
additional approach to present
methods of skin grafting.
Actual reconstructionof human
skin by tissue grown under
artificial conditions outside a
living organism was reported
Saturday by a Stanford medical
research team.
Dr. William T. Summerlin of
the Stanford University School of
Medicine told a New York
meeting of the Society for
Investigative Dermatology that
skin grown in laboratory cultures
for periods up to six weeks acted
as a source of new skin cells in
ulcerated or burn wounds,
Eight patients at Stanford
University Hospital have been
studied with the new
experimental technique and have
grown normal skin after receiving
skin grafts grown in test tubes.
Four days after implantation
of the cultured skin, epithelial
cells had multiplied and formed a
layer over the wound sites. On the
third week, the cells in the
transplant area had organized into
a typical would-healing type of
epidermis with normal cells and
structure. By the sixth week the
patients' wounds had healed and
were covered by normal skin.
Maintained In Culture
"We have shown conclusively
that epidermal cells can be
maintained in tissue culture for
periods up to six weeks and that
they can be transplanted
successfully," Summerlin said.
"The successful transplantation
of cultured skin back to the
original host demonstrates that
epithelial cells retain their ability
to differentiate," he said. "Many
other kinds of cells rapidly
become undifferentiated when
they are grown in culture, forming
a nonspecific cell type. But the
epithelial cell keeps many of its
natural qualities when it is
maintained in the test tube."
The Stanford study was
supported by grants from the
National Institute of Arthritis and
Metabolic Diseases of the National
Institutes of Health. Summerlin's
collaborators are Dr. Marvin A.
Karasek, associate professor of
biochemistry and research
dermatology, and Miss Mary Ellen
Charlton, senior research assistant.
Karasek's Basic Work
It was Karasek's basic work

that has led to the limited clinical
application. In 1967, he
demonstrated that cells taken
from a rabbit and cultured for 14
days in a test tube grew normally
when transplanted to the host
animal. Karasek's finding ran
counter to the belief among
dermatologists that cultured adult
skin cells had no ability to form a
specific tissue.
