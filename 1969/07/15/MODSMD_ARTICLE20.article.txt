• New Professors
Three major appointments to
the Stanford University faculty
were announced today by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer. They
are effective Sept: 1.
The three are Anthony G.
Amsterdam, professor of law;
Frank Bonilla, professor of
political science; and George
Herrmann, professor of applied
mechanics and civil engineering.
Amsterdam, 33, on leave from
the University of Pennsylvania
Law School to serve as an
attorney with the NAACP's
Defense and Educational Fund
Inc., is regarded as one of the
outstanding legal educators in the
nation, according to Dean Bayless
Manning of Stanford Law School.
Amsterdam has played a major
role in innovating litigation in the
criminal courts, and he will add
strength to the Law School's
specialists in criminal law.
Bonilla, 44, is a native of New
York City. He was graduated from
CCNY and earned his advanced
degrees from New York
University and Harvard.
He has been director of
communications research of
International Research Associates
and a researcher for American
Universities Field staff until
joining the MIT faculty in 1963.
He holds a degree in sociology
as well as in political science and
has had extensive overseas
research experience. His teaching
technique has involved his
students in the study of policy
problems, especially in those of
Latin America.
Herrmann,a native of Russia, is
48. He became a U.S. citizen in
1956 after lengthy residence in
Switzerland.
He has been a professor at
Northwestern University since
1962, where has has held the
endowed Walter P. Murphy
distinguished professorship.
In the words of Dean Joseph
H. Pettit of Stanford's School of
Engineering, Prof. Herrmann
bridges the gap between applied
mechanics and structural
engineering, through his own
research and his editing of the
International Journal of Solids
and Structures.
• Talking Computers
Research has already started at
Stanford on how to develop a
talking computer, but the teacher
is a long way from becoming
obsolete, participants in the
annual School Planning Institute
learned last week.
Speakers included Prof. Robert
N. Bush, director of the School of
Education's Research and
Development Center, Prof. Patrick
Suppres, director of curriculum
research in the Honolulu city
schools. •
Suppes revealed he had
received a grant just a week ago to
begin research on a computer

which can communicate audibly
with the student as well as by
teletype, which is the case at
present.
He discussed computer-assisted
instruction informally with the
200 delegates to the 19th annual
event, sponsored by the Stanford
School of Education and the
School Planning Laboratory.
John Dewey's ideal of
individual instruction was realized
by computer-assisted instruction,
Prof. Suppes said, because the
computer can devote its individual
attention to 150 students at once
in a micro-second (one millionth
of a second) so vast are its
electronic capabilities.
He predicted that in 15 years
or so, the computer might be able
to communicate verbally with
students, answering substantive
questions.
Bush, however, predicted that
education, the schools and the
teachers themselves will become
more, not less important, in
coming decades.
Schools, he said, will become
more integrated with the
community than ever before,
because "more people will be in
school taking more things for a
longer time."
Curricula will become
"exciting new tools" for teaching,
he predicted, because of the
wealth of new instructional
materials coming from research
and development, and computers
will become a major factor in
lifting clerical burdens from the
backs of teachers, as well as
assisting in instruction and
scheduling.
Teachers will be used
differently, and more teaching
aides and paraprofessionals will
appear in the classroom. There
will be a trend to smaller classes,
more individualized instruction,
and the teacher himself will
become a more professionalized
person on the level of a lawyer or a
doctor, Bush prophesied.
• Admissions
Dr. Stirling L. Huntley,
associate director of admissions at
Stanford, has been appointed
director of admissions at the
East-West Center, University of
Hawaii, Honolulu, it was
announced in Honolulu.
He takes over his new position
Sept. 1.
Dr. Huntley, a graduate of
UCLA and a native of Riverside,
earned his doctorate in speech and
drama at Stanford in 1955.
He served as an assistant
professor of speech and drama for
two years, then joined the
admissions office staff in 1958.
He was appointed associate
director in 1960.
• School Curriculum
No changes will be made in
American school curriculum
unless you can assure the teachers
involved that their jobs are secure.

This flat dictum was laid before
the 19th annual School Planning
Institute last Tuesday by Prof.
William Georgeades, chairman of
University of Southern
California's Department of
Education and consultant to
many school districts.
"Desirable curriculum changes
have failed over and over again
because these principles have been
violated," he told the 200
delegates to the conference,
sponsored by the Stanford School
of Education.
He was speaking specifically of
the Hood River, Oregon, school

district, whose recent educational
history took up the Tuesday
morning session.
"You have to involve the
teachers themselves and convince
them of the value of a
polygamous inter-related
approach to learning goais," he
told the gathering. English, he
predicted, will splinter into oral
and written communication,
literature and social studies in
general.
"English teachers are always
the worst. They never know
what's going on. I know because I
used to be one," he quipped.

instruction informally with the
200 delegates to the 19th annual
event, sponsored by the Stanford
School of Education and the

John Dewey's ideal of
individual instruction was realized
by computer-assisted instruction,
Prof. Suppes said, because the
computer can devote its individual
attention to 150 students at once
in a micro-second (one millionth
of a second) so vast are its
electronic capabilities.
He predicted that in 15 years
or so, the computer might be able
to communicate verbally with
students, answering substantive
questions.
Bush, however, predicted that
education, the schools and the
teachers themselves will become
more, not less important, in
coming decades.
Schools, he said, will become
more integrated with the
community than ever before,
because "more people will be in
school taking more things for a
longer time."
Curricula will become
"exciting new tools" for teaching,
he predicted, because of the
wealth of new instructional
materials coming from research
and development, and computers
will become a major factor in
lifting clerical burdens from the
backs of teachers, as well as
assisting in instruction and
scheduling.
Teachers will be used
differently, and more teaching
aides and paraprofessionals will
appear in the classroom. There
will be a trend to smaller classes,
more individualized instruction,
and the teacher himself will
become a more professionalized
person on the level of a lawyer or a
doctor, Bush prophesied.
• Admissions
Dr. Stirling L. Huntley,
associate director of admissions at
Stanford, has been appointed
director of admissions at the
East-West Center, University of
Hawaii, Honolulu, it was
announced in Honolulu.
He takes over his new position
Sept. 1.
Dr. Huntley, a graduate of
UCLA and a native of Riverside,
earned his doctorate in speech and
drama at Stanford in 1955.
He served as an assistant
professor of speech and drama for
two years, then joined the
admissions office staff in 1958.
He was appointed associate
director in 1960.
• School Curriculum
No changes will be made in
American school curriculum
unless you can assure the teachers
involved that their jobs are secure.

This flat dictum was laid before
the 19th annual School Planning
Institute last Tuesday by Prof.
William Georgeades, chairman of
University of Southern
California's Department of
Education and consultant to
many school districts.
"Desirable curriculum changes
have failed over and over again
because these principles have been
violated," he told the 200
delegates to the conference,
sponsored by the Stanford School
of Education.
He was speaking specifically of
the Hood River, Oregon, school

district, whose recent educational
history took up the Tuesday
morning session.
"You have to involve the
teachers themselves and convince
them of the value of a
polygamous inter-related
approach to learning goais," he
told the gathering. English, he
predicted, will splinter into oral
and written communication,
literature and social studies in
general.
"English teachers are always
the worst. They never know
what's going on. I know because I
used to be one," he quipped.
• New Professors
Three major appointments to
the Stanford University faculty
were announced today by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer. They
are effective Sept: 1.
The three are Anthony G.
Amsterdam, professor of law;
Frank Bonilla, professor of
political science; and George
Herrmann, professor of applied
mechanics and civil engineering.
Amsterdam, 33, on leave from
the University of Pennsylvania
Law School to serve as an
attorney with the NAACP's
Defense and Educational Fund
Inc., is regarded as one of the
outstanding legal educators in the
nation, according to Dean Bayless
Manning of Stanford Law School.
Amsterdam has played a major
role in innovating litigation in the
criminal courts, and he will add
strength to the Law School's
specialists in criminal law.
Bonilla, 44, is a native of New
York City. He was graduated from
CCNY and earned his advanced
degrees from New York
University and Harvard.
He has been director of
communications research of
International Research Associates
and a researcher for American
Universities Field staff until
joining the MIT faculty in 1963.
He holds a degree in sociology
as well as in political science and
has had extensive overseas
research experience. His teaching
technique has involved his
students in the study of policy
problems, especially in those of
Latin America.
Herrmann,a native of Russia, is
48. He became a U.S. citizen in
1956 after lengthy residence in
Switzerland.
He has been a professor at
Northwestern University since
1962, where has has held the
endowed Walter P. Murphy
distinguished professorship.
In the words of Dean Joseph
H. Pettit of Stanford's School of
Engineering, Prof. Herrmann
bridges the gap between applied
mechanics and structural
engineering, through his own
research and his editing of the
International Journal of Solids
and Structures.
• Talking Computers
Research has already started at
Stanford on how to develop a
talking computer, but the teacher
is a long way from becoming

annual School Planning Institute
learned last week.
Speakers included Prof. Robert

Education's Research and
Development Center, Prof. Patrick
Suppres, director of curriculum
research in the Honolulu city
schools. •
Suppes revealed he had
received a grant just a week ago to
begin research on a computer

which can communicate audibly
with the student as well as by
teletype, which is the case at
present.

because these principles have been
violated," he told the 200
delegates to the conference,
sponsored by the Stanford School
of Education.
He was speaking specifically of
the Hood River, Oregon, school

district, whose recent educational
history took up the Tuesday
morning session.
"You have to involve the
teachers themselves and convince
them of the value of a
polygamous inter-related
approach to learning goais," he
told the gathering. English, he
predicted, will splinter into oral
and written communication,
literature and social studies in
general.
"English teachers are always
the worst. They never know
what's going on. I know because I
used to be one," he quipped.
• New Professors
Three major appointments to
the Stanford University faculty
were announced today by
President Kenneth S. Pitzer. They
are effective Sept: 1.
The three are Anthony G.
Amsterdam, professor of law;
Frank Bonilla, professor of
political science; and George
Herrmann, professor of applied
mechanics and civil engineering.
Amsterdam, 33, on leave from
the University of Pennsylvania
Law School to serve as an
attorney with the NAACP's
Defense and Educational Fund
Inc., is regarded as one of the
outstanding legal educators in the
nation, according to Dean Bayless
Manning of Stanford Law School.
Amsterdam has played a major
role in innovating litigation in the
criminal courts, and he will add
strength to the Law School's
specialists in criminal law.
Bonilla, 44, is a native of New
York City. He was graduated from
CCNY and earned his advanced
degrees from New York
University and Harvard.
He has been director of
communications research of
International Research Associates
and a researcher for American
Universities Field staff until
joining the MIT faculty in 1963.
He holds a degree in sociology
as well as in political science and
has had extensive overseas
research experience. His teaching
technique has involved his
students in the study of policy
problems, especially in those of
Latin America.
Herrmann,a native of Russia, is
48. He became a U.S. citizen in
1956 after lengthy residence in
Switzerland.
He has been a professor at
Northwestern University since
1962, where has has held the
endowed Walter P. Murphy
distinguished professorship.
In the words of Dean Joseph
H. Pettit of Stanford's School of
Engineering, Prof. Herrmann
bridges the gap between applied
mechanics and structural
engineering, through his own
research and his editing of the
International Journal of Solids
and Structures.
• Talking Computers
Research has already started at
Stanford on how to develop a
talking computer, but the teacher
is a long way from becoming
obsolete, participants in the
annual School Planning Institute
learned last week.
Speakers included Prof. Robert
N. Bush, director of the School of
Education's Research and
Development Center, Prof. Patrick
Suppres, director of curriculum
research in the Honolulu city
schools. •
Suppes revealed he had
received a grant just a week ago to
begin research on a computer

which can communicate audibly
with the student as well as by
teletype, which is the case at
present.
He discussed computer-assisted
instruction informally with the
200 delegates to the 19th annual
event, sponsored by the Stanford
School of Education and the
School Planning Laboratory.
John Dewey's ideal of
individual instruction was realized
by computer-assisted instruction,
Prof. Suppes said, because the
computer can devote its individual
attention to 150 students at once
in a micro-second (one millionth
of a second) so vast are its
electronic capabilities.
He predicted that in 15 years
or so, the computer might be able
to communicate verbally with
students, answering substantive
questions.
Bush, however, predicted that
education, the schools and the
teachers themselves will become
more, not less important, in
coming decades.
Schools, he said, will become
more integrated with the
community than ever before,
because "more people will be in
school taking more things for a
longer time."
Curricula will become
"exciting new tools" for teaching,
he predicted, because of the
wealth of new instructional
materials coming from research
and development, and computers
will become a major factor in
lifting clerical burdens from the
backs of teachers, as well as
assisting in instruction and
scheduling.
Teachers will be used
differently, and more teaching
aides and paraprofessionals will
appear in the classroom. There
will be a trend to smaller classes,
more individualized instruction,
and the teacher himself will
become a more professionalized
person on the level of a lawyer or a
doctor, Bush prophesied.
• Admissions
Dr. Stirling L. Huntley,
associate director of admissions at
Stanford, has been appointed
director of admissions at the
East-West Center, University of
Hawaii, Honolulu, it was
announced in Honolulu.
He takes over his new position
Sept. 1.
Dr. Huntley, a graduate of
UCLA and a native of Riverside,
earned his doctorate in speech and
drama at Stanford in 1955.
He served as an assistant
professor of speech and drama for
two years, then joined the
admissions office staff in 1958.
He was appointed associate
director in 1960.
• School Curriculum
No changes will be made in
American school curriculum
unless you can assure the teachers
involved that their jobs are secure.

This flat dictum was laid before
the 19th annual School Planning
Institute last Tuesday by Prof.
William Georgeades, chairman of
University of Southern
California's Department of
Education and consultant to
many school districts.
"Desirable curriculum changes
