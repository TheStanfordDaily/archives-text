# An Interview
## Dave Harris Faces Jail 
### 
On May 27, former Stanford
student body president and
founder of the Resistance David
Harris was found guilty of
refusing induction into the army
of the United States, and
sentenced to three years
imprisonment.
Last month, Judge Benjamin
Duniway—a Stanford
trustee—rejected Harris' last
appeal. Expecting Harris to turn
himself in voluntarily, authorities
issued no warrant for his arrest.
They have since been told that
Harris will offer them as little
cooperation as he did to the
Selective Service System.
Dave Harris expects to be
arrested sometime today.
Yesterday evening, Daily
editors Bill Evers and Marshall
Schwartz interviewed Harris about
his upcoming imprisonment and
his recent activity.

"I've never been able to behave
in one place for three years in my
entire life. I don't see myself as a
good prisoner." Given this fact
about Harris, the news that he
plans to continue organizing while
in jail is no surprise at all.
Organize a jail? "We have to do
it wherever we are. So if we are in
jail, we have to have the
revolution in jail. Prisons are
really run by prisoners. Their
cooperation makes the system
work. If the prisoners refuse to
run the prisons, then they just
won't run. I set out with the
specific intent to destroy the
prison system."
This new task which awaits
him follows his completion of
another job he had never tackled
before—this time, it was writing a
book. Harris' just-finished
manuscript is called Goliath,
which he describes as "political
theory kind of stuff," and will be
published in the fall.
Where does his political
philosophy lie? A long way from
his early days at Stanford, when
he described himself as "a
moderate Democrat." Now, he
bases his position on a synthesis
of three philosophies: anarchism
(opposition to the centralized and

authoritarian state), communism
(opposition to private property
and capitalism), and pacifism
(opposition to violence).
Eldridge Cleaver left the
country when faced with a jail
term. But not Harris. "I'm going
to jail because I feel it's the best
alternative, because it allows me
to keep on doing what I want to
do. Also, because openness and
honesty requires it. Hiding creates
a political dynamic in which what
makes up a revolution can be
destroyed."
Although he did not
participate much in April Third
Movement activities—"lt would
really be a farce for me to pass
myself off as a member of the
Stanford community ."—he liked
the way it operated and "had a lot

of close friends" in it. His
travel—he has made 900 speeches
and covered more than 100,000
miles in the past two years—and
his writing also made participation
difficult.
And his work for the past two
years? "What people ought to
really understand is that the only
way America is going to be
stopped is if we are going to stop
it ourselves. To do this is to
understand that a price must be
paid. And I am paying that price
by going to prison. I consider it
really small compared to what I
hope will come out of this."
And finally, to those who will
miss him for the next three years:
"I'll catch them a little later down
the line."

he described himself as "a
moderate Democrat." Now, he
bases his position on a synthesis
of three philosophies: anarchism
(opposition to the centralized and

authoritarian state), communism
(opposition to private property
and capitalism), and pacifism
(opposition to violence).
Eldridge Cleaver left the
country when faced with a jail
term. But not Harris. "I'm going
to jail because I feel it's the best
alternative, because it allows me
to keep on doing what I want to
do. Also, because openness and
honesty requires it. Hiding creates
a political dynamic in which what
makes up a revolution can be
destroyed."
Although he did not
participate much in April Third
Movement activities—"lt would
really be a farce for me to pass
myself off as a member of the
Stanford community ."—he liked
the way it operated and "had a lot

of close friends" in it. His
travel—he has made 900 speeches
and covered more than 100,000
miles in the past two years—and
his writing also made participation
difficult.
And his work for the past two
years? "What people ought to
really understand is that the only
way America is going to be
stopped is if we are going to stop
it ourselves. To do this is to
understand that a price must be
paid. And I am paying that price
by going to prison. I consider it
really small compared to what I
hope will come out of this."
And finally, to those who will
miss him for the next three years:
"I'll catch them a little later down
the line."
On May 27, former Stanford
student body president and
founder of the Resistance David
Harris was found guilty of
refusing induction into the army
of the United States, and
sentenced to three years
imprisonment.
Last month, Judge Benjamin
Duniway—a Stanford
trustee—rejected Harris' last
appeal. Expecting Harris to turn
himself in voluntarily, authorities
issued no warrant for his arrest.
They have since been told that
Harris will offer them as little
cooperation as he did to the
Selective Service System.
Dave Harris expects to be
arrested sometime today.
Yesterday evening, Daily
editors Bill Evers and Marshall
Schwartz interviewed Harris about
his upcoming imprisonment and
his recent activity.

"I've never been able to behave
in one place for three years in my
entire life. I don't see myself as a
good prisoner." Given this fact
about Harris, the news that he
plans to continue organizing while
in jail is no surprise at all.
Organize a jail? "We have to do
it wherever we are. So if we are in
jail, we have to have the
revolution in jail. Prisons are
really run by prisoners. Their
cooperation makes the system
work. If the prisoners refuse to
run the prisons, then they just
won't run. I set out with the
specific intent to destroy the
prison system."
This new task which awaits
him follows his completion of
another job he had never tackled
before—this time, it was writing a
book. Harris' just-finished
manuscript is called Goliath,
which he describes as "political
theory kind of stuff," and will be
published in the fall.
Where does his political
philosophy lie? A long way from
his early days at Stanford, when
he described himself as "a
moderate Democrat." Now, he
bases his position on a synthesis
of three philosophies: anarchism
(opposition to the centralized and

authoritarian state), communism
(opposition to private property
and capitalism), and pacifism
