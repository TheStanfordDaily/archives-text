# Bastille Day Battle In Berkeley Streets
## 
### 
Street people celebrated
Bastille Day yesterday by battling
police from noon on into the
evening.
The Berkeley police
department had not been
expecting anything much. In the
morning, there were a few Burns
detectives inside People's Park,
and a few University of California
police (Uni cops) outside guarding
the cyclone fence.
Around noon about a thousand
people had gathered in the area
surrounding People's Park. They
milled around. People would take
some form of action against the
police, violent or non-violent, and

then the police would take action
against them. The demonstrators
were in no sense prepared only for
non-violent protest. They seemed
prepared to fight back against the
police.
Police lines were relatively
thin. The crowd was able to
approach the fence with
wire-cutters and cut sections out
of the chain link barrier. When
people shook the fence or cut
holes, the police would try to
repel them, but then a group
would attack the lence
somewhere else.
Vulnerable Police Car
Street people found a
vulnerable parked police car and
began trying to rock the car and
open its doors. Then, around 1:45
or 2 o'clock, Lieutenant
Schlinger, who was commanding
the Berkeley police forces on the
scene, tried to clear the sidewalks
in the area to free the parked
police car.
As the police moved, the park
supporters hurled rocks. Schlinger
told the crowd that if they didn't
stop throwing rocks, the police
would throw gas.
The police threw gas.
At this point the crowd was
split up. But fighting continued in
the streets in the area. Several
newspaper reporters were injured
during the melee, both by rock
and gas attacks.
The police attempted to sweep
the area. Their tactic was to try to
herd the demonstrators back onto
the UC campus. Once the
demonstrators were on the
campus, UC police came out of
the back of Sproul Hall and
cleared Sproul Plaza.
