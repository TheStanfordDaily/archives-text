# Bastille Day Battle In Berkeley Streets
## 
### 
Street people celebrated
Bastille Day yesterday by battling
police from noon on into the
evening.
The Berkeley police
department had not been
expecting anything much. In the
morning, there were a few Burns
detectives inside People's Park,
and a few University of California
police (Uni cops) outside guarding
the cyclone fence.
Around noon about a thousand
people had gathered in the area
surrounding People's Park. They
milled around. People would take
some form of action against the
police, violent or non-violent, and

then the police would take action
against them. The demonstrators
were in no sense prepared only for
non-violent protest. They seemed
prepared to fight back against the
police.
Police lines were relatively
thin. The crowd was able to
approach the fence with
wire-cutters and cut sections out
of the chain link barrier. When
people shook the fence or cut
holes, the police would try to
repel them, but then a group
would attack the lence
somewhere else.
Vulnerable Police Car
Street people found a
vulnerable parked police car and
began trying to rock the car and
open its doors. Then, around 1:45
or 2 o'clock, Lieutenant
Schlinger, who was commanding
the Berkeley police forces on the
scene, tried to clear the sidewalks
in the area to free the parked
police car.
As the police moved, the park
supporters hurled rocks. Schlinger
told the crowd that if they didn't
stop throwing rocks, the police
would throw gas.
The police threw gas.
At this point the crowd was
split up. But fighting continued in
the streets in the area. Several
newspaper reporters were injured
during the melee, both by rock
and gas attacks.
The police attempted to sweep
the area. Their tactic was to try to
herd the demonstrators back onto
the UC campus. Once the
demonstrators were on the
campus, UC police came out of
the back of Sproul Hall and
cleared Sproul Plaza.

Removed From Environs
As soon as people were
removed from the park environs,
UC maintenance crews went to
work to repair the fence. At 7:30
last night, it was reported that
Oakland police were guarding the
park, while Berkeley police,
Alameda sheriff's deputies, and
highway patrolmen cruised the
streets.
About 5 p.m., seventy-five to a
hundred people went back to the
park site. They milled around
across the street, as close as they
could get.
The police went into what they
call "Operation Snatch." This
means crowd control by arresting
as many people as possible. It is
carried out under Section 672 C of
the California Penal Code and
demonstrators were arrested for
"blocking a public street or
sidewalk."
At 8 o'clock there was a crowd
of 800 on Haste Street just west
of Cody's bookstore. They were
muttering about a police gas
attack on a medical clinic in
McKinley School (center for the
Telegraph Ave. Summer Program).
Dr. William E. Key said: "I yelled,

'Don't do this.' The police know
this is a medical clinic, not a
revolutionary hangout."
Caught Off Guard
Berkeley police admitted that
they were caught off guard and
that they thought the issue was
dead. The park leaders were
apparently pleasantly surprised
themselves that so many
demonstrators showed up.
One spokesman for those who
had planned yesterday's
demonstration said that the
purpose had been to show that
the fence was still up, reminding
people that James Rector had
died, and indicate the frustration
which park supporters felt after
every mechanism, from student
referenda to peaceful marches,
had been tired, and had failed.
The spokesman said that mass
demonstrations could not stop
now or it would show that the
fear which the police are trying to
instill had won out.
As of 8:45 last night The Daily
Californian at UC reported that 5
had been treated in hospitals.
Twenty-nine adults and two
juveniles had been arrested.

demonstration said that the
purpose had been to show that
the fence was still up, reminding
people that James Rector had
died, and indicate the frustration
which park supporters felt after
every mechanism, from student
referenda to peaceful marches,
had been tired, and had failed.
The spokesman said that mass
demonstrations could not stop
now or it would show that the
fear which the police are trying to
instill had won out.
As of 8:45 last night The Daily
Californian at UC reported that 5
had been treated in hospitals.
Twenty-nine adults and two
juveniles had been arrested.
Street people celebrated
Bastille Day yesterday by battling
police from noon on into the
evening.
The Berkeley police
department had not been
expecting anything much. In the
morning, there were a few Burns
detectives inside People's Park,
and a few University of California
police (Uni cops) outside guarding
the cyclone fence.
Around noon about a thousand
people had gathered in the area
surrounding People's Park. They
milled around. People would take
some form of action against the
police, violent or non-violent, and

then the police would take action
against them. The demonstrators
were in no sense prepared only for
non-violent protest. They seemed
prepared to fight back against the
police.
Police lines were relatively
thin. The crowd was able to
approach the fence with
wire-cutters and cut sections out
of the chain link barrier. When
people shook the fence or cut
holes, the police would try to
repel them, but then a group
would attack the lence
somewhere else.
Vulnerable Police Car
Street people found a
vulnerable parked police car and
began trying to rock the car and
open its doors. Then, around 1:45
or 2 o'clock, Lieutenant
Schlinger, who was commanding
the Berkeley police forces on the
scene, tried to clear the sidewalks
in the area to free the parked
police car.
As the police moved, the park
supporters hurled rocks. Schlinger
told the crowd that if they didn't
stop throwing rocks, the police
would throw gas.
The police threw gas.
At this point the crowd was
split up. But fighting continued in
the streets in the area. Several
newspaper reporters were injured
during the melee, both by rock
and gas attacks.
The police attempted to sweep
the area. Their tactic was to try to
herd the demonstrators back onto
the UC campus. Once the
demonstrators were on the
campus, UC police came out of
the back of Sproul Hall and
cleared Sproul Plaza.
Removed From Environs
As soon as people were
removed from the park environs,
UC maintenance crews went to
work to repair the fence. At 7:30
last night, it was reported that
Oakland police were guarding the
park, while Berkeley police,
Alameda sheriff's deputies, and
highway patrolmen cruised the
streets.
About 5 p.m., seventy-five to a
hundred people went back to the
park site. They milled around
across the street, as close as they
could get.
The police went into what they
call "Operation Snatch." This
means crowd control by arresting
as many people as possible. It is
carried out under Section 672 C of
the California Penal Code and
demonstrators were arrested for
"blocking a public street or
sidewalk."
At 8 o'clock there was a crowd
of 800 on Haste Street just west
of Cody's bookstore. They were
muttering about a police gas
attack on a medical clinic in
McKinley School (center for the
Telegraph Ave. Summer Program).
Dr. William E. Key said: "I yelled,

'Don't do this.' The police know
this is a medical clinic, not a
revolutionary hangout."
Caught Off Guard
Berkeley police admitted that
they were caught off guard and
that they thought the issue was
dead. The park leaders were
apparently pleasantly surprised
themselves that so many
demonstrators showed up.
One spokesman for those who
had planned yesterday's
demonstration said that the
purpose had been to show that
the fence was still up, reminding
people that James Rector had
died, and indicate the frustration
