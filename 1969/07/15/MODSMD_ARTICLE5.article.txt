# Summer Festival
## 'Jacques Brel' Opens Tonight 
### STEVEN UNGAR 
Elly Stone, a wonderfully
comic demure hellion, who The
New York Times says "sings with
the radiance of a Piaf," returns to
her starring role in the musical
"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well
and Living in Paris," which opens
tonight in Memorial Hall as part
of the 1969 Stanford Summer
Festival. The show, which is
described as a "new style
musical," will play at 8:00 p.m.
through Sunday night, with
matinees at 2:30 p.m. on
Saturday and Sunday.
The .Jacques Brel Show opened
in January 1968 at the Village
Gate Theater and is currently
running there. The play has also
been staged in London and
Philadelphia. Companies are
currently playing in Toronto and
Chicago. A Los Angeles run
preceded the Stanford
appearance.
Miss Stone, the original star of
the New York production, left the
role recently after 15 months to
record two solo albums for
Columbia. She returns to the
production tonight especially for
the Stanford performances.

Other Cast Members
Other members of the New
York cast in the Stanford Festival
performance include June Gable,
George Ball, and Robert
Guilaume.
The musical is based on 26
songs by the Belgian poet and
composer, Jacques Brel. Called
the "musical gem of the season"
by Billboard, the production
features Brel's highly melodic
songs ranging from sentimental
ballads to sardonic commentary.
The lyrics are about bulls, a
statue, a carousel, a death, and an
old soldier who drinks to the
health of all the whores in
Amsterdam.
Brel writes about the human
condition with a fierce honesty
that suggests not only Kurt Weill
but sometimes John Lennon and
Paul McCartney in their more
lyrical vein, according to Clive
Barnes of The New York Times.
Adapted And Translated
Brel's songs have been adapted
;nd translated into English by
Eric Blau and Mort Shuman. Blau,
a veteran stage and screen writer,
discovered Brel when Brel was a
favorite troubadour in the Paris

cafes and music halls. "His music
knocked me over," says Blau, a
skeptical realist from Bridgeport,
Conn., who has spent a good part
of his life promoting sports events
and ghosting articles bv eminent
sports figures.

ELI-Y STONE, a dcnrnr h oil ion with
the radiance of a Pitt', r«ar of the
musical "Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well
and Living in Paris."
Of Brel's 1965 American debut
at Carnegie Hall, The New York
Times wrote, "Brel burst upon the
American scene with all the
excitement of an electrical storm
and left the audience limp and in
awe of an extraordinary talent."
Brel made a second appearance in
1967, but has not returned to the
United States since that time.
While Brel is still in Paris, his
music is here. Elly Stone, his
greatest interpretor, is one of
today's great musical stars. She
began her career as a folk singer,
accompanying herself on the
guitar, and was an instant hit on
the coast-to-coast college circuit.
She later appeared as the star of
"O Oysters," a musical in which
she introduced "Marieke,"
probably the most famous Brel
song, and one featured in the
production.

Moni Yakim, the show's
director, is a Israeli actor-director
and celebrated mime. Speaking
fluent English, French, Hebrew,
and Arabic, he plies a
three-cornered world from Europe
to Israel to the United States,
appearing in all three in theater
and television—everything from
"Barefoot in the Park" to
Shakespeare.

He has directed a number of
mid-West repertory theaters
during the past year and is a
permanent teacher at the Stella
Adler Theater Studio and the
Drama Division of the Julliard
School of Music.
Elly Stone will preside at an
audience briefing for the Jacques
Brel show Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
in the Tresidder Lounge.

United States since that time.
While Brel is still in Paris, his
music is here. Elly Stone, his
greatest interpretor, is one of
today's great musical stars. She
began her career as a folk singer,
accompanying herself on the
guitar, and was an instant hit on
the coast-to-coast college circuit.
She later appeared as the star of
"O Oysters," a musical in which
she introduced "Marieke,"
probably the most famous Brel
song, and one featured in the
production.

Moni Yakim, the show's
director, is a Israeli actor-director
and celebrated mime. Speaking
fluent English, French, Hebrew,
and Arabic, he plies a
three-cornered world from Europe
to Israel to the United States,
appearing in all three in theater
and television—everything from
"Barefoot in the Park" to
Shakespeare.

He has directed a number of
mid-West repertory theaters
during the past year and is a
permanent teacher at the Stella
Adler Theater Studio and the
Drama Division of the Julliard
School of Music.
Elly Stone will preside at an
audience briefing for the Jacques
Brel show Thursday at 4:30 p.m.
in the Tresidder Lounge.
Elly Stone, a wonderfully
comic demure hellion, who The
New York Times says "sings with
the radiance of a Piaf," returns to
her starring role in the musical
"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well
and Living in Paris," which opens
tonight in Memorial Hall as part
of the 1969 Stanford Summer
Festival. The show, which is
described as a "new style
musical," will play at 8:00 p.m.
through Sunday night, with
matinees at 2:30 p.m. on
Saturday and Sunday.
The .Jacques Brel Show opened
in January 1968 at the Village
Gate Theater and is currently
running there. The play has also
been staged in London and
Philadelphia. Companies are
currently playing in Toronto and
Chicago. A Los Angeles run
preceded the Stanford
appearance.
Miss Stone, the original star of
the New York production, left the
role recently after 15 months to
record two solo albums for
Columbia. She returns to the
production tonight especially for
the Stanford performances.

Other Cast Members
Other members of the New
York cast in the Stanford Festival
performance include June Gable,
George Ball, and Robert
Guilaume.
The musical is based on 26
songs by the Belgian poet and
composer, Jacques Brel. Called
the "musical gem of the season"
by Billboard, the production
features Brel's highly melodic
songs ranging from sentimental
ballads to sardonic commentary.
The lyrics are about bulls, a
statue, a carousel, a death, and an
old soldier who drinks to the
health of all the whores in
Amsterdam.
Brel writes about the human
condition with a fierce honesty
that suggests not only Kurt Weill
but sometimes John Lennon and
Paul McCartney in their more
lyrical vein, according to Clive
Barnes of The New York Times.
Adapted And Translated
Brel's songs have been adapted
;nd translated into English by
Eric Blau and Mort Shuman. Blau,
a veteran stage and screen writer,
discovered Brel when Brel was a
favorite troubadour in the Paris

cafes and music halls. "His music
knocked me over," says Blau, a
skeptical realist from Bridgeport,
Conn., who has spent a good part
of his life promoting sports events
and ghosting articles bv eminent
sports figures.
