# Resistance

### 
Today David Harris, former ASSU President, expects to be arrested
and jailed for refusing to be inducted into the U.S. armed forces.
Harris has devoted almost all his time to anti-draft movement since
he resigned in 1967 as Stanford student body president. His
incarceration by federal authorities will come as no surprise. For several
years Harris has been calling on others to join him in going to jail. The
political strategy of the Resistance, the anti-draft organization to which
be belongs, has been to actualize the old revolutionary slogan: "Fill the
jails!"
If enough persons arc willing to go to jail as political prisoners, the
legitimacy accorded to the government by the people will shrivel. Then
the threatened government must repeal the unjust laws or face
revolution.
The Resistance itself is in the tradition of "absolutist" conscientious
objection to warâ€”refusal to cooperate with the conscription mechanism
in any way. Members have carried on the burning of draft cards begun
by the pacifist Catholic Worker Movement. These symbolic acts have
been recognized in federal law as dangerously subversive of the
sovereign political authorities.
Draft resistance is an act of lese tnajeste which has a parallel in
Henry David Thoreau's refusal to pay taxes to support the
Mexican-American War. Both strike at the basis of state power: the
ability of a government to impose its levies on the resources of a
society.
Draft resistance is also important as a form of extra-parliamentary
opposition to the government. Instead of waiting to mark an "X" on a
ballot box every few years, draft resistcrs, faced with an unjust law,
refuse to disobey theirconsciences. They undermine the structures which
support manipulative democracy and going through channels. They
refuse to address petitions from below to the seat of power. They have
resolved to offer no more prayers to the unjust king.
David Harris has decided that the only way he can live honestly is
through non-violent direct action against the draft. We wish him well.
