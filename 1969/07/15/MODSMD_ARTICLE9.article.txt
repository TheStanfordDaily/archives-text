## Cable TV And Free Speech 
### Joshua Lederberg 
In related actions last December, the Federal
Communications Commission announced tentative
regulations for pay TV and for cable channels
(CATV). The guidelines for cable systems have since
been the subject of discussion, marked by partial
agreements recently among the TV networds and
CATV organizers.
Recently, the agreements have collapsed. The
tentative proposals would have restrained the cable
systems from forming a national network of their
own.
At stake is the allocation of a unique and limited
natural resource, the radio-spectrum.
The technology of spectrum management rests
on firmer scientific principles than that of the social
effects of mass media, but both need extensive
research for the best answers. Altogether,
communications comprise one of the most
important frontiers of science and policy today, and
a prototype for managing future scientific advances.
We are learning that we can manage
communications technology for better living, just as
we can ask questions about the internal combustion
engine or about pesticides.
Freedom of speech is a central issue, but too
often as a spurious confusion of the freedoms of the
licensed broadcaster with those of the public, which
is legally excluded from his channel. As FCC
Commissioner Nicholas Johnson has pointed out,
the censorship of program material would be the
most offensive and intrusive way to protect the
public interest in the use of the spectrum. But, he
continues, this must not deter the public and the
FCC from the most vigorous evaluation and

criticism of the actual use of a license.
The soundest assurance of free speech is to open
the channels to the widest possible extent. The
provisional rules for CATV include the exciting
opportunity to reserve channels for common carrier
use, making them available to all comers at
reasonable costs.
Broadcasting is full of ironies, but none is more
amusing than the contrast between a station's aim
to spread its signal as far as possible and its
resistance to anyone else's picking it up for further
spread. The broadcaster is, of course, afraid that
listeners might hire some one to filter out the ads
and relay only the program. This might become one
of the happy functions of pay TV, providing a
second way to support programs of wide interest.
Pay TV has been greeted like the work of the
devil by the established networks: it may set up a
yardstick of quality and an escape for a captive
audience. It might undermine the system of "free,"
or rather advertising-supported, programs.
The citizenry is, however, not so gullible as to
believe it ever gets anything for nothing. In his
penetrating study, "Television and Society," Harry
J. Skornia points out that the low-income budget is
now taxed to the tune of over $75 a year by the
costs of TV advertising, passed on in consumer
prices.
The consumer is paying the bill, and ought to
have a more direct voice in what it buys. His choice
should cover real alternatives, not just to whether
the clatter coming through the set is just within, or
far beyond, the margin of tolerance and sanity.
