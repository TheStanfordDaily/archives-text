# Harris Off To Jail; To Serve 3 Years
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
David Harris' long wait is over.
On Wednesday morning, he
was arrested by two federal
marshals and taken to San
Francisco County Jail.
He will soon be moved to
Stafford Federal Prison Camp in
southeastern Arizona, where the
former Stanford student body
president and founder of the
Resistance will serve a three-year
sentence for refusing induction
into the Army.
For more than a week Harris
and his wife, folksinger Joan Baez,
had been expecting the
government authorities to arrive
at their commune high in the
foothills overlooking Palo
Alto—ever since it became known
that Harris would not appeal his
conviction any further.
The government, however, had
been expecting that Harris would
turn himself in voluntarily. It was
not until early this week that they
were told he would not do so.

About two dozen friends and
reporters waited outside the
Harris' long, low, light green
frame house Tuesday morning,
but the marshals never came.
A smaller group was there
Wednesday awaiting the arrest.
"I feel like a vulture," one of
the girls there commented.
Normal activity in the
compound halted, when a call
came informing them that
marshals were on the way. Harris
and his wife strolled in and out of
their house, and at one point went
off by themselves down a dirt
path.
Shortly after 11 a.m., a
member of the Resistance roared
up on his motorcycle and called,
"They're two minutes behind
me."
He was accurate in his
estimation. At 11:10, a late-model
Oldsmobile pulled up, and two
nattily attired federal marshals
stepped out. They walked up to
the open door of the house and
knocked.
Joan asked them in, and shook
hands with the officers. "It's time
to go," one of them said.
Harris was gulping down a
high-protein drink his wife had
made for him.
"Let him finish his drink," she
asked the marshals. They
assented, but politely 'turned
down her offer of a cup of coffee,
saying they had to return by
noon.
Harris picked up his
ever-present denim jacket, and the
couple walked out of the house
hand in hand. As he passed
through the yard, Harris embraced
several members of the commune.
Finally, the marshals told him
to enter the car.
"Catch you later," he said to
his friends.
He was handcuffed after he
was in the automobile, and the
observers protested mildly.
"It's regulations," one of the
marshals said.
".Just doing your job?" Joan
asked. "Come back after you've
quit."
Then the car drove off—on the
wrong side of the road—sporting a
brand-new "Resist The Draft"
sticker on its back bumper, placed
there by a member of the
commune.

into the Army.
For more than a week Harris
and his wife, folksinger Joan Baez,
had been expecting the
government authorities to arrive
at their commune high in the
foothills overlooking Palo
Alto—ever since it became known
that Harris would not appeal his
conviction any further.
The government, however, had
been expecting that Harris would
turn himself in voluntarily. It was
not until early this week that they
were told he would not do so.

About two dozen friends and
reporters waited outside the
Harris' long, low, light green
frame house Tuesday morning,
but the marshals never came.
A smaller group was there
Wednesday awaiting the arrest.
"I feel like a vulture," one of
the girls there commented.
Normal activity in the
compound halted, when a call
came informing them that
marshals were on the way. Harris
and his wife strolled in and out of
their house, and at one point went
off by themselves down a dirt
path.
Shortly after 11 a.m., a
member of the Resistance roared
up on his motorcycle and called,
"They're two minutes behind
me."
He was accurate in his
estimation. At 11:10, a late-model
Oldsmobile pulled up, and two
nattily attired federal marshals
stepped out. They walked up to
the open door of the house and
knocked.
Joan asked them in, and shook
hands with the officers. "It's time
to go," one of them said.
Harris was gulping down a
high-protein drink his wife had
made for him.
"Let him finish his drink," she
asked the marshals. They
assented, but politely 'turned
down her offer of a cup of coffee,
saying they had to return by
noon.
Harris picked up his
ever-present denim jacket, and the
couple walked out of the house
hand in hand. As he passed
through the yard, Harris embraced
several members of the commune.
Finally, the marshals told him
to enter the car.
"Catch you later," he said to
his friends.
He was handcuffed after he
was in the automobile, and the
observers protested mildly.
"It's regulations," one of the
marshals said.
".Just doing your job?" Joan
asked. "Come back after you've
quit."
Then the car drove off—on the
wrong side of the road—sporting a
brand-new "Resist The Draft"
sticker on its back bumper, placed
there by a member of the
commune.

CATCH YOU LATER-Draft resister David Harris is taken to jail by two federal marshals, one at left and one behind Harris's
shoulder. His wife Joan Baez, who expects the couple's first child in early December, is at right.

David Harris' long wait is over.
On Wednesday morning, he
was arrested by two federal
marshals and taken to San
Francisco County Jail.
He will soon be moved to
Stafford Federal Prison Camp in
southeastern Arizona, where the
former Stanford student body
president and founder of the
Resistance will serve a three-year
sentence for refusing induction
into the Army.
