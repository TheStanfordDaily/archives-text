## Jacques Brel Is Alive, But... 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
I didn't particularly like
"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well
and Living In Paris." I realize that
in the minds of some people I
have just branded myself as an
insensitive boor, but there's
nothing I can do about it. I tried
to like it. I tried to whip up an
enthusiasm as great as that of the
gentleman sitting behind me who
yelled bravo no fewer than eight
times during the second act. I
tried to become as excited as
some of my neighbors who
applauded madly after each song.
But, alas, my efforts were all for
naught: I still didn't like "Jacques
Brel . .
This is not to say that I
disliked "Jacques Brel . . not at
all. I just couldn't get interested
enough in it to care one way or
the other. It wasn't boring, or
marked by bad acting, or stagnent
directing, or poor musicianship. In
fact, technically it was quite good,
with exciting lighting effects and
splendid performances.
Nevertheless, for me, at any rate,
there was very little to find in the
show.
Let me explain what "Jacques
Brel . . is all about. Jacques Brel
is a real person, a Belgian
composer now living in Paris, who
has made several appearances at
Carnegie Hall in New York. This
play is a collection of his songs,
performed by four young singers,
accompanied by a four man, ten
piece band. The set is simple and
abstract, the dialogue between
numbers is almost nonexistent.
Let's fact it: What it all comes
down to is that I don't like
Jacques Brel's songs. There's
really nothing else to the
show . . .it is Jacques Brel's songs,
and if you don't like the songs
you are really fighting an uphill
battle in any effort to appreciate
the show in a larger sense. Of the
twenty-five musical numbers, I
very much enjoyed three or four,
was rather unhappy about an
equal number, and couldn't care
less about the rest. That left me
free to watch James Nisbet Clark's
beautiful lighting, read my
program, appreciate the acting,
and listen to the beautiful voices
(without bothering about the
lyrics). I'm sorry folks, but there
are also people who don't like
Verdi or Cole Porter; I guess I
don't like Jacques Brel.

Well, what does this show offer
to confirmed (or suspected)

"Jacques Brel Is Alive and Well and
Living in Paris"; Production
Conception, English Lyrics,
Additional Material by Eric Blau and
Mort Shuman; Based on Brel's Lyrics
& Commentary; Music by Jacques
Brel; Directed by Moni Yakim;
Musical Direction by Mort Shuman;
Consultant to the Producers: Nat
Shapiro; Music Arranged and
Conducted by Wolfgang Knittel;
Production Supervised by Eric Blau;
in Memorial Hall, with the following
cast: Elly Stone, Robert Guillaume,
George Ball and June Gable;
alternates: M. Jay Johnson and Teri
Ralston.

Brelophobes? Not much, as I
indicated earlier, but what little is
left quite nice. Elly Stone, Robert
Guillaume, George Ball, and June
Gable are all fine performers, with
strong, resonant voices and great
stage presence. They did more
than sing the songsâ€”they acted
them, and very well. I was
particularly impressed by George
Ball and Robert Guillaume, and I
wish that June Gable had been
given more to do, as she was very
appealing in the ensemble

numbers. Elly Stone was a bit of a
disappointment, but this was
probably as much a problem of
material as anything else. Her
performance of "Old Folks" was
very moving, one of the few
moments when the show actually
reached me.
The music was well played, but
the orchestra was much too loud.
The show plays at the Village
Gate in New York, which is about
the size of the Tresidder Coffee
House. Memorial Auditorium,
which holds about 1750, was
picked by the Summer Festival
for the Stanford run. The sound is
so heavily amplified that the
theater reverbs like Yankee
Stadium, and the stage drips
microphone cables like stalagtites.
The effect varies from pleasing
resonance to total cacophony,
depending largely (as determined
by discrete questioning during the
intermission) on where you
happen to be sitting. Some win,
some lose.
So, it finally comes down to
this: If you like Jacques Brel,
you'll love this show; if you don't,
you won't. Very simple. More I
cannot tell you.


SURPRISE!-George Ball, June Gable,
IJIy Stone, and Robert Guillaumc in
"Jacques Brel."
