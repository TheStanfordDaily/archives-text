# Sounds Like Summer
## The 						Soul Of New Orleans 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
New Orleans Jazz is music
which must be felt as well as
heard, for it is the creation of the
soul, not the composition of the
intellect. This jazz springs from
the vitality of those who live it
and play it, those few left whose
years have been filledwith the beat
and the blast of traditional
Dixieland.
Billie and DeDe Pierce are two
who have lived the life they sing
about, and each Tuesday through
Saturday night at 8:30 and 10:30
they and their Preservation Hall
Jazz Band share their love for the
soul of New Orleans with Summer
Festival audiences.
Their unfamiliar musical
language is misunderstood at first..
It is not smooth and polished, it is
not even always in tune or in
time. But this is the real music of
real people, the last people who
grew up playing and singing this
music. Soon the crowd begins to
come alive with shouts and cheers
and spontaneous applause.
The ebullence of impish little
DeDe and the enthusiasm of
bouncy Willie Humphrey arc
infectious. The rapport grows as
blues give way to struts and rags,
and the audience is treated to a
glimpse of true joy and
excitement.
The mood is reaching its peak
when the Band launches into
Saints (their least favorite
number, since it is requested so
often), the audience goes wild,
and the gig is over. Neither
audience nor musicians seem
happy with this farced and
premature cut-off, and I too was
disappointed in the Summer
Festival scheduling.
It is true that the Band is
playing two shows each night, but
once a good jazz stand gets going,
it usually lasts all night anyway.
This music developed as
entertainment for those who
made it themselves, and the best
jazz is still that which jazzmen
play to each other.
But restricting music to
musicians would be the height of

selfishness, and this music is too
full of life and freedom to be
bottled up and hidden. The
audience, then, must become
absorbed in the aura about the
stage, and the musicians must
push the stage back beyond the
walls.
The members of the PHJB have
been pushing back walls for years,
their audiences this past week
would have clambered up beside
them if it were possible.
Good jazz and good crowds
made a heady brew. Come to a
PHJB show tonight, tomorrow or
next week and share some good
time sounds with the folks who
know how to make them.

Tonight is the last performance
on campus of the New York Pro
Musica, which will present a
program of Medieval music at 8
PM in Dinkelspiel. The Pro
Musica's last performance was of
Italian courtly music of the Late
Renaissance, and although it was
good, I felt the audience was a bit
over-enthusiastic. I was not quite
so pleased, and the group's
expressions indicated that they
weren't either.
Coming on-stage in modern
dress, carrying their ancient
instruments and looking like
characters from al old Alec
Guinness movie, the Pro Musica
sat patiently and tuned up a bit,
awaiting the entrance of Mother.
And then John Reeves White, the
musical director of the group,
sweeps out onto the stage like a
Miami emcee, and conducts his
group of eleven as if this were the
Royal Fireworks.
As before, when the group
presented the Masque "An
Entertainment for Elizabeth," the
two most talented performers
were Arthur Burrows, the
bass-baritone, and Shelley
Gruskin, master of an entire
catalogue of early instruments,
including the transverse flute,
rauschpfeifes, recorders and
krummhorns. The group as a
whole was good, but these two
men gave the evening a sparkle

which it would have lacked
without them.
Tonight's performance will
certainly be worth attending,
since only rarely is Medieval music
performed at all, and less often is
it performed competently.
Regardless of its occasional faults,
the New York Pro Musica is by far
the most talented of any group
today which performs pre-classical
music.

And then John Reeves White, the
musical director of the group,
sweeps out onto the stage like a
Miami emcee, and conducts his
group of eleven as if this were the
Royal Fireworks.
As before, when the group
presented the Masque "An
Entertainment for Elizabeth," the
two most talented performers
were Arthur Burrows, the
bass-baritone, and Shelley
Gruskin, master of an entire
catalogue of early instruments,
including the transverse flute,
rauschpfeifes, recorders and
krummhorns. The group as a
whole was good, but these two
men gave the evening a sparkle

which it would have lacked
without them.
Tonight's performance will
certainly be worth attending,
since only rarely is Medieval music
performed at all, and less often is
it performed competently.
Regardless of its occasional faults,
the New York Pro Musica is by far
the most talented of any group
today which performs pre-classical
music.
New Orleans Jazz is music
which must be felt as well as
heard, for it is the creation of the
soul, not the composition of the
intellect. This jazz springs from
the vitality of those who live it
and play it, those few left whose
years have been filledwith the beat
and the blast of traditional
Dixieland.
Billie and DeDe Pierce are two
who have lived the life they sing
about, and each Tuesday through
Saturday night at 8:30 and 10:30
they and their Preservation Hall
Jazz Band share their love for the
soul of New Orleans with Summer
Festival audiences.
Their unfamiliar musical
language is misunderstood at first..
It is not smooth and polished, it is
not even always in tune or in
time. But this is the real music of
real people, the last people who
grew up playing and singing this
music. Soon the crowd begins to
come alive with shouts and cheers
and spontaneous applause.
The ebullence of impish little
DeDe and the enthusiasm of
bouncy Willie Humphrey arc
infectious. The rapport grows as
blues give way to struts and rags,
and the audience is treated to a
glimpse of true joy and
excitement.
The mood is reaching its peak
when the Band launches into
Saints (their least favorite
number, since it is requested so
often), the audience goes wild,
and the gig is over. Neither
audience nor musicians seem
happy with this farced and
premature cut-off, and I too was
disappointed in the Summer
Festival scheduling.
It is true that the Band is
playing two shows each night, but
once a good jazz stand gets going,
it usually lasts all night anyway.
This music developed as
entertainment for those who
made it themselves, and the best
jazz is still that which jazzmen
play to each other.
But restricting music to
musicians would be the height of

selfishness, and this music is too
full of life and freedom to be
bottled up and hidden. The
audience, then, must become
absorbed in the aura about the
stage, and the musicians must
push the stage back beyond the
walls.
The members of the PHJB have
been pushing back walls for years,
their audiences this past week
would have clambered up beside
them if it were possible.
Good jazz and good crowds
made a heady brew. Come to a
PHJB show tonight, tomorrow or
next week and share some good
time sounds with the folks who
know how to make them.

Tonight is the last performance
on campus of the New York Pro
Musica, which will present a
program of Medieval music at 8
PM in Dinkelspiel. The Pro
Musica's last performance was of
Italian courtly music of the Late
Renaissance, and although it was
good, I felt the audience was a bit
over-enthusiastic. I was not quite
so pleased, and the group's
expressions indicated that they
weren't either.
Coming on-stage in modern
dress, carrying their ancient
instruments and looking like
characters from al old Alec
Guinness movie, the Pro Musica
sat patiently and tuned up a bit,
awaiting the entrance of Mother.
