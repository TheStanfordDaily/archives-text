• Stanf ord-In-Spaee
The voice at NASA's Mission
Control Center heard talking with
moon-bound Apollo 11 astronauts
is that of Astronaut Bruce
McCandless, one of two engineers
from Stanford University who
have joined the corps of spacemen
training here.
McCandless is the daytime
capsule communicator for Apollo
11. He was called to duty with the
space program in April, 1966, just
before he was due to finish studies
for a doctoral degree in electrical
engineering at Stanford. He
received a master's degree in
1965.
Stanford's other space corps
representative is electrical
engineering Prof. Owen K.
Garriott, one of the first

scientist-astronauts selected in
June 1965. Both men are still in
the program.
McCandless, a Navy officer, is
the son of retired Rear Admiral
and Mrs. Bruce McCandless of
Annapolis, Md. Young
McCandless attended high school
in Long Beach, and graduated
from the U.S. Naval Academy in
1958.
His Stanford faculty adviser
described the astronaut as a "star
pupil" carrying an unusually
heavy course load. McCandless
needs only to write his
dissertation for the Ph.D. degree,
which it is understood he plans to
do eventyally.
• Tutoring Program
Thirty black, college students,
including about five from
Stanford, are participating in an
"each one teach one" Teen
Summer Project in East Palo Alto.
At present the program is
suffering some financial
difficulties.
The Teen Summer Project
started in the summer of 1965
and was at first financed by the
Office of Economic Opportunity.
But funds have been cut back.
In the Summer Project, each
morning the college students
teach 250 teenagers about black
history and literature at
Ravenswood High School. Then in
the afternoon, the teenagers teach
2,500 pre-schoolers to read. The
program is seen as embodying the
words of Mrs. Gertrude Wilkes of
the East Palo Alto Day School:
"Our kids can learn!"
Shirley Allen and Sandy Jones
of the Project told The Daily :
"Our Project was an idea. Now it
is a functioning reality which we
want to keep in action."
The Teen Summer Project will
have a table in White Plaza
starting today from 11 o'clock till
2 o'clock. Tax-deductible
donations will be accepted. In
addition, tickets for barbeque on

July 19 and a soul music concert
on July 20 will be sold.
• Drug Clinic
The Haight-Ashbury Drug
Clinic is still in operation, and is

the summer. Philip Zimbardo,
Stanford professor of psychology,
is working with the group. The

psychological assistance for
people with a drug habit.
Volunteers are wanted for one
evening's work a week—about
three hours—regularly for the
summer.

The Drug Treatment Center is

Several persons associated with

is that of Astronaut Bruce
McCandless, one of two engineers
from Stanford University who
have joined the corps of spacemen
training here.
McCandless is the daytime
capsule communicator for Apollo
11. He was called to duty with the
space program in April, 1966, just
before he was due to finish studies
for a doctoral degree in electrical
engineering at Stanford. He
received a master's degree in
1965.
Stanford's other space corps
representative is electrical
engineering Prof. Owen K.
Garriott, one of the first

scientist-astronauts selected in
June 1965. Both men are still in
the program.

the son of retired Rear Admiral
and Mrs. Bruce McCandless of
Annapolis, Md. Young

do eventyally.

Thirty black, college students,
