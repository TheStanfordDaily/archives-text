# High Schools To Be Visited
## 
### 
When classes resume across the
country early in September, about
600 high schools will be visited by
Stanford students in a new
program to illustrate and increase
the diversity of students who
come to the University.
Conducted by 95 volunteers in
cooperation with the Admissions
Office, the new student-to-student
program will describe recent
changes at the University and give
visitors a chance to learn more
about prospective freshmen. It
will reach into nearly every state
in the union.
Each volunteer will talk with
students and counselors in about
seven high schools near his home,
usually including the one from
which he graduated.
"Students can relate to
students much better than we
can," says Steve Hoglund,
assistant director of freshman
admissions who is not really that
old; he graduated from Stanford
in 1966.
"The most important thing
they are doing is being themselves.
They are not there to represent
the University as such, although
they will talk about it generally,
but rather to tell what they have
experienced at Stanford. To hear
about an overseas campus from
one who has been there is much
more valuable than reading a
pamphlet—but we'll provide
pamphlets, too."
Hoglund emphasized that the
student visitors will be
''communicators,'' not
"evaluators." Evaluation of
Stanford applicants will continue
to be done by the faculty
admissions committee, he said,
and members of the Admissions
Office will continue to visit high
schools themselves. But since
admissions officials can't possibly
visit all high schools, the students'
talks with counselors will help
spread the word about Stanford.
"We're specialists in finding
out about high school students,"
says Hoglund.
