# Small Protest Held At SRI
## 
### 
Marc Sapir, Marc Heller, and
Scott Johnson, members of the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), held a press conference at
the Menlo Park facility of the
Stanford Research Institute (SRI)
Wednesday to announce their
defiance of police warrants issued
for their arrest.
They told the group of about
35 persons gathered there,
including a few members of the
press, that they would not
voluntarily submit to arrest.
Heller had previously told the
Daily that the three expected to
be arrested during the protest
conference on misdemeanor
charges stemming from their
participation in the April 3rd
Movement's disruption of the
Hanover facility of SRI this
spring. But the police did not
appear.
During the press conference,
the • three were served with
temporary injunctions enjoining
them from entering SRI property.
Although the group ignored the
injunction and remained on SRI
property, the police were not
called in. An SRI official in charge
of security remarked that he saw
no need for this action. No
attempt was made to enter the
building.
Sapir announced SDS plans to
disrupt the International
Industrial Conference, held once
every four years, which is
scheduled for San Francisco in
September. He linked the
Wednesday protest at SRI with
the conference by pointing out
that SRI is one of its co-sponsors.
Sapir stated that warrants have
been issued for 75 members of the
A3M who participated in the
spring SRI disruption.
Johnson called the arrests an
example of "police facism."
