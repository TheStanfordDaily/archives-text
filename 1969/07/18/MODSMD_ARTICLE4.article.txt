## Dave Harris: Quiet Rebel 
### BILL EVERS 
On April 28, 1966, David
Harris, a junior in Stanford's
social thought program, was
elected ASSU president after a
campaign which had focused
largely on educational issues.
Harris had come to Stanford
from Fresno High School,
politically a moderate Democrat,
in practice almost apolitical. This
same David Harris has now been
jailed for resisting the draft.
The story of Harris and his
politics is an important part of the
history of radicalism at Stanford.
Of his ASSU administration, Tom
Forstenzer, former speaker of
LASSU, said: "If there are
watersheds or turning points in
the life of an institution, Dave
Harris's administration (was) one
for this university." In addition,
the Resistance, a political group
which Harris helped found,
remains a vital part of the
American radical movement.
In the fall of 1964, Harris went
to Mississippi as a SNCC volunteer
to register blacks for the Freedom
vote. In the summer of 1965, he
picketed the White House
protesting the Viet-Nam war, and
in 1966 he was an active campus
supporter of the Delano farm
workers' strike.
In the spring of 1966, Harris
ran for ASSU president with Mike
Collins as his running mate. Their
platform stressed increased
student participation in the
decisions affecting students' lives.
Among the reforms proposed
were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only
requirement for a B.A. the
completion of 180 units of work,
prescriptions for contraceptives at
the health center, and creating
coffee houses, book shops, and

theatres around the campus.
Harris criticized Stanford's first
sit-in, which lasted 50 hours in
May 1966 in the office of Wallace
Sterling, then President, now
Chancellorof the University. It was
sparked by the administration's
decision to hold qualifying
examinations for the Selective
Service System on the Stanford
campus. Harris said at the time
that there hadn't been even an
attempt to use established
channels of communication. He
spent many hours in efforts to
mediate. This was well received by
those who sat in, but the lack of
response from the administration
led Harris to join others in
charging the administration with
"intransigence."
In June 1966, Harris, as ASSU
president-elect, called a meeting
of students, faculty, and
administrators at Asilomar in
Pacific Grove to discuss
educational reform at Stanford.
At this conference there was talk
on such subjects as extension of
the then new pass-fail grading
option to the entire freshman year
and to courses taken in fulfillment
of general studies and major
requirements and "desegregating"
the all-freshman residences.
Harris headed the Stanford
delegation to the National
Student Association congress in
Illinois that summer. There the
Liberal Caucus failed to pass a
resolution sponsored mainly by
Harris calling for immediate
American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam and characterizing the
war as an attempt to further "the
American empire . . .in a
calculated barbaric
fashion . . .against the will of the
indiginous population."
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone debate
on an anti-draft resolution
proposed by Harris. Harris and
others walked out to form a
Radical Caucus. They felt that the
nature of politics being practiced
in the Liberal Caucus destroyed

serious political discussion.
During pre-registration week in
September, Harris told 1300
incoming students gathered in
Memorial Auditorium for
freshman convocation: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
On October 20, Harris was
attacked by a band of students
wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said

wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said
afterwards that some members of
his house viewed the shaving of
Harris's head as a serious protest
aimed at changing the image of
Stanford of which Harris was the
public's symbol. Others were
"simply caught up in the
spontaneity of the thing." He said
that for some the hair-cut was a
way of indicating opposition to
Harris's views on fraternities and
athletic scholarships.
During his administration
Harris clashed with LASSU over
his choice of student
appointments to the Committee
of 15, a top level negotiating
committee of students, faculty,
and administrators. He clashed
with the administration on such
issues as having a student-run
coffee house on campus and
allowing undergraduate women to
live off campus (Harris supported
a rent strike on the latter issue).
In early November 1966,
Harris clashed with the
administration over the naming of
students to serve on Presidential
committees. Harris termed the
committees "great miasmas of
psychic mud," but in what he
called an effort to make being a
student on a committee an
indication of constituency rather
than status. Harris nominated one
student for each opening instead
of following the time-honored
ground rules of "choose six get
three."
Harris told a noon rally in
White Plaza: "The key is not that
students serve on committees, but
that the mass thing called students
choose their own representa
tives ... .If we participate, we'll
go not as the guests of anybody,
but we'll go as representatives."
Harris later attacked the Study
of Education at Stanford, calling
it a "sophisticated whitewash"
with ''no democratic
participation" and wanted the
new ASSU Education Commission
to act as a parallel institution and
a watchdog to the study headed
by Vice-Provost Herbert Packer.
On October 12, 1966, at a
Quaker-sponsored forum on
conscientious objection, Harris
stated that he "did not accept the
mechanism of the draft at all." He
said that application for
conscientious objector status
implied that the draft board had
the right to make the decision.
Harris had sent his 11-S Student
classification back in July 1966.
On December 23, 1966, he was
classified I-A by his draft board.
He appealed for a I-O
conscientious objector
classification, while saying he was
not sure he would perform
alternate serivce. He commented,

"I am a conscientious objector,
but more of a conscientious
objector that the draft allows."
This application for CO status was
only a delaying tactic to allow
him to graduate before going to
jail. He took his physical
examination in Fresno in January.
But his draft board sent him a I-Y
deferment, lasting until
September 1967.
On January 12, 1967, at an
SDS noon rally in White Plaza
before 400 students, Harris
supported mass civil disobedience
of the draft laws. He called on
other students to refuse to be
drafted and to join him in jail.
Meanwhile the machinery of
the ASSU apparatus groun on.
When the ASSU Housing
Commission Report came out on
February 15, 1967, it was
dedicated to Dave Harris and to
Dr. Maurice Osborne, who then
headed the Cowell Health Center.
The "Wilbur experiment"
proposed in that report suggested
that in fall 1967 all the houses of
the Wilbur Hall dormitory
complex be integrated by sex and
by class. At that time, Wilbur
housed freshman class males.
The report dedication was
accompanied by the following
quotation from one-time UN
Secret ary - G e ner a 1 Dag
Hammarskjold, used by the
Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only
because he had the courage to go
ahead without asking whether
others were following or even
understood . . . ."
The next week, Harris resigned
as ASSU president, saying "I have
done all 1 am capable of doing for
the realization of education at
Stanford."

After Harris's resignation, one
of his aids, Tim Haight, wrote of
him in an opinion column in The
Daily: "He lacked the cynicism,
or sense of history, to be the
Machiavelli needed in the halls of
Space City Academe. He was not
a mediator-initiator. He was a
prophet. Perhaps the real failure
of his administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy."
Historian Staughton Lynd told
the Resistance national
conference in March 1969 that he
was "struck by the similarity
between David's reasons for
resigning his position as student
body president at Stanford and
(SNCC leader) Bob
(Moses-Parris)'s reasons for
fiercely refusing the charisma
thrust upon him. In each case, the
motivation is not guilt, but the
desire to enable others by
removing a personality, to oblige
others to improvise their own
militancy rather than deferring to
a leader."
In the spring of 1967 after his

resignation as ASSU president,
Harris joined with Dennis
Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.
In the course of two years,
Harris made 900 speeches for the
Resistance and traveled 100,000
miles. In one speech in 1967,
citing the Selective Service
System's pamphlet "Channeling"
as his authority, he told 400 Palo
Alto High School students: "The
primary purpose of military
conscription is not to induct
people into the military, but to
control the lives of the young
people of this country."
On Wednesday, October 18,
1967, Harris was arrested in front
of the Oakland Induction Center
on the third day of the Stop the
Draft Week demonstrations which
he had helped organize. He was
charged with trespassing,
disturbing the peace, and creating
a public nuisance. As a result of
this protest, he got to know
folksinger Joan Baez, to whom he

was married on March 26, 1968.
Harris refused induction into
the army on January 17, 1968, a
year and a half after first sending
in his draft card.
Of the subsequent trial which
resulted on May 29, 1968, in
Judge Oliver Carter sentencing
Harris to 3 years imprisonment,
Harris wrote: "What ought to be
decided in the process of justice is
the proper relationship of things,
the integration of a form. But the
trial held in the glory and polished
wood of the government's court,
began with a presumption. Justice
was being administered by the
state. Those who must execute
the decision of balance and
harmony that is justice felt an
allegiance not to justice, or the
lives justice must reconcile, but
the state. Justice became simply
the extension of an established
priority which made the decision
simply one of whether or not I,
and all that 1 stood representative
of, could ever be reconciled with
the state."

Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only
because he had the courage to go
ahead without asking whether
others were following or even
understood . . . ."
The next week, Harris resigned
as ASSU president, saying "I have
done all 1 am capable of doing for
the realization of education at
Stanford."

After Harris's resignation, one
of his aids, Tim Haight, wrote of
him in an opinion column in The
Daily: "He lacked the cynicism,
or sense of history, to be the
Machiavelli needed in the halls of
Space City Academe. He was not
a mediator-initiator. He was a
prophet. Perhaps the real failure
of his administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy."
Historian Staughton Lynd told
the Resistance national
conference in March 1969 that he
was "struck by the similarity
between David's reasons for
resigning his position as student
body president at Stanford and
(SNCC leader) Bob
(Moses-Parris)'s reasons for
fiercely refusing the charisma
thrust upon him. In each case, the
motivation is not guilt, but the
desire to enable others by
removing a personality, to oblige
others to improvise their own
militancy rather than deferring to
a leader."
In the spring of 1967 after his

resignation as ASSU president,
Harris joined with Dennis
Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.
In the course of two years,
Harris made 900 speeches for the
Resistance and traveled 100,000
miles. In one speech in 1967,
citing the Selective Service
System's pamphlet "Channeling"
as his authority, he told 400 Palo
Alto High School students: "The
primary purpose of military
conscription is not to induct
people into the military, but to
control the lives of the young
people of this country."
On Wednesday, October 18,
1967, Harris was arrested in front
of the Oakland Induction Center
on the third day of the Stop the
Draft Week demonstrations which
he had helped organize. He was
charged with trespassing,
disturbing the peace, and creating
a public nuisance. As a result of
this protest, he got to know
folksinger Joan Baez, to whom he

was married on March 26, 1968.
Harris refused induction into
the army on January 17, 1968, a
year and a half after first sending
in his draft card.
Of the subsequent trial which
resulted on May 29, 1968, in
Judge Oliver Carter sentencing
Harris to 3 years imprisonment,
Harris wrote: "What ought to be
decided in the process of justice is
the proper relationship of things,
the integration of a form. But the
trial held in the glory and polished
wood of the government's court,
began with a presumption. Justice
was being administered by the
state. Those who must execute
the decision of balance and
harmony that is justice felt an
allegiance not to justice, or the
lives justice must reconcile, but
the state. Justice became simply
the extension of an established
priority which made the decision
simply one of whether or not I,
and all that 1 stood representative
of, could ever be reconciled with
the state."
On April 28, 1966, David
Harris, a junior in Stanford's
social thought program, was
elected ASSU president after a
campaign which had focused
largely on educational issues.
Harris had come to Stanford
from Fresno High School,
politically a moderate Democrat,
in practice almost apolitical. This
same David Harris has now been
jailed for resisting the draft.
The story of Harris and his
politics is an important part of the
history of radicalism at Stanford.
Of his ASSU administration, Tom
Forstenzer, former speaker of
LASSU, said: "If there are
watersheds or turning points in
the life of an institution, Dave
Harris's administration (was) one
for this university." In addition,
the Resistance, a political group
which Harris helped found,
remains a vital part of the
American radical movement.
In the fall of 1964, Harris went
to Mississippi as a SNCC volunteer
to register blacks for the Freedom
vote. In the summer of 1965, he
picketed the White House
protesting the Viet-Nam war, and
in 1966 he was an active campus
supporter of the Delano farm
workers' strike.
In the spring of 1966, Harris
ran for ASSU president with Mike
Collins as his running mate. Their
platform stressed increased
student participation in the
decisions affecting students' lives.
Among the reforms proposed
were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only
requirement for a B.A. the
completion of 180 units of work,
prescriptions for contraceptives at
the health center, and creating
coffee houses, book shops, and

theatres around the campus.
Harris criticized Stanford's first
sit-in, which lasted 50 hours in
May 1966 in the office of Wallace
Sterling, then President, now
Chancellorof the University. It was
sparked by the administration's
decision to hold qualifying
examinations for the Selective
Service System on the Stanford
campus. Harris said at the time
that there hadn't been even an
attempt to use established
channels of communication. He
spent many hours in efforts to
mediate. This was well received by
those who sat in, but the lack of
response from the administration
led Harris to join others in
charging the administration with
"intransigence."
In June 1966, Harris, as ASSU
president-elect, called a meeting
of students, faculty, and
administrators at Asilomar in
Pacific Grove to discuss
educational reform at Stanford.
At this conference there was talk
on such subjects as extension of
the then new pass-fail grading
option to the entire freshman year
and to courses taken in fulfillment
of general studies and major
requirements and "desegregating"
the all-freshman residences.
Harris headed the Stanford
delegation to the National
Student Association congress in
Illinois that summer. There the
Liberal Caucus failed to pass a
resolution sponsored mainly by
Harris calling for immediate
American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam and characterizing the
war as an attempt to further "the
American empire . . .in a
calculated barbaric
fashion . . .against the will of the
indiginous population."
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone debate
on an anti-draft resolution
proposed by Harris. Harris and
others walked out to form a
Radical Caucus. They felt that the
nature of politics being practiced
in the Liberal Caucus destroyed

serious political discussion.
During pre-registration week in
September, Harris told 1300
incoming students gathered in
Memorial Auditorium for
freshman convocation: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
On October 20, Harris was
attacked by a band of students
wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said
afterwards that some members of
his house viewed the shaving of
Harris's head as a serious protest
aimed at changing the image of
Stanford of which Harris was the
public's symbol. Others were
"simply caught up in the
spontaneity of the thing." He said
that for some the hair-cut was a
way of indicating opposition to
Harris's views on fraternities and
athletic scholarships.
During his administration
Harris clashed with LASSU over
his choice of student
appointments to the Committee
of 15, a top level negotiating
committee of students, faculty,
and administrators. He clashed
with the administration on such
issues as having a student-run
coffee house on campus and
allowing undergraduate women to
live off campus (Harris supported
a rent strike on the latter issue).
In early November 1966,
Harris clashed with the
administration over the naming of
students to serve on Presidential
committees. Harris termed the
committees "great miasmas of
psychic mud," but in what he
called an effort to make being a
student on a committee an
indication of constituency rather
than status. Harris nominated one
student for each opening instead
of following the time-honored
ground rules of "choose six get
three."
Harris told a noon rally in
White Plaza: "The key is not that
students serve on committees, but
that the mass thing called students
choose their own representa
tives ... .If we participate, we'll
go not as the guests of anybody,
but we'll go as representatives."
Harris later attacked the Study
of Education at Stanford, calling
it a "sophisticated whitewash"
with ''no democratic
participation" and wanted the
new ASSU Education Commission
to act as a parallel institution and
a watchdog to the study headed
by Vice-Provost Herbert Packer.
On October 12, 1966, at a
Quaker-sponsored forum on
conscientious objection, Harris
stated that he "did not accept the
mechanism of the draft at all." He
said that application for
conscientious objector status
implied that the draft board had
the right to make the decision.
Harris had sent his 11-S Student
classification back in July 1966.
On December 23, 1966, he was
classified I-A by his draft board.
He appealed for a I-O
conscientious objector
classification, while saying he was
not sure he would perform
alternate serivce. He commented,

"I am a conscientious objector,
but more of a conscientious
objector that the draft allows."
This application for CO status was
only a delaying tactic to allow
him to graduate before going to
jail. He took his physical
examination in Fresno in January.
But his draft board sent him a I-Y
deferment, lasting until
September 1967.
On January 12, 1967, at an
SDS noon rally in White Plaza
before 400 students, Harris
supported mass civil disobedience
of the draft laws. He called on
other students to refuse to be
drafted and to join him in jail.
Meanwhile the machinery of
the ASSU apparatus groun on.
When the ASSU Housing
Commission Report came out on
February 15, 1967, it was
dedicated to Dave Harris and to
Dr. Maurice Osborne, who then
headed the Cowell Health Center.
The "Wilbur experiment"
proposed in that report suggested
that in fall 1967 all the houses of
the Wilbur Hall dormitory
complex be integrated by sex and
by class. At that time, Wilbur
housed freshman class males.
The report dedication was
accompanied by the following
quotation from one-time UN
Secret ary - G e ner a 1 Dag
Hammarskjold, used by the
Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only

way of indicating opposition to
Harris's views on fraternities and
athletic scholarships.
During his administration
Harris clashed with LASSU over
his choice of student
appointments to the Committee
of 15, a top level negotiating
committee of students, faculty,
and administrators. He clashed
with the administration on such
issues as having a student-run
coffee house on campus and
allowing undergraduate women to
live off campus (Harris supported
a rent strike on the latter issue).
In early November 1966,
Harris clashed with the
administration over the naming of
students to serve on Presidential
committees. Harris termed the
committees "great miasmas of
psychic mud," but in what he
called an effort to make being a
student on a committee an
indication of constituency rather
than status. Harris nominated one
student for each opening instead
of following the time-honored
ground rules of "choose six get
three."
Harris told a noon rally in
White Plaza: "The key is not that
students serve on committees, but
that the mass thing called students
choose their own representa
tives ... .If we participate, we'll
go not as the guests of anybody,
but we'll go as representatives."
Harris later attacked the Study
of Education at Stanford, calling
it a "sophisticated whitewash"
with ''no democratic
participation" and wanted the
new ASSU Education Commission
to act as a parallel institution and
a watchdog to the study headed
by Vice-Provost Herbert Packer.
On October 12, 1966, at a
Quaker-sponsored forum on
conscientious objection, Harris
stated that he "did not accept the
mechanism of the draft at all." He
said that application for
conscientious objector status
implied that the draft board had
the right to make the decision.
Harris had sent his 11-S Student
classification back in July 1966.
On December 23, 1966, he was
classified I-A by his draft board.
He appealed for a I-O
conscientious objector
classification, while saying he was
not sure he would perform
alternate serivce. He commented,

"I am a conscientious objector,
but more of a conscientious
objector that the draft allows."
This application for CO status was
only a delaying tactic to allow
him to graduate before going to
jail. He took his physical
examination in Fresno in January.
But his draft board sent him a I-Y
deferment, lasting until
September 1967.
On January 12, 1967, at an
SDS noon rally in White Plaza
before 400 students, Harris
supported mass civil disobedience
of the draft laws. He called on
other students to refuse to be
drafted and to join him in jail.
Meanwhile the machinery of
the ASSU apparatus groun on.
When the ASSU Housing
Commission Report came out on
February 15, 1967, it was
dedicated to Dave Harris and to
Dr. Maurice Osborne, who then
headed the Cowell Health Center.
The "Wilbur experiment"
proposed in that report suggested
that in fall 1967 all the houses of
the Wilbur Hall dormitory
complex be integrated by sex and
by class. At that time, Wilbur
housed freshman class males.
The report dedication was
accompanied by the following
quotation from one-time UN
Secret ary - G e ner a 1 Dag
Hammarskjold, used by the
Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only
because he had the courage to go
ahead without asking whether
others were following or even
understood . . . ."
The next week, Harris resigned
as ASSU president, saying "I have
done all 1 am capable of doing for
the realization of education at
Stanford."

After Harris's resignation, one
of his aids, Tim Haight, wrote of
him in an opinion column in The
Daily: "He lacked the cynicism,
or sense of history, to be the
Machiavelli needed in the halls of
Space City Academe. He was not
a mediator-initiator. He was a
prophet. Perhaps the real failure
of his administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy."
Historian Staughton Lynd told
the Resistance national
conference in March 1969 that he
was "struck by the similarity
between David's reasons for
resigning his position as student
body president at Stanford and
(SNCC leader) Bob
(Moses-Parris)'s reasons for
fiercely refusing the charisma
thrust upon him. In each case, the
motivation is not guilt, but the
desire to enable others by
removing a personality, to oblige
others to improvise their own
militancy rather than deferring to
a leader."
In the spring of 1967 after his

resignation as ASSU president,
Harris joined with Dennis
Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.
In the course of two years,
Harris made 900 speeches for the
Resistance and traveled 100,000
miles. In one speech in 1967,
citing the Selective Service
System's pamphlet "Channeling"
as his authority, he told 400 Palo
Alto High School students: "The
primary purpose of military
conscription is not to induct
people into the military, but to
control the lives of the young
people of this country."
On Wednesday, October 18,
1967, Harris was arrested in front
of the Oakland Induction Center
on the third day of the Stop the
Draft Week demonstrations which
he had helped organize. He was
charged with trespassing,
disturbing the peace, and creating
a public nuisance. As a result of
this protest, he got to know
folksinger Joan Baez, to whom he

was married on March 26, 1968.
Harris refused induction into
the army on January 17, 1968, a
year and a half after first sending
in his draft card.
Of the subsequent trial which
resulted on May 29, 1968, in
Judge Oliver Carter sentencing
Harris to 3 years imprisonment,
Harris wrote: "What ought to be
decided in the process of justice is
the proper relationship of things,
the integration of a form. But the
trial held in the glory and polished
wood of the government's court,
began with a presumption. Justice
was being administered by the
state. Those who must execute
the decision of balance and
harmony that is justice felt an
allegiance not to justice, or the
lives justice must reconcile, but
the state. Justice became simply
the extension of an established
priority which made the decision
simply one of whether or not I,
and all that 1 stood representative
of, could ever be reconciled with
the state."
On April 28, 1966, David
Harris, a junior in Stanford's
social thought program, was
elected ASSU president after a
campaign which had focused
largely on educational issues.
Harris had come to Stanford
from Fresno High School,
politically a moderate Democrat,
in practice almost apolitical. This
same David Harris has now been
jailed for resisting the draft.
The story of Harris and his
politics is an important part of the
history of radicalism at Stanford.
Of his ASSU administration, Tom
Forstenzer, former speaker of
LASSU, said: "If there are
watersheds or turning points in
the life of an institution, Dave
Harris's administration (was) one
for this university." In addition,
the Resistance, a political group
which Harris helped found,
remains a vital part of the
American radical movement.
In the fall of 1964, Harris went
to Mississippi as a SNCC volunteer
to register blacks for the Freedom
vote. In the summer of 1965, he
picketed the White House
protesting the Viet-Nam war, and
in 1966 he was an active campus
supporter of the Delano farm
workers' strike.
In the spring of 1966, Harris
ran for ASSU president with Mike
Collins as his running mate. Their
platform stressed increased
student participation in the
decisions affecting students' lives.
Among the reforms proposed
were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only
requirement for a B.A. the
completion of 180 units of work,
prescriptions for contraceptives at
the health center, and creating
coffee houses, book shops, and

theatres around the campus.
Harris criticized Stanford's first
sit-in, which lasted 50 hours in
May 1966 in the office of Wallace
Sterling, then President, now
Chancellorof the University. It was
sparked by the administration's
decision to hold qualifying
examinations for the Selective
Service System on the Stanford
campus. Harris said at the time
that there hadn't been even an
attempt to use established
channels of communication. He
spent many hours in efforts to
mediate. This was well received by
those who sat in, but the lack of
response from the administration
led Harris to join others in
charging the administration with
"intransigence."
In June 1966, Harris, as ASSU
president-elect, called a meeting
of students, faculty, and
administrators at Asilomar in
Pacific Grove to discuss
educational reform at Stanford.
At this conference there was talk
on such subjects as extension of
the then new pass-fail grading
option to the entire freshman year
and to courses taken in fulfillment
of general studies and major
requirements and "desegregating"
the all-freshman residences.
Harris headed the Stanford
delegation to the National
Student Association congress in
Illinois that summer. There the
Liberal Caucus failed to pass a
resolution sponsored mainly by
Harris calling for immediate
American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam and characterizing the
war as an attempt to further "the
American empire . . .in a
calculated barbaric
fashion . . .against the will of the
indiginous population."
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone debate
on an anti-draft resolution
proposed by Harris. Harris and
others walked out to form a
Radical Caucus. They felt that the
nature of politics being practiced
in the Liberal Caucus destroyed

serious political discussion.
During pre-registration week in
September, Harris told 1300
incoming students gathered in
Memorial Auditorium for
freshman convocation: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
On October 20, Harris was
attacked by a band of students
wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said
afterwards that some members of
his house viewed the shaving of
Harris's head as a serious protest
aimed at changing the image of
Stanford of which Harris was the
public's symbol. Others were
"simply caught up in the
spontaneity of the thing." He said
that for some the hair-cut was a
way of indicating opposition to
Harris's views on fraternities and
athletic scholarships.
During his administration
Harris clashed with LASSU over

were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only
requirement for a B.A. the
completion of 180 units of work,
prescriptions for contraceptives at
the health center, and creating
coffee houses, book shops, and

theatres around the campus.
Harris criticized Stanford's first
sit-in, which lasted 50 hours in
May 1966 in the office of Wallace
Sterling, then President, now
Chancellorof the University. It was
sparked by the administration's
decision to hold qualifying
examinations for the Selective
Service System on the Stanford
campus. Harris said at the time
that there hadn't been even an
attempt to use established
channels of communication. He
spent many hours in efforts to
mediate. This was well received by
those who sat in, but the lack of
response from the administration
led Harris to join others in
charging the administration with
"intransigence."
In June 1966, Harris, as ASSU
president-elect, called a meeting
of students, faculty, and
administrators at Asilomar in
Pacific Grove to discuss
educational reform at Stanford.
At this conference there was talk
on such subjects as extension of
the then new pass-fail grading
option to the entire freshman year
and to courses taken in fulfillment
of general studies and major
requirements and "desegregating"
the all-freshman residences.
Harris headed the Stanford
delegation to the National
Student Association congress in
Illinois that summer. There the
Liberal Caucus failed to pass a
resolution sponsored mainly by
Harris calling for immediate
American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam and characterizing the
war as an attempt to further "the
American empire . . .in a
calculated barbaric
fashion . . .against the will of the
indiginous population."
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone debate
on an anti-draft resolution
proposed by Harris. Harris and
others walked out to form a
Radical Caucus. They felt that the
nature of politics being practiced
in the Liberal Caucus destroyed

serious political discussion.
During pre-registration week in
September, Harris told 1300
incoming students gathered in
Memorial Auditorium for
freshman convocation: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
On October 20, Harris was
attacked by a band of students
wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said
afterwards that some members of
his house viewed the shaving of
Harris's head as a serious protest
aimed at changing the image of
Stanford of which Harris was the
public's symbol. Others were
"simply caught up in the
spontaneity of the thing." He said
that for some the hair-cut was a
way of indicating opposition to
Harris's views on fraternities and
athletic scholarships.
During his administration
Harris clashed with LASSU over
his choice of student
appointments to the Committee
of 15, a top level negotiating
committee of students, faculty,
and administrators. He clashed
with the administration on such
issues as having a student-run
coffee house on campus and
allowing undergraduate women to
live off campus (Harris supported
a rent strike on the latter issue).
In early November 1966,
Harris clashed with the
administration over the naming of
students to serve on Presidential
committees. Harris termed the
committees "great miasmas of
psychic mud," but in what he
called an effort to make being a
student on a committee an
indication of constituency rather
than status. Harris nominated one
student for each opening instead
of following the time-honored
ground rules of "choose six get
three."
Harris told a noon rally in
White Plaza: "The key is not that
students serve on committees, but
that the mass thing called students
choose their own representa
tives ... .If we participate, we'll
go not as the guests of anybody,
but we'll go as representatives."
Harris later attacked the Study
of Education at Stanford, calling
it a "sophisticated whitewash"
with ''no democratic
participation" and wanted the
new ASSU Education Commission
to act as a parallel institution and
a watchdog to the study headed
by Vice-Provost Herbert Packer.
On October 12, 1966, at a
Quaker-sponsored forum on
conscientious objection, Harris
stated that he "did not accept the
mechanism of the draft at all." He
said that application for
conscientious objector status
implied that the draft board had
the right to make the decision.
Harris had sent his 11-S Student
classification back in July 1966.
On December 23, 1966, he was
classified I-A by his draft board.
He appealed for a I-O
conscientious objector
classification, while saying he was
not sure he would perform
alternate serivce. He commented,

"I am a conscientious objector,
but more of a conscientious
objector that the draft allows."
This application for CO status was
only a delaying tactic to allow
him to graduate before going to
jail. He took his physical
examination in Fresno in January.
But his draft board sent him a I-Y
deferment, lasting until
September 1967.
On January 12, 1967, at an
SDS noon rally in White Plaza
before 400 students, Harris
supported mass civil disobedience
of the draft laws. He called on
other students to refuse to be
drafted and to join him in jail.
Meanwhile the machinery of
the ASSU apparatus groun on.
When the ASSU Housing
Commission Report came out on
February 15, 1967, it was
dedicated to Dave Harris and to
Dr. Maurice Osborne, who then
headed the Cowell Health Center.
The "Wilbur experiment"
proposed in that report suggested
that in fall 1967 all the houses of
the Wilbur Hall dormitory
complex be integrated by sex and
by class. At that time, Wilbur
housed freshman class males.
The report dedication was
accompanied by the following
quotation from one-time UN
Secret ary - G e ner a 1 Dag
Hammarskjold, used by the
Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only
because he had the courage to go
ahead without asking whether
others were following or even
understood . . . ."
The next week, Harris resigned
as ASSU president, saying "I have
done all 1 am capable of doing for
the realization of education at
Stanford."

After Harris's resignation, one
of his aids, Tim Haight, wrote of
him in an opinion column in The
Daily: "He lacked the cynicism,
or sense of history, to be the
Machiavelli needed in the halls of
Space City Academe. He was not
a mediator-initiator. He was a
prophet. Perhaps the real failure
of his administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy."
Historian Staughton Lynd told
the Resistance national
conference in March 1969 that he
was "struck by the similarity
between David's reasons for
resigning his position as student
body president at Stanford and
(SNCC leader) Bob
(Moses-Parris)'s reasons for
fiercely refusing the charisma
thrust upon him. In each case, the
motivation is not guilt, but the
desire to enable others by
removing a personality, to oblige
others to improvise their own
militancy rather than deferring to
a leader."
In the spring of 1967 after his

resignation as ASSU president,
Harris joined with Dennis
Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.
In the course of two years,
Harris made 900 speeches for the
Resistance and traveled 100,000
miles. In one speech in 1967,
citing the Selective Service
System's pamphlet "Channeling"
as his authority, he told 400 Palo
Alto High School students: "The
primary purpose of military
conscription is not to induct
people into the military, but to
control the lives of the young
people of this country."
On Wednesday, October 18,
1967, Harris was arrested in front
of the Oakland Induction Center
on the third day of the Stop the
Draft Week demonstrations which
he had helped organize. He was
charged with trespassing,
disturbing the peace, and creating
a public nuisance. As a result of
this protest, he got to know
folksinger Joan Baez, to whom he

was married on March 26, 1968.
Harris refused induction into
the army on January 17, 1968, a
year and a half after first sending
in his draft card.
Of the subsequent trial which
resulted on May 29, 1968, in
Judge Oliver Carter sentencing
Harris to 3 years imprisonment,
Harris wrote: "What ought to be
decided in the process of justice is
the proper relationship of things,
the integration of a form. But the
trial held in the glory and polished
wood of the government's court,
began with a presumption. Justice
was being administered by the
state. Those who must execute
the decision of balance and
harmony that is justice felt an
allegiance not to justice, or the
lives justice must reconcile, but
the state. Justice became simply
the extension of an established
priority which made the decision
simply one of whether or not I,
and all that 1 stood representative
of, could ever be reconciled with
the state."
On April 28, 1966, David
Harris, a junior in Stanford's
social thought program, was
elected ASSU president after a
campaign which had focused
largely on educational issues.
Harris had come to Stanford
from Fresno High School,
politically a moderate Democrat,
in practice almost apolitical. This
same David Harris has now been
jailed for resisting the draft.
The story of Harris and his
politics is an important part of the
history of radicalism at Stanford.
Of his ASSU administration, Tom
Forstenzer, former speaker of
LASSU, said: "If there are
watersheds or turning points in
the life of an institution, Dave
Harris's administration (was) one
for this university." In addition,
the Resistance, a political group
which Harris helped found,
remains a vital part of the
American radical movement.
In the fall of 1964, Harris went
to Mississippi as a SNCC volunteer
to register blacks for the Freedom
vote. In the summer of 1965, he
picketed the White House
protesting the Viet-Nam war, and
in 1966 he was an active campus
supporter of the Delano farm
workers' strike.
In the spring of 1966, Harris
ran for ASSU president with Mike
Collins as his running mate. Their
platform stressed increased
student participation in the
decisions affecting students' lives.
Among the reforms proposed
were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only

Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.
In the course of two years,
Harris made 900 speeches for the
Resistance and traveled 100,000
miles. In one speech in 1967,
citing the Selective Service
System's pamphlet "Channeling"
as his authority, he told 400 Palo
Alto High School students: "The
primary purpose of military
conscription is not to induct
people into the military, but to
control the lives of the young
people of this country."
On Wednesday, October 18,
1967, Harris was arrested in front
of the Oakland Induction Center
on the third day of the Stop the
Draft Week demonstrations which
he had helped organize. He was
charged with trespassing,
disturbing the peace, and creating
a public nuisance. As a result of
this protest, he got to know
folksinger Joan Baez, to whom he

was married on March 26, 1968.
Harris refused induction into
the army on January 17, 1968, a
year and a half after first sending
in his draft card.
Of the subsequent trial which
resulted on May 29, 1968, in
Judge Oliver Carter sentencing
Harris to 3 years imprisonment,
Harris wrote: "What ought to be
decided in the process of justice is
the proper relationship of things,
the integration of a form. But the
trial held in the glory and polished
wood of the government's court,
began with a presumption. Justice
was being administered by the
state. Those who must execute
the decision of balance and
harmony that is justice felt an
allegiance not to justice, or the
lives justice must reconcile, but
the state. Justice became simply
the extension of an established
priority which made the decision
simply one of whether or not I,
and all that 1 stood representative
of, could ever be reconciled with
the state."
On April 28, 1966, David
Harris, a junior in Stanford's
social thought program, was
elected ASSU president after a
campaign which had focused
largely on educational issues.
Harris had come to Stanford
from Fresno High School,
politically a moderate Democrat,
in practice almost apolitical. This
same David Harris has now been
jailed for resisting the draft.
The story of Harris and his
politics is an important part of the
history of radicalism at Stanford.
Of his ASSU administration, Tom
Forstenzer, former speaker of
LASSU, said: "If there are
watersheds or turning points in
the life of an institution, Dave
Harris's administration (was) one
for this university." In addition,
the Resistance, a political group
which Harris helped found,
remains a vital part of the
American radical movement.
In the fall of 1964, Harris went
to Mississippi as a SNCC volunteer
to register blacks for the Freedom
vote. In the summer of 1965, he
picketed the White House
protesting the Viet-Nam war, and
in 1966 he was an active campus
supporter of the Delano farm
workers' strike.
In the spring of 1966, Harris
ran for ASSU president with Mike
Collins as his running mate. Their
platform stressed increased
student participation in the
decisions affecting students' lives.
Among the reforms proposed
were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only
requirement for a B.A. the
completion of 180 units of work,
prescriptions for contraceptives at
the health center, and creating
coffee houses, book shops, and

theatres around the campus.
Harris criticized Stanford's first
sit-in, which lasted 50 hours in
May 1966 in the office of Wallace
Sterling, then President, now
Chancellorof the University. It was
sparked by the administration's
decision to hold qualifying
examinations for the Selective
Service System on the Stanford
campus. Harris said at the time
that there hadn't been even an
attempt to use established
channels of communication. He
spent many hours in efforts to
mediate. This was well received by
those who sat in, but the lack of
response from the administration
led Harris to join others in
charging the administration with
"intransigence."
In June 1966, Harris, as ASSU
president-elect, called a meeting
of students, faculty, and
administrators at Asilomar in
Pacific Grove to discuss
educational reform at Stanford.
At this conference there was talk
on such subjects as extension of
the then new pass-fail grading
option to the entire freshman year
and to courses taken in fulfillment
of general studies and major
requirements and "desegregating"
the all-freshman residences.
Harris headed the Stanford
delegation to the National
Student Association congress in
Illinois that summer. There the
Liberal Caucus failed to pass a
resolution sponsored mainly by
Harris calling for immediate
American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam and characterizing the
war as an attempt to further "the
American empire . . .in a
calculated barbaric
fashion . . .against the will of the
indiginous population."
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone debate
on an anti-draft resolution
proposed by Harris. Harris and
others walked out to form a
Radical Caucus. They felt that the
nature of politics being practiced
in the Liberal Caucus destroyed

serious political discussion.
During pre-registration week in
September, Harris told 1300
incoming students gathered in
Memorial Auditorium for
freshman convocation: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
On October 20, Harris was
attacked by a band of students
wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said
afterwards that some members of
his house viewed the shaving of
Harris's head as a serious protest
aimed at changing the image of
Stanford of which Harris was the
public's symbol. Others were
"simply caught up in the
spontaneity of the thing." He said
that for some the hair-cut was a
way of indicating opposition to
Harris's views on fraternities and
athletic scholarships.
During his administration
Harris clashed with LASSU over
his choice of student
appointments to the Committee
of 15, a top level negotiating
committee of students, faculty,
and administrators. He clashed
with the administration on such
issues as having a student-run
coffee house on campus and
allowing undergraduate women to
live off campus (Harris supported
a rent strike on the latter issue).
In early November 1966,
Harris clashed with the
administration over the naming of
students to serve on Presidential
committees. Harris termed the
committees "great miasmas of
psychic mud," but in what he
called an effort to make being a
student on a committee an
indication of constituency rather
than status. Harris nominated one
student for each opening instead
of following the time-honored
ground rules of "choose six get
three."
Harris told a noon rally in
White Plaza: "The key is not that
students serve on committees, but
that the mass thing called students
choose their own representa
tives ... .If we participate, we'll
go not as the guests of anybody,
but we'll go as representatives."
Harris later attacked the Study
of Education at Stanford, calling
it a "sophisticated whitewash"
with ''no democratic
participation" and wanted the
new ASSU Education Commission
to act as a parallel institution and
a watchdog to the study headed
by Vice-Provost Herbert Packer.
On October 12, 1966, at a
Quaker-sponsored forum on
conscientious objection, Harris
stated that he "did not accept the
mechanism of the draft at all." He
said that application for
conscientious objector status
implied that the draft board had
the right to make the decision.
Harris had sent his 11-S Student
classification back in July 1966.
On December 23, 1966, he was
classified I-A by his draft board.
He appealed for a I-O
conscientious objector
classification, while saying he was
not sure he would perform
alternate serivce. He commented,

"I am a conscientious objector,
but more of a conscientious
objector that the draft allows."
This application for CO status was
only a delaying tactic to allow
him to graduate before going to
jail. He took his physical
examination in Fresno in January.
But his draft board sent him a I-Y
deferment, lasting until
September 1967.
On January 12, 1967, at an
SDS noon rally in White Plaza
before 400 students, Harris
supported mass civil disobedience
of the draft laws. He called on
other students to refuse to be
drafted and to join him in jail.
Meanwhile the machinery of
the ASSU apparatus groun on.
When the ASSU Housing
Commission Report came out on
February 15, 1967, it was
dedicated to Dave Harris and to
Dr. Maurice Osborne, who then
headed the Cowell Health Center.
The "Wilbur experiment"
proposed in that report suggested
that in fall 1967 all the houses of
the Wilbur Hall dormitory
complex be integrated by sex and
by class. At that time, Wilbur
housed freshman class males.
The report dedication was
accompanied by the following
quotation from one-time UN
Secret ary - G e ner a 1 Dag
Hammarskjold, used by the
Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only
because he had the courage to go
ahead without asking whether
others were following or even
understood . . . ."
The next week, Harris resigned
as ASSU president, saying "I have
done all 1 am capable of doing for
the realization of education at
Stanford."

After Harris's resignation, one
of his aids, Tim Haight, wrote of
him in an opinion column in The
Daily: "He lacked the cynicism,
or sense of history, to be the
Machiavelli needed in the halls of
Space City Academe. He was not
a mediator-initiator. He was a
prophet. Perhaps the real failure
of his administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy."
Historian Staughton Lynd told
the Resistance national
conference in March 1969 that he
was "struck by the similarity
between David's reasons for
resigning his position as student
body president at Stanford and
(SNCC leader) Bob
(Moses-Parris)'s reasons for
fiercely refusing the charisma
thrust upon him. In each case, the
motivation is not guilt, but the
desire to enable others by
removing a personality, to oblige
others to improvise their own
militancy rather than deferring to
a leader."
In the spring of 1967 after his

resignation as ASSU president,
Harris joined with Dennis
Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.

by Vice-Provost Herbert Packer.
On October 12, 1966, at a
Quaker-sponsored forum on
conscientious objection, Harris
stated that he "did not accept the
mechanism of the draft at all." He
said that application for
conscientious objector status
implied that the draft board had
the right to make the decision.
Harris had sent his 11-S Student
classification back in July 1966.
On December 23, 1966, he was
classified I-A by his draft board.
He appealed for a I-O
conscientious objector
classification, while saying he was
not sure he would perform
alternate serivce. He commented,

"I am a conscientious objector,
but more of a conscientious
objector that the draft allows."
This application for CO status was
only a delaying tactic to allow
him to graduate before going to
jail. He took his physical
examination in Fresno in January.
But his draft board sent him a I-Y
deferment, lasting until
September 1967.
On January 12, 1967, at an
SDS noon rally in White Plaza
before 400 students, Harris
supported mass civil disobedience
of the draft laws. He called on
other students to refuse to be
drafted and to join him in jail.
Meanwhile the machinery of
the ASSU apparatus groun on.
When the ASSU Housing
Commission Report came out on
February 15, 1967, it was
dedicated to Dave Harris and to
Dr. Maurice Osborne, who then
headed the Cowell Health Center.
The "Wilbur experiment"
proposed in that report suggested
that in fall 1967 all the houses of
the Wilbur Hall dormitory
complex be integrated by sex and
by class. At that time, Wilbur
housed freshman class males.
The report dedication was
accompanied by the following
quotation from one-time UN
Secret ary - G e ner a 1 Dag
Hammarskjold, used by the
Housing Commission to describe
Harris: "He broke fresh
ground—because, and only
because he had the courage to go
ahead without asking whether
others were following or even
understood . . . ."
The next week, Harris resigned
as ASSU president, saying "I have
done all 1 am capable of doing for
the realization of education at
Stanford."

After Harris's resignation, one
of his aids, Tim Haight, wrote of
him in an opinion column in The
Daily: "He lacked the cynicism,
or sense of history, to be the
Machiavelli needed in the halls of
Space City Academe. He was not
a mediator-initiator. He was a
prophet. Perhaps the real failure
of his administration lies upon the
shoulders of those who thought
they could translate him to the
bureaucracy."
Historian Staughton Lynd told
the Resistance national
conference in March 1969 that he
was "struck by the similarity
between David's reasons for
resigning his position as student
body president at Stanford and
(SNCC leader) Bob
(Moses-Parris)'s reasons for
fiercely refusing the charisma
thrust upon him. In each case, the
motivation is not guilt, but the
desire to enable others by
removing a personality, to oblige
others to improvise their own
militancy rather than deferring to
a leader."
In the spring of 1967 after his

resignation as ASSU president,
Harris joined with Dennis
Sweeney, Steve Hamilton, and
Lenny Heller in forming the
Resistance, with the intention of
promoting non-cooperation with
the draft.
In the course of two years,
Harris made 900 speeches for the
Resistance and traveled 100,000
miles. In one speech in 1967,
citing the Selective Service
System's pamphlet "Channeling"
as his authority, he told 400 Palo
Alto High School students: "The
primary purpose of military
conscription is not to induct
people into the military, but to
control the lives of the young
people of this country."
On Wednesday, October 18,
1967, Harris was arrested in front
of the Oakland Induction Center
on the third day of the Stop the
Draft Week demonstrations which
he had helped organize. He was
charged with trespassing,
disturbing the peace, and creating
a public nuisance. As a result of
this protest, he got to know
folksinger Joan Baez, to whom he

was married on March 26, 1968.
Harris refused induction into
the army on January 17, 1968, a
year and a half after first sending
in his draft card.
Of the subsequent trial which
resulted on May 29, 1968, in
Judge Oliver Carter sentencing
Harris to 3 years imprisonment,
Harris wrote: "What ought to be
decided in the process of justice is
the proper relationship of things,
the integration of a form. But the
trial held in the glory and polished
wood of the government's court,
began with a presumption. Justice
was being administered by the
state. Those who must execute
the decision of balance and
harmony that is justice felt an
allegiance not to justice, or the
lives justice must reconcile, but
the state. Justice became simply
the extension of an established
priority which made the decision
simply one of whether or not I,
and all that 1 stood representative
of, could ever be reconciled with
the state."
