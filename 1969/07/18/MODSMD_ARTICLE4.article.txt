## Dave Harris: Quiet Rebel 
### BILL EVERS 
On April 28, 1966, David
Harris, a junior in Stanford's
social thought program, was
elected ASSU president after a
campaign which had focused
largely on educational issues.
Harris had come to Stanford
from Fresno High School,
politically a moderate Democrat,
in practice almost apolitical. This
same David Harris has now been
jailed for resisting the draft.
The story of Harris and his
politics is an important part of the
history of radicalism at Stanford.
Of his ASSU administration, Tom
Forstenzer, former speaker of
LASSU, said: "If there are
watersheds or turning points in
the life of an institution, Dave
Harris's administration (was) one
for this university." In addition,
the Resistance, a political group
which Harris helped found,
remains a vital part of the
American radical movement.
In the fall of 1964, Harris went
to Mississippi as a SNCC volunteer
to register blacks for the Freedom
vote. In the summer of 1965, he
picketed the White House
protesting the Viet-Nam war, and
in 1966 he was an active campus
supporter of the Delano farm
workers' strike.
In the spring of 1966, Harris
ran for ASSU president with Mike
Collins as his running mate. Their
platform stressed increased
student participation in the
decisions affecting students' lives.
Among the reforms proposed
were a "one scholar, one vote"
democracy with a community
legislature and an elected Board of
Trustees, abolition of general
studies requirements, pass-fail
grading of all courses, an end to
fraternity rush substituting a
university-wide draw system,
possibly making the only
requirement for a B.A. the
completion of 180 units of work,
prescriptions for contraceptives at
the health center, and creating
coffee houses, book shops, and

theatres around the campus.
Harris criticized Stanford's first
sit-in, which lasted 50 hours in
May 1966 in the office of Wallace
Sterling, then President, now
Chancellorof the University. It was
sparked by the administration's
decision to hold qualifying
examinations for the Selective
Service System on the Stanford
campus. Harris said at the time
that there hadn't been even an
attempt to use established
channels of communication. He
spent many hours in efforts to
mediate. This was well received by
those who sat in, but the lack of
response from the administration
led Harris to join others in
charging the administration with
"intransigence."
In June 1966, Harris, as ASSU
president-elect, called a meeting
of students, faculty, and
administrators at Asilomar in
Pacific Grove to discuss
educational reform at Stanford.
At this conference there was talk
on such subjects as extension of
the then new pass-fail grading
option to the entire freshman year
and to courses taken in fulfillment
of general studies and major
requirements and "desegregating"
the all-freshman residences.
Harris headed the Stanford
delegation to the National
Student Association congress in
Illinois that summer. There the
Liberal Caucus failed to pass a
resolution sponsored mainly by
Harris calling for immediate
American withdrawal from
Viet-Nam and characterizing the
war as an attempt to further "the
American empire . . .in a
calculated barbaric
fashion . . .against the will of the
indiginous population."
Two nights later, the Liberal
Caucus voted to postpone debate
on an anti-draft resolution
proposed by Harris. Harris and
others walked out to form a
Radical Caucus. They felt that the
nature of politics being practiced
in the Liberal Caucus destroyed

serious political discussion.
During pre-registration week in
September, Harris told 1300
incoming students gathered in
Memorial Auditorium for
freshman convocation: "If any of
you believe in the word freedom,
and if any of you have come in
search of that high ideal, you're
not going to find yourselves free
until you find yourselves in the
position where you can stand up
to the University and tell it to
chuck itself into the lake. None of
you are really going to start being
educated until you're in the
position where you could just as
easily drop out of this university.
So much of the University is
inculcating dependence."
On October 20, Harris was
attacked by a band of students
wearing Halloween masks, who
shaved his head. Thirty-four
members and pledges of Delta Tau
Delta fraternity were placed on
probation for this incident. Delt
House president Bill Hogbom said
afterwards that some members of
