# Students Blast Businessmen
## The 						Complacent Generation 
### 
Chicano employment problems, middle-class
complacency and what businessmen can do to
institute social reforms were presented in a Stanford
Executive Program discussion at the Graduate
School of Business Wednesday by Barry Askinas,
one of the Associated Students Council of
Presidents, and Jesse Aguirre, a Stanford Chicano
student.
In a statement to the 120 American and foreign
businessmen attending, Askinas said: "Get your
organizations more involved in the community, in
social problems, and attempt to get the corporations
to do something about pollution."
Askinas also told them to expect and accept
more controls from the federal government: "I
basically think we have to look to the federal
government to set up various regulatory
mechanisms, and laws, which say, for instance, to
the corporation that you can't pollute that river
anymore; and you can't discriminate anymore."
Aguirre said to the businessmen, "We are
Americans . . .we are American as apple pie. In fact,
some of our peoples came here before the Anglos.
But we're Americans who have been neglected,
forgotten, shunned, ignored, and we'd like now to
find out what we're about."
Later Askinas added, "There are many things

wrong with my parent's generation. They've been
too complacent about a lot of things. They grew up
during the depression, sure, and just getting up out
of poverty was a tough job. But what's happened is
that a lot of middle-aged people have become fat
and complacent, and they have turned their backs
on a lot of problems a couple of miles down the
street.
"In a sense they've forgotten what it was like to
live under the conditions under which many of
them grew up and how, at the time, they would
have liked more help," he said.
Aguirre is an officer of MECHA, a Stanford
organization attempting to develop curriculum
relevant to the culture of the Chicano
(Spanish-American) community.
In answer to a question about what the
businessmen could do to help his people, Aguirre
answered: "First, businessmen must be aware that
as a group, Chicanos have suffered discrimination,
and that it is the responsibility of businessmen to
consider developing new criteria for judging
applicants of the Chicano community who seek
employment. Perhaps the standard operating
procedures which you use for your Anglos don't
apply to us, and perhaps a little positive
discrimination wouldn't hurt a thing."
