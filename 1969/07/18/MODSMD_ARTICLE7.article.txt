# College For Minority Students To Open Soon In E. Palo Alto
## 
### 
Nairobi College, a two-year
private institution designed by
and for blacks, Chicanos,
Orientals, and other persons of
color, will start operation on a
limited basis this fall, organizer
Robert Hoover announced
yesterday.
It is believed to be the only
private institution on the West

Coast devoted to and designed for
the educational needs of all
persons of color. Enrollment will
be open to whites.
Funded by initial private gifts
of $10,000, the college will seek
an additional $160,000 for
planning and development from
private and governmental sources
this year.
Approximately 100 Bay Area
educators have indicated interest
in teaching on a volunteer basis
during its initial year, and
applicants for enrollment have
been received from about 100
prospective students. Many of
both groups come from those
previously involved in the college
readiness program of the College
of San Mateo (CSM), which
Hoover directed during 1967-69.
Temporarily headquartered at
1627 Bay Road, East Palo Alto,
the college will offer its courses
initially in homes, churches, and
other facilities here, in San Mateo,
and in the S.F. Mission District.
The new college will extend a
three-year-old, community-based
educational program initiated by
residents of this San Mateo
County community of 30,000
whose population is about 80
percent black. Earlier programs,
which have attracted wide
recognition and growing
community support, include the
East Palo Alto Day School,
organized in 1966, and the
Summer Teen Project, now in
operation with more than 300
students.
A member of the East Palo
Alto Elementary School Board,

Hoover says regular educational
programs tend to leave persons of
color "unprepared for jobs,
college, life, or their roles in the
community in which they live."
Nairobi College will expect
students to work a minimum of
four hours a day in community
service organizations, such as
health centers, schools, welfare,
probation, legal aid, and
information centers. This will
strengthen both the service groups
and education, Hoover believes.
The college trustees will
include students, faculty, and
representatives of the
communities served by the
college. Papers to incorporate the
new institution on a non-profit
basis have been filed in
Sacramento. When approved, the
group will then seek tax-exempt
status from the Internal Revenue
Service.
The primary purpose of the
new institution will be to develop
leaders for Third World
communities, but applications
have been received and will be
accepted from white students as
well. These include several former
CSM tutors, whom Hoover
describes as "the most aware
white kids in the Bay Area."
