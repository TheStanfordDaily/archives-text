To The Editor:
A prominent American
recently said, "Men shield
themselves from truth".
After 100,000 American
deaths in Korea and Viet Nam
from combat, disease and wounds,
plus an expenditure of 100,000
millions of dollars, the majority of
Americans still feel they are
"containing communism".
Like incompetent gardeners,
we hack at the branches of the
problem and exhaust ourselves
making war on little Asiatics who
present no military threat
whatever to our country.
Meanwhile the root of the
challenge to our freedoms and
security, communist Russia, grows
apace and gleefully supplies the
weapons to kill our men.
While spending 30 billion a
year in Viet Nam, we quibble
about a few billion to protect
ourselves from the modern Soviet
missiles without and our
cancerous poverty within. A
nation that will not protect itself
or cure its social ills, is headed for
the scrapheap, as countless others
before it.
Are we bereft of our senses?
Are we mature enough to
admit our mistakes?
Are we fit to survive?
