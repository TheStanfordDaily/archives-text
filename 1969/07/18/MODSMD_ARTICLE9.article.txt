## God Save The Blues 
### DAVE STEVENS 
You've probably noticed small sections in our
local record stores devoted to English lp's, and if
you've never picked up on any of these, it might be
a good time to do some shopping. There seems to be
a lull in album releases right now—the record
companies are busy churning out retreads of groups
now departed: "Best of Cream," etc., not to forget
the new Hendrix "Smash Hits," with the previously
unavailable "Red House," the only straight blues
Hendrix has recorded.
There's several reasons for laying out the extra
bread for an English album, not the least of which if
you're a hi-fi nut is the uniformly superior sound
quality the British have succeeded in attaining. But
this consideration aside, you can find some real
treasures in the English sections. Curiously, many of
the most worthwhile records have nothing
whatsoever to do with the English pop scene, but
are simply re-issues of now-unavailable American
blues and rhythm and blues classics.
The white blues culture in England, as led by
blues "militants" like John Mayall, has as a rule
been much more concerned with the real stuff, the
roots, than has its American counterpart. That's
why shortly before his death Sonny Boy Williamson
told his friends that he was going back to live out
his days in England, where he was appreciated; and
disregarding Sonny Boy's reputation for
exaggeration, he was making a valid point: listen,
for example, to the audience reaction on the live
album he cut there with the post-Clapton Yardbirds.
It's a sad fact that many of the most influential and
enjoyable Chicago blues stylists have recordings
presently available only in the high-priced English
format. My own favorite Chicago bluesman, for
example, the late influential bottleneck guitarist and
singer Elmore James, has had no Ameican records in
print for several years, save occasional appearances
on blues anthologies. A good introduction to his
work is "Elmore James' Greatest Hits" on the
British Sue label, which features such classic
performances as "Shake Your Moneymaker," which
you've heard on the first Butterfield album, "Dust
My Blues" which you've probably heard by John
Mayall, and James' reworking of the Robert
Johnson standard "Crossroads," which was
reworked again by Eric Clapton on the Cream
"Wheels of Fire" live set. The most persistent
current imitator of James is Peter Green, late of
Mayall's band and now with Fleetwood Mac; and
it's a testament to James' abilities that it's much
harder to tire of Elmore James using the same basic
approach to every number than to get bored by
Peter Green.
There's more, too, such as the classic r & b
material: re-issues of Huey "Piano" Smith and the
Clowns (whose biggest record was "Don't You just
Know It" back in 1957), Inez and Charlie Fox
(Mockingbird" in the early '60's), and the classic
collaboration of Ike and Tina Turner with Phil

Spector (who produced those incredible Righteous
Brothers and Ronnettes records the fifty-piece
orchestras and stoned tabernacle choir back-ups
sounding like Technology Unchained), "River Deep
Mountain High."
There's interesting stuff besides in the field of
English blues, both musically and historically. You
can hear early Eric Clapton in "Five Live
Yardbirds"—Eric "Slowhand" Clapton, according to
the jacket blurb, or listen to "The Sound of '65" by
the Graham Bond Organization, which features Jack
Bruce and Ginger Baker of Cream fame on bass and
drums. Bond, who passed through Stanford last
summer and created something of an instant legend
up at Beta Chi, is an original and interesting
singer-organist. Where else would you hear a
jazz-based rock group doing a song like "Tammy"?
And probably the best Savoy Brown album is the
first, never released here, which has different
personnel than the American albums, and more of
an exciting jamming feeling to the music.
I've been a fan of the English blues approach
since those frantic early days of the Rolling Stones,
the days of the deliciously dirty "King Bee," the
gutsy and primitive Stones who brought Howlin'
Wolf on the Hullabaloo TV show to do "Little Red
Rooster," their single at the time. It seems to me
that somehow, with all the changes in style, the
English have been more successful than white
Americans in keeping their own stamp on the blues;
and with the advent of the super-guitarists like
Clapton, they have forged something of an original
approach, defined by exuberance, volume, and a
latent psychedelicism. For me, the best example of
that style is the English trio Love Sculpture, who
have taken the high-flying Clapton type of blues to
some of its furthest and most satisfying limits. While
they're not particularly funky like the early Stones,
they do some of the most exciting rave-ups I've
heard yet. Lead guitarist Dave Edmunds has learned
his Clapton book cold: his version of Freddie King's
"Stumble" is reminiscent of Clapton's recording of
that other King instrumental, "Hideaway," and
every bit as good, especially when you're blasting
your headphones to bits at volume ten. They're all
good singers, with beautifully clear voices that lend
themselves especially well to the successful remakes
of two BB King tunes. Only in places, such as the
versions of "On the Road Again" and"I Believe to
My Soul," the early Ray Charles blues, is their
choice of material inappropriate to their
abilities—and they come close to carrying it off here
too. The best cut on the album, though, has to be
the eerie, lovely "Summertime, tastefully
psychedelicized with a moderate echo on the vocal,
and which features a mind-blowing note-for-note
scatting vocal perfectly synchronized with
Edmunds' soaring guitar solo. The label says "File
under Jazz: Blues," but don't let it fool you for a
minute. It's quite simply perfectly pure English
blues.

Spector (who produced those incredible Righteous
Brothers and Ronnettes records the fifty-piece
orchestras and stoned tabernacle choir back-ups
sounding like Technology Unchained), "River Deep
Mountain High."
There's interesting stuff besides in the field of
English blues, both musically and historically. You
can hear early Eric Clapton in "Five Live
Yardbirds"—Eric "Slowhand" Clapton, according to
the jacket blurb, or listen to "The Sound of '65" by
the Graham Bond Organization, which features Jack
Bruce and Ginger Baker of Cream fame on bass and
drums. Bond, who passed through Stanford last
summer and created something of an instant legend
up at Beta Chi, is an original and interesting
singer-organist. Where else would you hear a
jazz-based rock group doing a song like "Tammy"?
And probably the best Savoy Brown album is the
first, never released here, which has different
personnel than the American albums, and more of
an exciting jamming feeling to the music.
I've been a fan of the English blues approach
since those frantic early days of the Rolling Stones,
the days of the deliciously dirty "King Bee," the
gutsy and primitive Stones who brought Howlin'
Wolf on the Hullabaloo TV show to do "Little Red
Rooster," their single at the time. It seems to me
that somehow, with all the changes in style, the
English have been more successful than white
Americans in keeping their own stamp on the blues;
and with the advent of the super-guitarists like
Clapton, they have forged something of an original
approach, defined by exuberance, volume, and a
latent psychedelicism. For me, the best example of
that style is the English trio Love Sculpture, who
have taken the high-flying Clapton type of blues to
some of its furthest and most satisfying limits. While
they're not particularly funky like the early Stones,
they do some of the most exciting rave-ups I've
heard yet. Lead guitarist Dave Edmunds has learned
his Clapton book cold: his version of Freddie King's
"Stumble" is reminiscent of Clapton's recording of
that other King instrumental, "Hideaway," and
every bit as good, especially when you're blasting
your headphones to bits at volume ten. They're all
good singers, with beautifully clear voices that lend
themselves especially well to the successful remakes
of two BB King tunes. Only in places, such as the
versions of "On the Road Again" and"I Believe to
My Soul," the early Ray Charles blues, is their
choice of material inappropriate to their
abilities—and they come close to carrying it off here
too. The best cut on the album, though, has to be
the eerie, lovely "Summertime, tastefully
psychedelicized with a moderate echo on the vocal,
and which features a mind-blowing note-for-note
scatting vocal perfectly synchronized with
Edmunds' soaring guitar solo. The label says "File
under Jazz: Blues," but don't let it fool you for a
minute. It's quite simply perfectly pure English
blues.
You've probably noticed small sections in our
local record stores devoted to English lp's, and if
you've never picked up on any of these, it might be
a good time to do some shopping. There seems to be
a lull in album releases right now—the record
companies are busy churning out retreads of groups
now departed: "Best of Cream," etc., not to forget
the new Hendrix "Smash Hits," with the previously
unavailable "Red House," the only straight blues
Hendrix has recorded.
There's several reasons for laying out the extra
bread for an English album, not the least of which if
you're a hi-fi nut is the uniformly superior sound
quality the British have succeeded in attaining. But
this consideration aside, you can find some real
treasures in the English sections. Curiously, many of
the most worthwhile records have nothing
whatsoever to do with the English pop scene, but
are simply re-issues of now-unavailable American
blues and rhythm and blues classics.
The white blues culture in England, as led by
blues "militants" like John Mayall, has as a rule
been much more concerned with the real stuff, the
roots, than has its American counterpart. That's
why shortly before his death Sonny Boy Williamson
told his friends that he was going back to live out
his days in England, where he was appreciated; and
disregarding Sonny Boy's reputation for
exaggeration, he was making a valid point: listen,
for example, to the audience reaction on the live
album he cut there with the post-Clapton Yardbirds.
It's a sad fact that many of the most influential and
enjoyable Chicago blues stylists have recordings
presently available only in the high-priced English
format. My own favorite Chicago bluesman, for
example, the late influential bottleneck guitarist and
singer Elmore James, has had no Ameican records in
print for several years, save occasional appearances
on blues anthologies. A good introduction to his
work is "Elmore James' Greatest Hits" on the
British Sue label, which features such classic
performances as "Shake Your Moneymaker," which
you've heard on the first Butterfield album, "Dust
My Blues" which you've probably heard by John
Mayall, and James' reworking of the Robert
Johnson standard "Crossroads," which was
reworked again by Eric Clapton on the Cream
"Wheels of Fire" live set. The most persistent
current imitator of James is Peter Green, late of
Mayall's band and now with Fleetwood Mac; and
it's a testament to James' abilities that it's much
harder to tire of Elmore James using the same basic
approach to every number than to get bored by
Peter Green.
There's more, too, such as the classic r & b
material: re-issues of Huey "Piano" Smith and the
Clowns (whose biggest record was "Don't You just
Know It" back in 1957), Inez and Charlie Fox
(Mockingbird" in the early '60's), and the classic
collaboration of Ike and Tina Turner with Phil

Spector (who produced those incredible Righteous

You've probably noticed small sections in our
local record stores devoted to English lp's, and if
you've never picked up on any of these, it might be
a good time to do some shopping. There seems to be
a lull in album releases right now—the record
companies are busy churning out retreads of groups
now departed: "Best of Cream," etc., not to forget
the new Hendrix "Smash Hits," with the previously
unavailable "Red House," the only straight blues
Hendrix has recorded.
There's several reasons for laying out the extra
bread for an English album, not the least of which if
you're a hi-fi nut is the uniformly superior sound
quality the British have succeeded in attaining. But
this consideration aside, you can find some real
treasures in the English sections. Curiously, many of
the most worthwhile records have nothing
whatsoever to do with the English pop scene, but
are simply re-issues of now-unavailable American
blues and rhythm and blues classics.
The white blues culture in England, as led by
blues "militants" like John Mayall, has as a rule
been much more concerned with the real stuff, the
roots, than has its American counterpart. That's
why shortly before his death Sonny Boy Williamson
told his friends that he was going back to live out
his days in England, where he was appreciated; and
disregarding Sonny Boy's reputation for
exaggeration, he was making a valid point: listen,
for example, to the audience reaction on the live
album he cut there with the post-Clapton Yardbirds.
It's a sad fact that many of the most influential and
enjoyable Chicago blues stylists have recordings
presently available only in the high-priced English
format. My own favorite Chicago bluesman, for
example, the late influential bottleneck guitarist and
singer Elmore James, has had no Ameican records in
print for several years, save occasional appearances
on blues anthologies. A good introduction to his
work is "Elmore James' Greatest Hits" on the
British Sue label, which features such classic
performances as "Shake Your Moneymaker," which
you've heard on the first Butterfield album, "Dust
My Blues" which you've probably heard by John
Mayall, and James' reworking of the Robert
Johnson standard "Crossroads," which was
reworked again by Eric Clapton on the Cream
"Wheels of Fire" live set. The most persistent
current imitator of James is Peter Green, late of
Mayall's band and now with Fleetwood Mac; and
it's a testament to James' abilities that it's much
harder to tire of Elmore James using the same basic
approach to every number than to get bored by
Peter Green.
There's more, too, such as the classic r & b
material: re-issues of Huey "Piano" Smith and the
Clowns (whose biggest record was "Don't You just
Know It" back in 1957), Inez and Charlie Fox
(Mockingbird" in the early '60's), and the classic
collaboration of Ike and Tina Turner with Phil

Spector (who produced those incredible Righteous
Brothers and Ronnettes records the fifty-piece
orchestras and stoned tabernacle choir back-ups
sounding like Technology Unchained), "River Deep
Mountain High."
There's interesting stuff besides in the field of
English blues, both musically and historically. You
can hear early Eric Clapton in "Five Live
Yardbirds"—Eric "Slowhand" Clapton, according to
the jacket blurb, or listen to "The Sound of '65" by
the Graham Bond Organization, which features Jack
Bruce and Ginger Baker of Cream fame on bass and
drums. Bond, who passed through Stanford last
summer and created something of an instant legend
up at Beta Chi, is an original and interesting
singer-organist. Where else would you hear a
jazz-based rock group doing a song like "Tammy"?
And probably the best Savoy Brown album is the
first, never released here, which has different
personnel than the American albums, and more of
an exciting jamming feeling to the music.
I've been a fan of the English blues approach
since those frantic early days of the Rolling Stones,
the days of the deliciously dirty "King Bee," the
gutsy and primitive Stones who brought Howlin'
Wolf on the Hullabaloo TV show to do "Little Red
Rooster," their single at the time. It seems to me
that somehow, with all the changes in style, the
English have been more successful than white
Americans in keeping their own stamp on the blues;
and with the advent of the super-guitarists like
Clapton, they have forged something of an original
approach, defined by exuberance, volume, and a
latent psychedelicism. For me, the best example of
that style is the English trio Love Sculpture, who
have taken the high-flying Clapton type of blues to
some of its furthest and most satisfying limits. While
they're not particularly funky like the early Stones,
they do some of the most exciting rave-ups I've
heard yet. Lead guitarist Dave Edmunds has learned
his Clapton book cold: his version of Freddie King's
"Stumble" is reminiscent of Clapton's recording of
that other King instrumental, "Hideaway," and
every bit as good, especially when you're blasting
your headphones to bits at volume ten. They're all
good singers, with beautifully clear voices that lend
themselves especially well to the successful remakes
of two BB King tunes. Only in places, such as the
versions of "On the Road Again" and"I Believe to
My Soul," the early Ray Charles blues, is their
choice of material inappropriate to their
abilities—and they come close to carrying it off here
too. The best cut on the album, though, has to be
the eerie, lovely "Summertime, tastefully
psychedelicized with a moderate echo on the vocal,
and which features a mind-blowing note-for-note
scatting vocal perfectly synchronized with
Edmunds' soaring guitar solo. The label says "File
under Jazz: Blues," but don't let it fool you for a
minute. It's quite simply perfectly pure English
blues.
