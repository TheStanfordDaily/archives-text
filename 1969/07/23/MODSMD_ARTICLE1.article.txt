# Rock Concert Blocked Again By University
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Yesterday the Policy
Subcommittee of the Committee
on Public Exercises met with
representatives from SCORE, the
on-campus affiliate of the
Midpeninsula Free University, and
reportedly decided afterwards to
recommend that President
Kenneth Pitzer deny the Free U
permission to hold a concert
August 17 in Frost Ampitheater.
The Policy Subcommittee took
testimony from Tim Cobum and
Bob Cullenbine of the Free U,
whom they asked about
provisions at the concert for
ticket-taking, cleaning up, and
crowd control.
In the course of the meeting,
subcommittee member Jim
Schnieder of Stanford's Coalition
for an Academic Community
questioned the Free U
representatives about their
affiliations with the April 3
Movement.
Schneider told The Daily last
night that he personally was upset
that the subcommittee's
recommendation was not made
clearly on political grounds.
The subcommittee submitted
to Pitzer*s office a
recommendation suggesting that
Stanford not host the concert
because, in the subcommittee's
opinion, the University would not
have enough control over it.
Action on the recommendation
by the President's office is
expected today.
At present the Committee of
Public Exercises is handling
.equests to use University
facilities which are under the
Committee's jurisdiction on an
individual basis. Reportedly a new
forty-page manual is now
circulating in draft form. It is said
to describe specifically the
requirements "be-ins" must fulfill.
