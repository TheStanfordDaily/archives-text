To The Editor:
On reading a letter to the Stanford Daily, July 18:
. . Meanwhile the root of the challenge to our freedoms and
security . . . grows apace and gleefully supplies the weapons to
kill our men . . . We quibble about a few billion to protect our
selves from the modern Soviet missiles without and cancerous
poverty within. A nation that will not protect itself or curve its
social ills is headed for the scrapheap, as countless others before
it . . . Are we fit to survive?"
Protect OURselves?
Build walls to keep THEM out?
So that THEY, having less
will not take what WE possess?
Devise missiles, instant death,
fire-aimed to insure an exclamation point of doom
or expected challenge by THOSE,
having little to lose, who cry for room.
To punisn, to "teach a lesson"
so that THEY will respect: LAW and ORDER
National SovereigntyTheCapitalisticSystemFree
Enterprise
LAW which protects privilege
ORDER for comfortable continuity
So that WE, in privacy, can know
that WE have a RIGHT to carpeted palaces,
soft music, fast cars,
cuisine of kings,
suntanned liesure ....
which can only be OURS
by excluding
THEM.
Why speak of rights? OUR sickness is that WE have not yet
realized that WE are THEY.
WE are trying to protect ourselves from ourselves.
Fatal illusion!
