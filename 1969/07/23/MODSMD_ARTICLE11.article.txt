# Man & State
## Clever Lunacy 
### Bill Evers 
Well, the right-before-your-eyes Marshall McLuhan version of the
politics of the budgetary process has finally happened. NASA hit the
moon with men.
It began in April 1961, when President John Kennedy was anxious
to improve national prestige after the flight of Soviet cosmonaut Yuri
Gargarin on April 12 and the Cuban government's defeat on April 17 of
the US-supported Bay of Pigs invasion. Kennedy sent a memorandum
to Vice President Lyndon Johnson on April 20.
Question number one read: "Do we have a chance of beating the
Soviets by putting a laboratory in space, or by a trip around the moon,
or by a rocket to land on the moon, or by a rocket to go to the moon
and back with a man?"
In the next two weeks Johnson carried out his assignment.
According to the New York Times: "On April 24, Mr. Johnson heard
representaties of the military services and Dr. (Wernher) von Braun
discuss their views on the space program. Sitting with Mr. Johnson at
this meeting were three close friends: George Brown, of the Houston
construction company of Brown & Root; Frank Stanton, president of
the Columbia Broadcasting System; and Donald Cook, of the American
Electric Power Corporation." In late May, Kennedy told a joint session
of Congress that the US would land men on the moon during the
1960'5.
The space program is not just a modern equivalent of the Roman
Empire's public circuses. It is also typical of the operation of state
monopoly capitalism. The flight to the moon was a spectacular
produced through the cooperation of the State and its favored
corporations.
The local Palo Alto concerns who were rewarded with moon
program contracts after successfully using the levers of power were
Hewlett-Packard, Varian Associates, and Philco-Ford.
What is interesting about many contractors like these is that firms
who perform highly technical work are suffering because of the
Viet-Nam war. The threat of war against an enemy who has a missile
system supplies them with work. But the actual production of war
equipment is not their field. Putting a man on the moon, however, is a
job designed to utilize their skills.
The American political economy has been so constructed that at
present it is not just the appropriate industries who desire a space
program. So do professors and unions.
What do the corporate liberals and conservative social-democrats
think of the space program? In a recent essay, Michael Harrington,
offering a design for the American economy in time of peace, finds it
sad that "there is a certain puritanism on the Left whenever the
question of space comes up. It is the fashion to denigrate spending
money on heaven when earth is still so shoddy." Harrington argues that
the particular sector of the economy (research & development people,
etc.) who benefit from the war economy have to be taken care of. He
supports contracts for the space industry because its work is
"technologically similar" to the war industry.
Harrington cities John Kenneth Galbraith's New Industrial State in
which Galbraith contends that after disarmament the size of the public
sector must be maintained through space program money. This is
because Galbraith believes that a reduction in taxes, resulting in
increased consumer spending would destabilize the economy.
In addition, Galbraith asserts that war spending underwrites
technological advances. He says that the industrial system will not
easily give up the advantages of the "nearly riskless weapons economy."
So he suggests the space program as a substitute. The political economy
of war is recognized by these men as being strikingly similar to the
political economy of space.
As for the future, the Air Force's Manned Orbiting Laboratory has
been shelved. Will space contractors now go into producing the ABM or
the multiple independently-targeted reentry vehicle (MIRV)?
Will the recommendation of Vice President Spiro Agnew's Space
Council that the US put men on Mars in the early 1980's prove to be
the next bonanza for the electronics firms?
It cost $24 billion to put men on the moon. Now that we live in the
space age, the political plums are just that much bigger.
