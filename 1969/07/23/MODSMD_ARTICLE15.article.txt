• Beware The Pill
Birth control pills seem to do
more than just prevent
pregnancies.
According to a Stanford
University pathologist,
contraceptive pills give the blood
a greenish tint. As a result, a
doctor can get false readings
which might point to a disease a
patient or a blood donor does not
have.
Green plasma in a unit of
donated blood usually indicates a
bacterial infection of the blood
and cannot be used in patients
who need transfusions.
But now "green plasma should
no longer suggest solely the
presence of a pseudomonas
organism producing a green
pigment," writes Dr. Paul L. Wolf
in the current issue of the New
England Journal of Medicine.
• New Jet Plan
Plans for a 66-passenger jet
airplane which could operate from
runways the size of parking lots
and which could fall from a height
of 200 feet without serious injury
to passengers were described at a
conference at Stanford Graduate
School of Business Friday.
The passenger jet was one of
two unusual aircraft discussed in a
paper on air vehicle studies by
Bryan Noton, Stanford visiting
professor of aeronautics and
astronautics, at a Business
School-sponsored symposium.
Noton also told about a jet air
freighter twice the size and double
the capacity of today's largest
airplanes. Plans were developed by
a team of graduate students as
part of a course project in
Stanford's Department of
Aeronautics and Astronautics
Engineering.
Noton called the projects
practical and feasible from a
design and engineering standpoint,
although he said, "further
iterations of the design process
would be necessary to fully refine
the system."
The passenger jet, called the
ESTOL (Extremely Short
Take-Off and Landing), would be
developed for travel between
California cities beginning in
1980.
• Johns Gets Post
Dean Richard H. Jahns of the
Stanford School of Earth Sciences
has been named secretary of the
five-university Pacific Region of
the Universities Space Research
Association (USRA), a national
consortium of 48 universities
formed to aid in the advancement
of space research.
The consortium plans to build
and operate laboratories for
education and research in space

science and technology. It also has
made a proposal to manage
NASA's Lunar Science Institute in
Houston where materials from the
moon will be brought >. for
scientific study.
A Council of Institutions
composed of representatives of
the 48 member universities will
oversee USRA. Guidelines for the
organization were worked out by
the Universities Organizing
Committee for Space Sciences of
the National Academy of
Sciences.
