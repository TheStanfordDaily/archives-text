# At Summer Festival
## 'Our Town' To Be Presented 
### 
A mixed media presentation of
Thornton Wilder's American
classic, "Our Town," will be given
by the Stanford Speech and
Drama Department as an
additional attraction to the
Stanford Summer Festival.
The play will be seen at 8 p.m.
July 30-Aug. 2 at the Nitery,
located in the Old Union.
"We chose this play because it
embodies all the establishment
values that Americans hold dear,"
said Christopher Hampton, the
director and a visiting professor
from San Francisco State. "You
don't recognize this readily
because of the play's nostalgia and
its dry New England form," he
added.
"Nevertheless the play deals
with major current problems: the
generation gap, the problem of
non-involvement (no one helps
Simon Stimpson the town drunk),
and sexual repression."
An example of the "hush
hush" attitude toward sex is
obvious in one of Mrs. Webb's
speeches. She says, "It's a shame
to send a girl into marriage. I went
into it blind as a bat. I only hope
her girlfriends have told her
something about it."
The script points out the
problems of the repressed society
it depicts. When Emily returns to

earth to celebrate her 12th
birthday, she chooses to stay dead
rather than live in the closed
environment that she knew before
her death in childbirth.
The play is staged to show a
double alienation. The 26 actors
are on stage all the time. The stage
manager forces them to assume
parts which in turn make them
espouse the values of
establishment America. Those
who are not playing character
roles remain on stage in a chorus.
"The Chorus expresses present
day life. The actors resent being
pulled into the play by the stage
manager."
The mixed media part of the
presentation comes in the form of

a film clip showing the American
way of sex. George Gibbs, Emily's
husband, is initiated into the
Playboy stud philosophy: "The
opposite sex is to be
manipulated." Beside the film clip
there will be 35 mm slides, a light
show using black light, and a fog
machine.
The play represents the
culmination of the Farout Theater
Workshop. Dr. Wendell Cole has
been teaching dramatic literature
of the Far Out Theater. Douglas
Russell, also of the Stanford
Drama Department, has been
teaching costume styles, and
Derek Hunt has been explaining
theater techniques.

additional attraction to the
Stanford Summer Festival.
The play will be seen at 8 p.m.
July 30-Aug. 2 at the Nitery,
located in the Old Union.
"We chose this play because it
embodies all the establishment
values that Americans hold dear,"
said Christopher Hampton, the
director and a visiting professor
from San Francisco State. "You
don't recognize this readily
because of the play's nostalgia and
its dry New England form," he
added.
"Nevertheless the play deals
with major current problems: the
generation gap, the problem of
non-involvement (no one helps
Simon Stimpson the town drunk),
and sexual repression."
An example of the "hush
hush" attitude toward sex is
obvious in one of Mrs. Webb's
speeches. She says, "It's a shame
to send a girl into marriage. I went
into it blind as a bat. I only hope
her girlfriends have told her
something about it."
The script points out the
problems of the repressed society
it depicts. When Emily returns to

earth to celebrate her 12th
birthday, she chooses to stay dead
rather than live in the closed
environment that she knew before
her death in childbirth.
The play is staged to show a
double alienation. The 26 actors
are on stage all the time. The stage
manager forces them to assume
parts which in turn make them
espouse the values of
establishment America. Those
who are not playing character
roles remain on stage in a chorus.
"The Chorus expresses present
day life. The actors resent being
pulled into the play by the stage
manager."
The mixed media part of the
presentation comes in the form of

a film clip showing the American
way of sex. George Gibbs, Emily's
husband, is initiated into the
Playboy stud philosophy: "The
opposite sex is to be
manipulated." Beside the film clip
there will be 35 mm slides, a light
show using black light, and a fog
machine.
The play represents the
culmination of the Farout Theater
Workshop. Dr. Wendell Cole has
been teaching dramatic literature
of the Far Out Theater. Douglas
Russell, also of the Stanford
Drama Department, has been
teaching costume styles, and
Derek Hunt has been explaining
theater techniques.
