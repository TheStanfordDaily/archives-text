# Summer Festival Adds Extra Shows
## 
### 
Extra performances have been added for two of the attractions at
the Stanford Summer Festival, classical guitarist Oscar Ghiglia and the
off-Broadway play "Jacques Brel is Alive and Well and Living in Paris."
Ghiglia, who opened last night, was originally scheduled to give only
two concerts, July 22 and July 26, both at 8 p.m. in Dinkelspiel
Auditorium. But since the two are sold out, a third performance has
been added—for tomorrow night, July 24, same time and place as the
others.
"Jacques Brel" is being held over in Memorial Auditorium for
another week. After opening to nearly unanimous rave reviews from
Bay Area critics July 15, the musical, starring Elly Stone and Robert
Guillaume, was scheduled to close last Sunday night. But eight
additional performances have been set, starting last night and running
through next Sunday evening, July 27. Matinees are also planned for
Saturday and Sunday afternoons.
All evening performances are at 8 p.m., with afternoon shows at
2:30. Tickets are available at Mem Aud and Dink on campus.
The repertory for Ghiglia's show tomorrow night will be the same as
that at his opening. Included are "Fantasia," by Luis Milan; "La
Freschbalda," by Girolamo Frescobaldi; "Preludio, fuge e allegro," by
J.S. Bach; "Tiento Antigo," by Maurice Ohana; "Satabande," by
Francis Poulenc; "Segovia," by Albert Roussel; "Tarantella," by
Tedesco; "Sevillana" by Turina; "Etude No. 11," by Villa-Lobos;
"Mallorca," by Albeniz; and "La Maja de Goya," by Granados.
Born in Livorno, Italy, Ghiglia comes from an artistic family—his
father paints, his mother is a pianist. The bearded guitarist, who more
closely resembles a campus radical than a classical musician, studied and
was an assistant to Andres Segovia. He has since been hailed as the
"heir" to the Spanish master. He has won several major international
competitions.
