# United Front Against Fascism
## Panther Conference 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
For the first time in modern
American history, the radical
black liberation movement has
joined forces with white radicals
in an alliance against racism,
imperialism and capitalism.
The alliance was made at the
first conference of the new
"United Front Against Fascism,"
in Oakland last weekend,
organized and led by the Black
Panther Party.
About 4,000 delegates, most of
them white, came from all over
the nation to hear three days of
fiery revolutionary rhetoric and a
plan for immediate action.
Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale announced that control of
police would be the Front's first
project. Fifty to one hundred
local "Committees to Combat

Fascism" are expected to begin
campaigns to bring police under
local community control.
Seale told the delegates about a
program underway in Oakland
and Berkeley to break up the
police departments into several
smaller units, each with an elected
governing council. The Panthers
and Peace & Freedom Party are
circulating petitions to put their
amendments to the city charters
on the next ballot. Similar action
was urged for all cities in the
nation.
The petition campaign is only a
moderate first step for the Front.
The Panthers implied that the
campaign would be partly an
educational and organizing tool
against the upsurge of fascist
repression of dissident groups. "If
you get people working, you have
raised them to a higher level of
struggle," said Seale at the
concluding session Sunday.
The Panther's angry words set
the tone for the conference.
"They say we have government
of the people, by the people, for
the people," shouted Seale at the
opening session Friday. "Ha! We
really have government of the
fascists, by the fascists, for the
fascists."
Seale described the terror
campaign waged by the FBI and
other police which has caused the
deaths of 19 Panthers in the past
year. Mass arrests on trumped-up
charges and vandalistic attacks on
Panther offices have been
common.
"We are not calling this United
Front just to save the Black
Panthers," Seale told the
delegates. Concentration camps
for dissidents of all races may be
near, he warned.
Speaker after speaker
emphasized the need for urgent,
unified resistance by
revolutionaries. "We have to
understand and move quickly
with a practical program," said
Seale. "We have no time for a lot
of ideological in-fighting and
bullcrap."
The Panthers showed their own

tolerance of widely differing
political positions by inviting
speakers who ranged from liberals
like Carleton Goodlet to old-line
Communists like Herbert
Aptheker to Maoist
revolutionaries like SDS. The only
group which was excluded from
the program, and later expelled
from some of'the meetings, was
the Progressive Labor Party,
which has condemned the
Panthers as racist and nationalist
on narrow ideological grounds.
The Panther's own politics are
close to SDS. Seale said that
capitalism was the basic cause of
fascism, personified by the
"avaricious businessman and
demogogic politician."
"We must get the workers to
understand Bloody Thursday,"
said Seale, referring to a massacre
of strikers. He pointed out also
that the weapons of fascism are
being developed in the
universities.

that the weapons of fascism are

"Hear ye, hear ye student
activists," said Seale sarcastically.
"You have been abstracting
ideologically as to what you think
fascism is. Only lately you been
getting a cram course. I suggest
you learn about the experience of
black people."
Again and again during the
three days, speakers were
interrupted by loud applause and
shouts of "Power to the People."
Several of the sessions were
held in Bobby Hutton Memorial
Park in the West Oakland ghetto.
The park was renamed by the
Panthers to honor a member who
was killed by police.
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a black
leader in Chicago who may
radicalize the Southern Christian
Leadership Council (SCLC), gave
a fiery speech at the park Sunday
in the style of a Baptist preacher.
"Eldridge Cleaver says America
is Babylon," said Jackson. "It is
Babylon because of the
impersonal control over personal
lives inside the ghetto."
"Why haven't all blacks been
killed off?" Jackson asked
rhetorically. "Because we are the
margin of profit for every
corporation. Because we are the
soldiers for the army. Because
rascism against blacks is used to
keep the white poor people
down."
The conference lacked all the
formal resolutions which usually
clog the agenda of political
meetings. Seale said he had
received a huge stack of proposed
resolutions, but rejected them all
because he thinks the Front's
resolutions should come after
local committees have actually
gone to work to fight fascism.
"You came here because
something real was
happeni ng~not because of
rhetoric," he told the delegates.
Apparently the Panthers will
continue to make policy for the
United Front. He said the
structure of the Front would be
many local committees
"centralized" by one national
committee, based in Oakland.
About 70 people from
Stanford and Palo Alto attended.
"Hear ye, hear ye student
activists," said Seale sarcastically.
"You have been abstracting
ideologically as to what you think
fascism is. Only lately you been
getting a cram course. I suggest

The Panthers implied that the
campaign would be partly an
educational and organizing tool
against the upsurge of fascist
repression of dissident groups. "If
you get people working, you have
raised them to a higher level of
struggle," said Seale at the
concluding session Sunday.
The Panther's angry words set
the tone for the conference.
"They say we have government
of the people, by the people, for
the people," shouted Seale at the
opening session Friday. "Ha! We
really have government of the
fascists, by the fascists, for the
fascists."
Seale described the terror
campaign waged by the FBI and
other police which has caused the
deaths of 19 Panthers in the past
year. Mass arrests on trumped-up
charges and vandalistic attacks on
Panther offices have been
common.
"We are not calling this United
Front just to save the Black
Panthers," Seale told the
delegates. Concentration camps
for dissidents of all races may be
near, he warned.
Speaker after speaker
emphasized the need for urgent,
unified resistance by
revolutionaries. "We have to
understand and move quickly
with a practical program," said
Seale. "We have no time for a lot
of ideological in-fighting and
bullcrap."
The Panthers showed their own

tolerance of widely differing
political positions by inviting
speakers who ranged from liberals
like Carleton Goodlet to old-line
Communists like Herbert
Aptheker to Maoist
revolutionaries like SDS. The only
group which was excluded from
the program, and later expelled
from some of'the meetings, was
the Progressive Labor Party,
which has condemned the
Panthers as racist and nationalist
on narrow ideological grounds.
The Panther's own politics are
close to SDS. Seale said that
capitalism was the basic cause of
fascism, personified by the
"avaricious businessman and
demogogic politician."
"We must get the workers to
understand Bloody Thursday,"
said Seale, referring to a massacre
of strikers. He pointed out also
that the weapons of fascism are
being developed in the
universities.
"Hear ye, hear ye student
activists," said Seale sarcastically.
"You have been abstracting
ideologically as to what you think
fascism is. Only lately you been
getting a cram course. I suggest
you learn about the experience of
black people."
Again and again during the
three days, speakers were
interrupted by loud applause and
shouts of "Power to the People."
Several of the sessions were
held in Bobby Hutton Memorial
Park in the West Oakland ghetto.
The park was renamed by the
Panthers to honor a member who
was killed by police.
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a black
leader in Chicago who may
radicalize the Southern Christian
Leadership Council (SCLC), gave
a fiery speech at the park Sunday
in the style of a Baptist preacher.
"Eldridge Cleaver says America
is Babylon," said Jackson. "It is
Babylon because of the
impersonal control over personal
lives inside the ghetto."
"Why haven't all blacks been
killed off?" Jackson asked
rhetorically. "Because we are the
margin of profit for every
corporation. Because we are the
soldiers for the army. Because
rascism against blacks is used to
keep the white poor people
down."
The conference lacked all the
formal resolutions which usually
clog the agenda of political
meetings. Seale said he had
received a huge stack of proposed
resolutions, but rejected them all
because he thinks the Front's
resolutions should come after
local committees have actually
gone to work to fight fascism.
"You came here because
something real was
happeni ng~not because of
rhetoric," he told the delegates.
Apparently the Panthers will
continue to make policy for the
United Front. He said the
structure of the Front would be
many local committees
"centralized" by one national
committee, based in Oakland.
About 70 people from
Stanford and Palo Alto attended.
For the first time in modern
American history, the radical
black liberation movement has
joined forces with white radicals
in an alliance against racism,
imperialism and capitalism.
The alliance was made at the
first conference of the new
"United Front Against Fascism,"
in Oakland last weekend,
organized and led by the Black
Panther Party.
About 4,000 delegates, most of
them white, came from all over
the nation to hear three days of
fiery revolutionary rhetoric and a
plan for immediate action.
Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale announced that control of
police would be the Front's first
project. Fifty to one hundred
local "Committees to Combat

Fascism" are expected to begin
campaigns to bring police under
local community control.
Seale told the delegates about a
program underway in Oakland
and Berkeley to break up the
police departments into several
smaller units, each with an elected
governing council. The Panthers
and Peace & Freedom Party are
circulating petitions to put their
amendments to the city charters
on the next ballot. Similar action
was urged for all cities in the
nation.

with a practical program," said
Seale. "We have no time for a lot
of ideological in-fighting and
bullcrap."
The Panthers showed their own

tolerance of widely differing
political positions by inviting
speakers who ranged from liberals
like Carleton Goodlet to old-line
Communists like Herbert
Aptheker to Maoist
revolutionaries like SDS. The only
group which was excluded from
the program, and later expelled
from some of'the meetings, was
the Progressive Labor Party,
which has condemned the
Panthers as racist and nationalist
on narrow ideological grounds.
The Panther's own politics are
close to SDS. Seale said that
capitalism was the basic cause of
fascism, personified by the
"avaricious businessman and
demogogic politician."
"We must get the workers to
understand Bloody Thursday,"
said Seale, referring to a massacre
of strikers. He pointed out also
that the weapons of fascism are
being developed in the
universities.
"Hear ye, hear ye student
activists," said Seale sarcastically.
"You have been abstracting
ideologically as to what you think
fascism is. Only lately you been
getting a cram course. I suggest
you learn about the experience of
black people."
Again and again during the
three days, speakers were
interrupted by loud applause and
shouts of "Power to the People."
Several of the sessions were
held in Bobby Hutton Memorial
Park in the West Oakland ghetto.
The park was renamed by the
Panthers to honor a member who
was killed by police.
Rev. Jesse Jackson, a black
leader in Chicago who may
radicalize the Southern Christian
Leadership Council (SCLC), gave
a fiery speech at the park Sunday
in the style of a Baptist preacher.
"Eldridge Cleaver says America
is Babylon," said Jackson. "It is
Babylon because of the
impersonal control over personal
lives inside the ghetto."
"Why haven't all blacks been
killed off?" Jackson asked
rhetorically. "Because we are the
margin of profit for every
corporation. Because we are the
soldiers for the army. Because
rascism against blacks is used to
keep the white poor people
down."
The conference lacked all the
formal resolutions which usually
clog the agenda of political
meetings. Seale said he had
received a huge stack of proposed
resolutions, but rejected them all
because he thinks the Front's
resolutions should come after
local committees have actually
gone to work to fight fascism.
"You came here because
something real was
happeni ng~not because of
rhetoric," he told the delegates.
Apparently the Panthers will
continue to make policy for the
United Front. He said the
structure of the Front would be
many local committees
"centralized" by one national
committee, based in Oakland.
About 70 people from
Stanford and Palo Alto attended.
For the first time in modern
American history, the radical
black liberation movement has
joined forces with white radicals
in an alliance against racism,
imperialism and capitalism.
The alliance was made at the
first conference of the new
"United Front Against Fascism,"
in Oakland last weekend,
organized and led by the Black
Panther Party.
About 4,000 delegates, most of
them white, came from all over
the nation to hear three days of
fiery revolutionary rhetoric and a
plan for immediate action.
Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale announced that control of
police would be the Front's first
project. Fifty to one hundred
local "Committees to Combat

Fascism" are expected to begin
campaigns to bring police under
local community control.
Seale told the delegates about a
program underway in Oakland
and Berkeley to break up the
police departments into several
smaller units, each with an elected
governing council. The Panthers
and Peace & Freedom Party are
circulating petitions to put their
amendments to the city charters
on the next ballot. Similar action
was urged for all cities in the
nation.
The petition campaign is only a
moderate first step for the Front.
The Panthers implied that the
campaign would be partly an
educational and organizing tool
against the upsurge of fascist
repression of dissident groups. "If
you get people working, you have
raised them to a higher level of
struggle," said Seale at the
concluding session Sunday.
The Panther's angry words set
the tone for the conference.
"They say we have government
of the people, by the people, for
the people," shouted Seale at the
opening session Friday. "Ha! We
really have government of the
fascists, by the fascists, for the
fascists."
Seale described the terror
campaign waged by the FBI and
other police which has caused the
deaths of 19 Panthers in the past
year. Mass arrests on trumped-up
charges and vandalistic attacks on
Panther offices have been
common.
"We are not calling this United
Front just to save the Black
Panthers," Seale told the
delegates. Concentration camps
for dissidents of all races may be
near, he warned.
Speaker after speaker
emphasized the need for urgent,
unified resistance by
revolutionaries. "We have to
understand and move quickly
with a practical program," said
Seale. "We have no time for a lot
of ideological in-fighting and
bullcrap."
