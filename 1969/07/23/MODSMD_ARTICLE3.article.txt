# United Front Against Fascism
## Panther Conference 
### MICHAEL SWEENEY 
For the first time in modern
American history, the radical
black liberation movement has
joined forces with white radicals
in an alliance against racism,
imperialism and capitalism.
The alliance was made at the
first conference of the new
"United Front Against Fascism,"
in Oakland last weekend,
organized and led by the Black
Panther Party.
About 4,000 delegates, most of
them white, came from all over
the nation to hear three days of
fiery revolutionary rhetoric and a
plan for immediate action.
Black Panther chairman Bobby
Seale announced that control of
police would be the Front's first
project. Fifty to one hundred
local "Committees to Combat

Fascism" are expected to begin
campaigns to bring police under
local community control.
Seale told the delegates about a
program underway in Oakland
and Berkeley to break up the
police departments into several
smaller units, each with an elected
governing council. The Panthers
and Peace & Freedom Party are
circulating petitions to put their
amendments to the city charters
on the next ballot. Similar action
was urged for all cities in the
nation.
The petition campaign is only a
moderate first step for the Front.
The Panthers implied that the
campaign would be partly an
educational and organizing tool
against the upsurge of fascist
repression of dissident groups. "If
you get people working, you have
raised them to a higher level of
struggle," said Seale at the
concluding session Sunday.
The Panther's angry words set
the tone for the conference.
"They say we have government
of the people, by the people, for
the people," shouted Seale at the
opening session Friday. "Ha! We
really have government of the
fascists, by the fascists, for the
fascists."
Seale described the terror
campaign waged by the FBI and
other police which has caused the
deaths of 19 Panthers in the past
year. Mass arrests on trumped-up
charges and vandalistic attacks on
Panther offices have been
common.
"We are not calling this United
Front just to save the Black
Panthers," Seale told the
delegates. Concentration camps
for dissidents of all races may be
near, he warned.
Speaker after speaker
emphasized the need for urgent,
unified resistance by
revolutionaries. "We have to
understand and move quickly
with a practical program," said
Seale. "We have no time for a lot
of ideological in-fighting and
bullcrap."
The Panthers showed their own

tolerance of widely differing
political positions by inviting
speakers who ranged from liberals
like Carleton Goodlet to old-line
Communists like Herbert
Aptheker to Maoist
revolutionaries like SDS. The only
group which was excluded from
the program, and later expelled
from some of'the meetings, was
the Progressive Labor Party,
which has condemned the
Panthers as racist and nationalist
on narrow ideological grounds.
The Panther's own politics are
close to SDS. Seale said that
capitalism was the basic cause of
fascism, personified by the
"avaricious businessman and
demogogic politician."
"We must get the workers to
understand Bloody Thursday,"
said Seale, referring to a massacre
of strikers. He pointed out also
that the weapons of fascism are
being developed in the
universities.
