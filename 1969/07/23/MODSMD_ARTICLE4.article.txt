# Gibbons Tops Field For Research VP
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
The search committee for a
vice-president for research will
probably recommend that
Professor of Electrical Engineering
James F. Gibbons be named to
the new post when it meets with
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
sometime this week or next, the
Daily has learned.
Gibbons was selected by the
committee after the Physics
Department vetoed Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
Director Wolfgang K.H. Pabofsky
as a possible nominee.
The job of the research
vice-president, a recently created
post, is not yet fully-defined and,
according to one committee

member, will depend on the
nature of the person chosen, at
least for the beginning.
Gibbons, 33, began teaching at
Stanford in 1957, and worked his
way up to full professor. He had
received his PhD in electrical
engineering in 1956, and spent the
following year at Cambridge as a
Fulbright Fellow.
He is an expert on solid state
devices.
Gibbons served on the Steering
Committee of the Study of
Education at Stanford. He was
considered for the recently-filled
post of Dean of Students. Also,
Gibbons was the originator of a
program under which minority
group workers with industrial
experience but without an
undergraduate degree could study
for a masters in electrical
engineering.
Others considered for the post,
besides Panofsky, were Elliot
Levinthal, director of Prof. Joshua
Lederberg's genetics labs and a
former millionaire electronics
manufacturer; and Prof. William
Miller, professor of computer
science and associate provost for
computing.
Panofsky, who had the
approval of several members of
the search committee, was the
victim of repercussions still arising
from a run-in he had with the
Physics Department when SLAC
was first formed.
Many physics faculty members
opposed setting up SLAC as a
separate entity, preferring to have
it as a part of the department.
Panofsky, who had already been
named SLAC director, fought for
independence and won. He also
sought full faculty status for
SLAC professors—and was also
successful there.
Panofsky, who has been at
Stanford since 1951, participated
in the Manhattan Project during
World War 11. The five foot-two
inch 51 year old physicist has also
been a member of the President's
Science Advisory Committee.

Fulbright Fellow.
He is an expert on solid state
devices.
Gibbons served on the Steering
Committee of the Study of
Education at Stanford. He was
considered for the recently-filled
post of Dean of Students. Also,
Gibbons was the originator of a
program under which minority
group workers with industrial
experience but without an
undergraduate degree could study
for a masters in electrical
engineering.
Others considered for the post,
besides Panofsky, were Elliot
Levinthal, director of Prof. Joshua
Lederberg's genetics labs and a
former millionaire electronics
manufacturer; and Prof. William
Miller, professor of computer
science and associate provost for
computing.
Panofsky, who had the
approval of several members of
the search committee, was the
victim of repercussions still arising
from a run-in he had with the
Physics Department when SLAC
was first formed.
Many physics faculty members
opposed setting up SLAC as a
separate entity, preferring to have
it as a part of the department.
Panofsky, who had already been
named SLAC director, fought for
independence and won. He also
sought full faculty status for
SLAC professors—and was also
successful there.
Panofsky, who has been at
Stanford since 1951, participated
in the Manhattan Project during
World War 11. The five foot-two
inch 51 year old physicist has also
been a member of the President's
Science Advisory Committee.


THERE BUT FOR FORTUNE-James F. Gibbons (left), professor of electrical
engineering, is the top choice of the search committee for a research
vice-president. SLAC Director Wolfgang Panofsky (right) was vetoed by the
Physics Department.

The search committee for a
vice-president for research will
probably recommend that
Professor of Electrical Engineering
James F. Gibbons be named to
the new post when it meets with
President Kenneth S. Pitzer
sometime this week or next, the
Daily has learned.
Gibbons was selected by the
committee after the Physics
Department vetoed Stanford
Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC)
Director Wolfgang K.H. Pabofsky
as a possible nominee.
The job of the research
vice-president, a recently created
post, is not yet fully-defined and,
according to one committee

member, will depend on the
nature of the person chosen, at
least for the beginning.
Gibbons, 33, began teaching at
Stanford in 1957, and worked his
way up to full professor. He had
received his PhD in electrical
engineering in 1956, and spent the
following year at Cambridge as a
Fulbright Fellow.
He is an expert on solid state
devices.
