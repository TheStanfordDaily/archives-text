# A3M Meeting Set; Arrests On Agenda
## 
### 
The April 3rd Movement (A3M) will hold its first meeting this
summer at 7:30 p.m. tonight in the Tresidder small lounge to discuss
the continuing struggle against the research policies at SRI.
A3M has been the target of a harsh backlash from the Santa Clara'
County district attorney in response to the May demonstrations against
SRI. More than 88 people have been arrested on the basis of alleged
identification from photographs at the demonstration, many of them
made by right-wing Stanford students.
One item on the agenda of the A3M meeting will be planning a
fund-raising campaign to support the legal defense of the 88
defendants. Thousands of dollars are needed to support attorneys and
pay other costs.
A new action program will also be discussed. SRl's International
Industrial Conference Sept. 15-20, drawing together 500 top corporate
leaders, has been chosen as a target for demonstrations by radicals
throughout the Bay Area. A3M charges that the conference will serve as
a strategy session for U.S. imperialist economic penetration of
underdeveloped regions.
A3M is expected to play a leading role in the demonstrations at the
SRI conference.
Other topics for the A3M meeting will include plans for a continuing
investigation of objectionable research at SRI and Stanford, and the
question of Stanford's expansion of the Industrial Park into vacant land
instead of building low-cost housing.
The A3M was organized at a mass meeting April 3 at Stanford.
