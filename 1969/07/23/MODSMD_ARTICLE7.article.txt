## New Industrial Park Threatens Coyote Hill 
### 
To The Editor:
The Coyote Hill area, on the southwest corner of Page Mill Road and
Foothill Expressway, is in immediate danger of being paved over and
turned into another industrial park by the University. This hill is a local
landmark, long used by the people of Stanford as an undeveloped park,
close to where we live. The top of the hill offers a wonderful view of
the hills, Santa Clara Valley and the Bay, a peaceful place to have lunch
or spend a while away from the suburban sprawl, getting back in touch
with yourself and the world of nature.
We know that Stanford is under financial pressure to use its land,
but great care should be taken in deciding the appropriate use for each
area lest our hills be covered by industrial parks. Coyote Hill is an area
of great natural advantages, and these areas are scarce. If it must be
developed, the natural beauty must be preserved. We believe there are
various uses of this land, such as a park, and low and middle income
housing clustered so as to leave a good amount of open space,
preferable to manufacturing facilities with their accompanying traffic
and parking lots.
The decision on the Coyote Hill area affects the entire Stanford
community. We believe it should be carefully considered by the people
affected, not just a few in important positions, before a unique part of
our foothills is sacrificed to progress.
