## Surprises From The Moon 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The most important scientific mission of the
Apollo 11 astronauts was to pick up samples of the
moon's surface for study in earth laboratories. This
extension of our scientific reach is not likely to
upset many of our fundamental theories of physics,
chemistry or biology. It will, however, surely put
our knowledge of the earth as a planet on an
unprecedentedly firmer basis by giving us samples of
the kinds of materials from which we have
descended without their having been altered by
weathering or by the pervasive action of living
organisms throughout geological eons. Above all,
these studies are bound to have surprises for us;
many of them, no doubt, will seem simple and
obvious after the fact.
The successful landing may have, in the minds of
many, discharged the "national commitment" that
was, perhaps a necessary impetus to respond to such
a formidable technological challenge. It is only the
beginning of the scientific studies, but these must
now stand on their own feet in asserting their claim
to a proper portion of the national budget. A few
weeks from now we will be much better able to
judge the kind of effort we should continue to put
into the lunar part of space science.

The return sample task has also rekindled a
certain amount of discussion about the hazard of
contaminating the earth with lunar microbes. (This
general subject was introduced for serious scientific
consideration for the first time, as far as I know, in
a paper in Science by Dr. Dean Cowie and myself in
1958, just after Sputnik was launched.) The space
agency has tried to go even beyond its conservative
scientific advisers in setting up precautions for
quarantining the astronauts and the return samples.
This in turn, may have confused some observers into
believing that the precautions were a response to a
real risk.

The main principle that has to be understood is
that the whole program of returning a man from a
lunar landing is based on the conclusion that there is

no risk. We could not mount an effective quarantine
against a real peril of global infection unless we were
prepared to sacrifice the contraband (namely the
astronaut) or send him back, which are unthinkable.
The main argument for zero risk is quite
persuasive: the moon has no atmosphere, and
therefore can have no moisture or other volatile
fluid on its surface, an absolutely necessary
condition for life to flourish. Furthermore,
secondary meteorites have been splashed from
moon to earth many times.
The theoretical risk of lunar infection is perhaps
comparable to that of opening an oil well or
bringing deep sea cores to the surface of the earth.
These materials are far more likely to harbor exotic
forms of life that have been separated from th"
main stream for millions of years.
We face, and do not properly attend to, much
larger risks of global epidemics from monkeys and
other wild animals imported for use in preparing
vaccines.
* * *
The principal purpose of the Apollo quarantine is
to protect the samples from earthly
contamination —not altogether successfully in view
of the exhalations from the landing rocket and from
the astronauts' space suit. It was then reasonable to
throw an anchor to windward and add on whatever
additional precautions against back-contamination
were possible that would not impede the mission.
The entire affair has helped to show that the
present arrangements would be quite inappropriate
to a real risk, for example a sample return from
Mars. Above all it makes the psychological point
that no system of precautions will be properly
enforced, under the pressures of a space mission,
against purely hypothetical threats. The lesson for
our Mars program is that we must learn a great deal
more by instrumented observations, left there,
before we could begin to design the precautions
needed for samples, or men, returned to earth.
