## Next Target: SRI Conference 
### Marc Sapir 
Friday's Daily article concerning the press conference
three of us conducted at SRI left out the principal facts we
were trying to highlight. There is an ongoing and systematic
attempt by SRI, Stanford, and the legal apparatus which
serves them to stop the growth of a strong movement
against Stanford's involvement in U.S. imperialism. The
continual flow of warrants on misdemeanor charges
stemming from a street demonstration in May is
unprecedented. Friday, after I was arrested on medical
ward rounds at the Veterans Administration hospital, I
found out that thirteen new warrants are presently being
issued by the "powers that be".
An explanation for the 80 some odd arrests and 300 odd
charges is necessary. Police forces don't usually sit around
trying to hang 10 misdemeanor charges on a single
individual without the barest of evidence. The explanation I
think comes from the role of SRI in the coordination of the
entire corporate structure of the U.S. By attacking the role
of Stanford and SRI in Vietnam and in the
military-industrial complex, Stanford radicals are biting the
tail of the mighty monster. That viper has gotten annoyed;
he isn't going to bite back yet or the U.S. citizenry might
see his fangs behind a Madison Avenue smile, but he's
flailing his tail around instead.

Let us move from allegory to fact. On September 18,
SRI will sponsor an International Industrial Conference of
the five hundred top corporate leaders in the U.S. (or is it
the free world). Apparently SRI sponsors such conferences
about every 4 years, the last one being held in Manila in
1965. In between SRI sponsors a host of regional big
business conferences, such as the one in Indonesia quite
recently, to deal with the problems of corporate leaders in
penetrating the underdeveloped nations. The lIC will take
place at the Fairmont Hotel in S.F. and it's chairman is
none other than David Rockefeller—of Chase-Manhattan
Bank, South Africa, Latin American Finance-Oil and the
well known Rockefeller Dynasty.
Before we knew about the lIC, Stanford Radicals used a
quote from Jesse Hobson, first SRI president, as the
principal example of U.S. imperialism: "this nation
occupies 6 percent of the land area of the world, has 7
percent of the world's population, but it now produces 50
percent of the world's goods and possesses 67 percent of
the world's wealth," wrote Hobson. "Research must be the
heart, the foundation, the life blood of our present defense
economy if we are to maintain this position," he explained
in 1951.
Currently, we are updating our quotes with one taken
from SRl's 1965 lIC by Alexander N. McFarlane, Chairman

of the Board of Corn Products. According to McFarlane,
the reasons underlying corporate expansion abroad include
"the desire to retain markets which would otherwise be lost
as a result of competitive local manufacture; to ensure
essential raw materials for the domestically based operation
(U.S.A.); to exploit patented or specialized knowledge or
skill; to support or reinforce the domestic manufacturing
operations; and, of course, either to protect existing profits
or to make higher profits because conditions are more
favorable than in the home markets."
SRI, a "non-profit-independent research institute," is a
tax write-off for the giant corporations that sponsor its
work. In return, SRI is the coordinating center for the giant
international monopoly cartels that control the politics as
well as the economics of the U.S.A. This year in S.F. the
corporate leaders will discuss problems primarily associated
with their rationalization and exploitation of the American
people rather than the third world. Some of the topics will
include: "coordinating development efforts of private
business and government, obstacles to private foreign
investment, safeguarding international investments,
improving the public image of private enterprize,
developing feasible alternatives to free collective bargaining
and strikes."
* * *
Of all these topics, copied from an actual agenda, the
attempts to break strikes and breakdown the principle of
collective bargaining is the most ominous. With the
tremendous pace of inflation this may be the only way that
corporate leaders can keep wages down and profits up. And
the predictable attack against the working class will
undoubtedly be disguised in various clothes. Bosses will try
to split the working class, break down rank and file
unionism, control through alliances with union bosses, hire
scabs, pit blacks against whites, unemployed against strikers
and so forth. The recent strikes at Standard Oil, Shell, and
Dow Chemical right here in the bay area are examples of
this kind of effort. And in each case the cops were used by
the companies to try to smash the strikers resistance.
Is it any wonder then, given the true nature of SRI and
the class of vipers it serves, that local radicals should run
into the political harrasment and intimidation that the
continuing arrest campaign represents? The American
people, including the uninvolved students, faculty and
workers on campuses like Stanford, must learn that their
lives and their livelihoods are also controlled by the
all-powerful in this not-so democratic country. After all, it
was these men who, both directly and indirectly, created
the U.S. aggression against the Vietnamese people—using
anti-communism as an excuse. And it was men like them (in

some cases the very same men) who were the main political
and economic power base behind Adolf Hitler.
Misdemeanors for Stanford students, death for James
Rector, exile for Eldrige, jail for Huey, the New York 21,
the Connecticut 7, felony charges against the Conspiracy 8
for the Chicago convention, death to 19 different blacl.
panthers in 6 months, jail for Dave Harris and thousands of
draft resisters, exile for 20,000 or more young men refusing
to serve.
Brothers and Sisters, revolutionaries do not believe in
violence, they merely look around them and see its
inevitability. Those who live for wealth and empire will
never give up their power voluntarily.
