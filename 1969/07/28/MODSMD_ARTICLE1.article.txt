# A3M Holds First Meeting Of Summer
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
Future Stanford land-use
proposals and the University's
probable refusal to allow the April
3 Movement (A3M) to sponsor a
benefit rock concert in Frost
Amphitheater were the key .issues
discussed at Wednesday's A3M
meeting in Tresidder.
Plans were subsequently made
for the issuance of a A3M
statement condemning the
University's denial of the
concert.
The rock program, to be
sponsored by the A3M and the
Free University as a benefit for
the two groups, had been planned
for August 17.
"The people who ought to use
the land," quipped SDS member
Jeanne Friedman, "are the people
who use the land."
"The University doesn't have
the right to keep us away," SDS
leader Fred Cohen added.
"Rumor has it that officials all
over are banning rock concerts
and passing sound-ordinances
because they know that's how the
movement can make money,"
added Lee Herzenberg.
"We were told," stated
Chairman Virginia Lindsley, "that
the noise would bother the people
in Hoover Pavillion and at the
Hospital."
Last year's LASSU speaker,
Yale Braunstein and Mrs.
Herzenberg, further discussed at
length several proposals for using
Stanford land that would be
objectionable to the group.
These proposals include the
giving some 174 Vi acres of Coyote
Point in back of Syntex for
industrial park usage.
This plan has already been
condemned by conservationists in
the area including the Committee
for Green Foothills.

industrial park usage.
This plan has already been
condemned by conservationists in
the area including the Committee
for Green Foothills.
Another land-use proposal is
the building of a financial center
at Page Mill Road and El Camino.
Plans for the 40-acre site
involve constructing two 10-story
office buildings and a 17-story
hotel.
"A group of faculty,"
explained Mrs. Herzenberg, "are
complaining that the traffic from
such a financial center will back
up into the 'faculty ghetto' on
Frenchman's Way.
"In addition," stated
Braunstein, "there's a proposal to
make the corporation yard no
longer available for low-cost
housing."
He pointed out that "a faculty
group and some members of the
City Council are working against
allowing low cost housing on Page
Mill and the Foothill
Expressway."
"Predictions are," Braunstein
continued, "that the extra traffic
and the increased land values will
wipe out part of College Terrace."
"In other words," complained

SDS member Bill Klingel,
"genocide is being waged against
the poor people."
"It's interesting to note,"
another member stated, "that
chairman of the presidential
Committee for Land Use and
Development is (William)
Rambo."
"We should analyze," Cohen
commented, "the ways land use
here is pernicious to what
groups."
Another SDS member, Marc
Heller, noted, "it would be a
revolutionary thing to do to stop
Stanford from doing what it
wants to do with its land."
The results of the Movement's
spring activities were also
discussed.
"One thing that is still carried
over from the spring," Miss
Lindsley told the 40-50 people
present, "is that 88 people have
been busted."
Another A3M member pointed
out that only 15 people had been
arrested on May 16, the date of
the student demonstrations at

SRI. About b-7 people were
subsequently arrested on May 19,
and the rest of the defendants
have been named since that time.
"There have been about 300
charges given out," the member
continued.
Concerning the current state of
classified research on campus,
A3M member Bill Black told the
group that negotiations were
going on "to transfer a number of
AEL contracts over to SRI."
"They should be off-campus
by the fall," one member bitterly
conjectured.
The discussion was highlighted
by some words of condemnation
given by Kief Newman, a visiting
Electrical Engineering professor
from the University of
Pennsylvania, concerning graduate
research projects.
"If you check the titles of
dissertations written by electrical
engineering students here,"
Newman stated, "you'll probably
find that the dissertations aren't
dealing with basic research in
engineering but with actual
engineering—on projects that the
government can often make
money off of."
Newman pointed out that this

"bit of corruption" within
graduate research should be
"exposed in order to purify the
University and improve the caliber
of the research."
''You should expose,"
Newman told the students, "the
degree to which government
funding has changed graduate
research.
"There's been a shift from
seeking new knowledge and
insights to practical work.

"It's not research," Newman
remarked, "but pornography."
Later Newman told the Daily,
"It's true," that all classified
research has been banned from
the University of Pennsylvania,
"but there's a lot of lousy
unclassified research going on in
the form of dissertations."
When asked if Stanford
graduates were engaged in the
same practices, Newman
answered, "I'll bet they are."

"The people who ought to use
the land," quipped SDS member
Jeanne Friedman, "are the people
who use the land."
"The University doesn't have
the right to keep us away," SDS
leader Fred Cohen added.
"Rumor has it that officials all
over are banning rock concerts
and passing sound-ordinances
because they know that's how the
movement can make money,"
added Lee Herzenberg.
"We were told," stated
Chairman Virginia Lindsley, "that
the noise would bother the people
in Hoover Pavillion and at the
Hospital."
Last year's LASSU speaker,
Yale Braunstein and Mrs.
Herzenberg, further discussed at
length several proposals for using
Stanford land that would be
objectionable to the group.
These proposals include the
giving some 174 Vi acres of Coyote
Point in back of Syntex for
industrial park usage.
This plan has already been
condemned by conservationists in
the area including the Committee
for Green Foothills.
Another land-use proposal is
the building of a financial center
at Page Mill Road and El Camino.
Plans for the 40-acre site
involve constructing two 10-story
office buildings and a 17-story
hotel.
"A group of faculty,"
explained Mrs. Herzenberg, "are
complaining that the traffic from
such a financial center will back
up into the 'faculty ghetto' on
Frenchman's Way.
"In addition," stated
Braunstein, "there's a proposal to
make the corporation yard no
longer available for low-cost
housing."
He pointed out that "a faculty
group and some members of the
City Council are working against
allowing low cost housing on Page
Mill and the Foothill
Expressway."
"Predictions are," Braunstein
continued, "that the extra traffic
and the increased land values will
wipe out part of College Terrace."
"In other words," complained

SDS member Bill Klingel,
"genocide is being waged against
the poor people."
"It's interesting to note,"
another member stated, "that
chairman of the presidential
Committee for Land Use and
Development is (William)
Rambo."
"We should analyze," Cohen
commented, "the ways land use
here is pernicious to what
groups."
Another SDS member, Marc
Heller, noted, "it would be a
revolutionary thing to do to stop
Stanford from doing what it
wants to do with its land."
The results of the Movement's
spring activities were also
discussed.
"One thing that is still carried
over from the spring," Miss
Lindsley told the 40-50 people
present, "is that 88 people have
been busted."
Another A3M member pointed
out that only 15 people had been
arrested on May 16, the date of
the student demonstrations at

SRI. About b-7 people were
subsequently arrested on May 19,
and the rest of the defendants
have been named since that time.
"There have been about 300
charges given out," the member
continued.
Concerning the current state of
classified research on campus,
A3M member Bill Black told the
group that negotiations were
going on "to transfer a number of
AEL contracts over to SRI."
"They should be off-campus
by the fall," one member bitterly
conjectured.
The discussion was highlighted
by some words of condemnation
given by Kief Newman, a visiting
Electrical Engineering professor
from the University of
Pennsylvania, concerning graduate
research projects.
"If you check the titles of
dissertations written by electrical
engineering students here,"
Newman stated, "you'll probably
find that the dissertations aren't
dealing with basic research in
engineering but with actual
engineering—on projects that the
government can often make
money off of."
Newman pointed out that this

"bit of corruption" within
graduate research should be
"exposed in order to purify the
University and improve the caliber
of the research."
''You should expose,"
Newman told the students, "the
degree to which government
funding has changed graduate
research.
"There's been a shift from
seeking new knowledge and
insights to practical work.

"It's not research," Newman
remarked, "but pornography."
Later Newman told the Daily,
"It's true," that all classified
research has been banned from
the University of Pennsylvania,
"but there's a lot of lousy
unclassified research going on in
the form of dissertations."
When asked if Stanford
graduates were engaged in the
same practices, Newman
answered, "I'll bet they are."
Future Stanford land-use
proposals and the University's
probable refusal to allow the April
3 Movement (A3M) to sponsor a
benefit rock concert in Frost
Amphitheater were the key .issues
discussed at Wednesday's A3M
meeting in Tresidder.
Plans were subsequently made
for the issuance of a A3M
statement condemning the
University's denial of the
concert.
The rock program, to be
sponsored by the A3M and the
Free University as a benefit for
the two groups, had been planned
for August 17.

Last year's LASSU speaker,
Yale Braunstein and Mrs.
Herzenberg, further discussed at
length several proposals for using
Stanford land that would be
objectionable to the group.
These proposals include the
giving some 174 Vi acres of Coyote
Point in back of Syntex for
industrial park usage.
This plan has already been
condemned by conservationists in
the area including the Committee
for Green Foothills.
Another land-use proposal is
the building of a financial center
at Page Mill Road and El Camino.
Plans for the 40-acre site
involve constructing two 10-story
office buildings and a 17-story
hotel.
"A group of faculty,"
explained Mrs. Herzenberg, "are
complaining that the traffic from
such a financial center will back
up into the 'faculty ghetto' on
Frenchman's Way.
"In addition," stated
Braunstein, "there's a proposal to
make the corporation yard no
longer available for low-cost
housing."
He pointed out that "a faculty
group and some members of the
City Council are working against
allowing low cost housing on Page
Mill and the Foothill
Expressway."
"Predictions are," Braunstein
continued, "that the extra traffic
and the increased land values will
wipe out part of College Terrace."
"In other words," complained

SDS member Bill Klingel,
"genocide is being waged against
the poor people."
"It's interesting to note,"
another member stated, "that
chairman of the presidential
Committee for Land Use and
Development is (William)
Rambo."
"We should analyze," Cohen
commented, "the ways land use
here is pernicious to what
groups."
Another SDS member, Marc
Heller, noted, "it would be a
revolutionary thing to do to stop
Stanford from doing what it
wants to do with its land."
The results of the Movement's
spring activities were also
discussed.
"One thing that is still carried
over from the spring," Miss
Lindsley told the 40-50 people
present, "is that 88 people have
been busted."
Another A3M member pointed
out that only 15 people had been
arrested on May 16, the date of
the student demonstrations at

SRI. About b-7 people were
subsequently arrested on May 19,
and the rest of the defendants
have been named since that time.
"There have been about 300
charges given out," the member
continued.
Concerning the current state of
classified research on campus,
A3M member Bill Black told the
group that negotiations were
going on "to transfer a number of
AEL contracts over to SRI."
"They should be off-campus
by the fall," one member bitterly
conjectured.
The discussion was highlighted
by some words of condemnation
given by Kief Newman, a visiting
Electrical Engineering professor
from the University of
Pennsylvania, concerning graduate
research projects.
"If you check the titles of
dissertations written by electrical
engineering students here,"
Newman stated, "you'll probably
find that the dissertations aren't
dealing with basic research in
engineering but with actual
engineering—on projects that the
government can often make
money off of."
Newman pointed out that this

"bit of corruption" within
graduate research should be
"exposed in order to purify the
University and improve the caliber
of the research."
''You should expose,"
Newman told the students, "the
degree to which government
funding has changed graduate
research.
"There's been a shift from
seeking new knowledge and
insights to practical work.

"It's not research," Newman
remarked, "but pornography."
Later Newman told the Daily,
"It's true," that all classified
research has been banned from
the University of Pennsylvania,
"but there's a lot of lousy
unclassified research going on in
the form of dissertations."
When asked if Stanford
graduates were engaged in the
same practices, Newman
answered, "I'll bet they are."
Future Stanford land-use
proposals and the University's
probable refusal to allow the April
3 Movement (A3M) to sponsor a
benefit rock concert in Frost
Amphitheater were the key .issues
discussed at Wednesday's A3M
meeting in Tresidder.
Plans were subsequently made
for the issuance of a A3M
statement condemning the
University's denial of the
concert.
The rock program, to be
sponsored by the A3M and the
Free University as a benefit for
the two groups, had been planned
for August 17.
"The people who ought to use
the land," quipped SDS member
Jeanne Friedman, "are the people
who use the land."
"The University doesn't have
the right to keep us away," SDS
leader Fred Cohen added.
"Rumor has it that officials all
over are banning rock concerts
and passing sound-ordinances
because they know that's how the
movement can make money,"
added Lee Herzenberg.
"We were told," stated
Chairman Virginia Lindsley, "that
the noise would bother the people
in Hoover Pavillion and at the
Hospital."
