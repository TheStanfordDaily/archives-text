Future Stanford land-use
proposals and the University's
probable refusal to allow the April
3 Movement (A3M) to sponsor a
benefit rock concert in Frost
Amphitheater were the key .issues
discussed at Wednesday's A3M
meeting in Tresidder.
Plans were subsequently made
for the issuance of a A3M
statement condemning the
University's denial of the
concert.
The rock program, to be
sponsored by the A3M and the
Free University as a benefit for
the two groups, had been planned
for August 17.
"The people who ought to use
the land," quipped SDS member
Jeanne Friedman, "are the people
who use the land."
"The University doesn't have
the right to keep us away," SDS
leader Fred Cohen added.
"Rumor has it that officials all
over are banning rock concerts
and passing sound-ordinances
because they know that's how the
movement can make money,"
added Lee Herzenberg.
"We were told," stated
Chairman Virginia Lindsley, "that
the noise would bother the people
in Hoover Pavillion and at the
Hospital."
Last year's LASSU speaker,
Yale Braunstein and Mrs.
Herzenberg, further discussed at
length several proposals for using
Stanford land that would be
objectionable to the group.
These proposals include the
giving some 174 Vi acres of Coyote
Point in back of Syntex for
industrial park usage.
This plan has already been
condemned by conservationists in
the area including the Committee
for Green Foothills.
