# Summer Festival
## 'The Concept' Opens Monday 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
"The Concept" opens with a
young addict enduring the
physical agony of - withdrawal in
jail, and the equally painful
experience of coming to face
himself at Daytop Village, a
rehabilitation center for drug
addicts in Staten Island, N.Y. His
teachers are members of the
community who have been there
longer, and they are far from
gentle.
In grueling encounters they
force him to crack through his
nonchalant facade, although they
careful not to break his will.
~hen his image starts breaking
from their probing questions,
"Whaddya call a guy who gets
busted, comes out and gets busted
again, Roger?" they all laugh with
relief and ti e audience does, too.
The reality of this play,
performed by eight former heroin
addicts, far exceeds that of
conventional theater.
"The Concept" opens Monday
night in the Tent Theater, on the
lawn outside Memorial Hall. It

will play through Sunday, August
3, with members of the
long-running New York
production. To meet the demand
for additional performances, three
separate casts have been formed.
Together they have experienced
176 years of heroin addiction.
They have spent a total of 41
years in jails. As a group they have
completed 32 drug-free years at
Daytop. The average age of the
players is 25.
The Director of "The
Concept," Lawrence Sacharow, is
a professional director on the
Daytop staff, who formed a
theater company among the
former addicts as a therapy
measure.
The play evolved as a total
group effort. Each scene was
improvised and worked upon. The
improvisations were tape
recorded, and a script was finally
created. The play derives from
both actors and director working
together in their community.
Through the use of the
"pressure cooker" or the

encounter group which takes
place three limes a week, the
addict's defenses are pared down
and he is forced to work toward a
new self image at Daytop.
One member after another is
assigned the hot seat where he is
attacked and criticized for failing
to adhere to basic precepts of
Daytop (no drugs and no
violence) and for being insensitive

to the feelings of others. David
Deitch, the 35-year-old director of
Daytop, says,"the encounter is a
gut-level teaching device that
speeds up personality alteration,
just as a pressure cooker speeds up
the preparation of food."
In one scene a girl is forced
publicly to choose the person to
whom she feels closest in the
room and then ask him to love
her. Dan Sullivan, New York
Times critic, writes: "As she pouts
and blushes and picks at her
hands, the elements of self and
not-self visibly battling for the

possession of her soul, the silence
of the audience is profound.
"We suffer and stall with her,
and when the play ends we feel
that we have come through some
very heavy weather with some
people that we will never forget.
The Concept is a wonderful
commercial for Daytop, and an
even better one for the human
race."
Members of the Daytop
Theater Company will discuss
"The Concept" at a briefing
session at 4:30 p.m., Wednesday,
in the Tresidder Lounge.

One member after another is
assigned the hot seat where he is
attacked and criticized for failing
to adhere to basic precepts of
Daytop (no drugs and no
violence) and for being insensitive

to the feelings of others. David
Deitch, the 35-year-old director of
Daytop, says,"the encounter is a
gut-level teaching device that
speeds up personality alteration,
just as a pressure cooker speeds up
the preparation of food."
In one scene a girl is forced
publicly to choose the person to
whom she feels closest in the
room and then ask him to love
her. Dan Sullivan, New York
Times critic, writes: "As she pouts
and blushes and picks at her
hands, the elements of self and
not-self visibly battling for the

possession of her soul, the silence
of the audience is profound.
"We suffer and stall with her,
and when the play ends we feel
that we have come through some
very heavy weather with some
people that we will never forget.
The Concept is a wonderful
commercial for Daytop, and an
even better one for the human
race."
Members of the Daytop
Theater Company will discuss
"The Concept" at a briefing
session at 4:30 p.m., Wednesday,
in the Tresidder Lounge.
"The Concept" opens with a
young addict enduring the
physical agony of - withdrawal in
jail, and the equally painful
experience of coming to face
himself at Daytop Village, a
rehabilitation center for drug
addicts in Staten Island, N.Y. His
teachers are members of the
community who have been there
longer, and they are far from
gentle.
In grueling encounters they
force him to crack through his
nonchalant facade, although they
careful not to break his will.
~hen his image starts breaking
from their probing questions,
"Whaddya call a guy who gets
busted, comes out and gets busted
again, Roger?" they all laugh with
relief and ti e audience does, too.
The reality of this play,
performed by eight former heroin
addicts, far exceeds that of
conventional theater.
"The Concept" opens Monday
night in the Tent Theater, on the
lawn outside Memorial Hall. It

will play through Sunday, August
3, with members of the
long-running New York
production. To meet the demand
for additional performances, three
separate casts have been formed.
Together they have experienced
176 years of heroin addiction.
They have spent a total of 41
years in jails. As a group they have
completed 32 drug-free years at
Daytop. The average age of the
players is 25.
The Director of "The
Concept," Lawrence Sacharow, is
a professional director on the
Daytop staff, who formed a
theater company among the
former addicts as a therapy
measure.
The play evolved as a total
group effort. Each scene was
improvised and worked upon. The
improvisations were tape
recorded, and a script was finally
created. The play derives from
both actors and director working
together in their community.
Through the use of the
"pressure cooker" or the

encounter group which takes
place three limes a week, the
addict's defenses are pared down
and he is forced to work toward a
new self image at Daytop.
