The Dean of Students has
announced the following policy
change on married student
housing for the 1969-70 academic
year:
To be eligible for married
student housing, either the
husband or the wife must be a
Stanford student. Couples now
living in Escondido Village should
recognize that if one member of
the family completes a terminal
degree, eligibility continues so
long as the second member of the
household is a Stanford student.
