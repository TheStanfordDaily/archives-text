# Stanford's Summer Invaders Include High School Seniors
## 
### HEIDI YORKSHIRE 
The influx of invaders from all
over the country hcis hit Stanford.
Some regular students have
even been threatening to sell
buttons reading "I go here in the
winter," the invasion is so large.
Among the students who are
wearing Stanford T-shirts this
summer are a group of about 30
members of the high school class
of 1970.
These high school seniors are
enrolled in regular Stanford
courses and are getting college
credit for between eight and ten
units of work, and, more
""Tiportant, are being exposed to
the academic demands and social
atmosphere of a university
situation.
Three years ago, when the High
School Summer Visitor program
started, there was concern over
whether a secondary school
student could handle the
academic problems that must be
faced on the college level. But,
according to Berkeley Driesel,
who is one of the administrators
of the program, there have been
no serious problems on the
academic end.
"The reason academic
problems are minor," Driesel
commented, "is that the program
is under an annual process of
evaluation. This evaluation
includes four areas: the students'
academic success, the reactions of
faculty members to the high
school seniors in their classes, the
contributions they make to the
Stanford community, and
feedback from the participants
themselves. In all these areas,
results have been extremely
favorable."
Cornell, Harvard, USC, UCSB,
and many other universities
conduct similar programs, but
most of them are highly
structured, taking on the aspect of
an upper-level summer camp.
When asked why the Stanford
program is so > unstructured in
comparison, Driesel replied, "This
situation was especially designed
to provide a maximum of
flexibility, a quality which is part
of the institutional character of
Stanford. We wanted to let high
aptitude students who appear to
be able to profit from the work
become used to the atmosphere of
the university."

Dean of Students Sally
Mahoney reinforced DriesePs
comments, saying, "We try to
communicate to applicants that
they are coming to a university
environment and to make it clear
that both academically and
personally the university is an
adult community.
"Through this emphasis, we get
.a self-selected group of high
school seniors who've taken the
community into consideration
when they applied. And the
students have done a very good
job of self-selection, as they have
made friends among a wide range
of students, and had a number of
beneficial experiences."
For the most part, the students
themselves are enthusiastic about
the experience of Stanford
summer school. Although some
have expressed the viewpoint that
they'd rather be "sluffing off on
the beach this summer," many
agree with the opinion of Chriss
McCann, a student at Beverly Hills
High School, who remarked,
"This is what I thought college
would be about.
"When a teacher can invite a
whole class over just to get to
know each other, not only is there
a greater rapport between
students and faculty, but the
students themselves can become
closer and relate more easily."
Nine of the high school visitors
on campus this summer are from
Beverly Hills High School, and
others come from New Jersey,
New York, Nebraska, and
Louisiana. To many the
outstanding feature of this
summer is exposure to a wide
range of experiences, and the
opportunity to make their own
decisions scholastically and
socially.
"The flexibility of the program
is just great," said Tina Johnston
of Sir Francis Drake High School
in San Anselmo. "It is so
comfortable to know that you can
go to a college professor and place
yourself according to your ability,

not to any inflexible guidelines
based on age."
Despite almost unanimous
enthusiasm, this summer has not
been without problems for the
participants. One girl has spent
three weeks in the infirmary with
mononucleosis, and one of the
boys had his appendix out to
celebrate the Fourth of July.
