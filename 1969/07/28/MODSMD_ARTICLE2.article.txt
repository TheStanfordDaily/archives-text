## McClellan Bill Opposed Here 
### BILL EVERS 
There was no evidence of
anything at Stanford which could
be interpreted as a favorable
response after Senator John L.
McClellan (D-Ark.) presented a
bill last Tuesday to Congress
designed to deal with the student
dissidents' demonstrations which
his Permanent Investigations
Subcommittee has been studying.
But reasons for opposing the bill
varied widely.
The bill McClellan filed would
make it a federal offense to
interrupt, disrupt, or obstruct the
operation of federally aided
institutions of higher learning.
Almost every college and
university in the United States
receives federal aid in one form or
another.

If enacted, McClellan's measure
would provide penalties ranging
from $500 fines and 90 days in
jail to fines of $10,000 and life
imprisonment if there were deaths
as a result of the disruptions.
Men from Stanford who had
testified before McClellan in
Washington at the beginning of
this month had similar reactions.
Friedenthal Comments
Law professor Jack
Friedenthal, chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council, told
The Daily yesterday evening that
he did not think that McClellan's
bill made much sense.Friedenthal
said: "I don't support it. And in
the end I don't think it will pass.
Friedenthal contended further
that the case for "private ordering
within the universities" has not

been invalidated by events.
Friedenthal added that "in
order to preserve a free and open
university" there should not be
federal laws of this kind with such
a "hash series of penalties" which
will deter people from
participating in political
demonstrations. Friedenthal
pointed out that one cannot know
beforehand whether a policeman
will fire into a crowd and kill
demonstrators.
Charles Anderson, director of
Stanford Research Institute, said,
speaking "as an individual" and
not as an SRI spokesman, that he
supported completely the stand
taken by President Kenneth Pitzer
and other Stanford officials in
their testimony before the

MOVING IN—The new trailer colony next to Branner Hall is finally beginning to
be assembled. The fifty-odd units will house undergraduates in the fall, and lake a
little of the pressure off the housing squeeze.
