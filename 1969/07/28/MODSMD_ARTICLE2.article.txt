# Campus Reaction
## McClellan Bill Opposed Here 
### BILL EVERS 
There was no evidence of
anything at Stanford which could
be interpreted as a favorable
response after Senator John L.
McClellan (D-Ark.) presented a
bill last Tuesday to Congress
designed to deal with the student
dissidents' demonstrations which
his Permanent Investigations
Subcommittee has been studying.
But reasons for opposing the bill
varied widely.
The bill McClellan filed would
make it a federal offense to
interrupt, disrupt, or obstruct the
operation of federally aided
institutions of higher learning.
Almost every college and
university in the United States
receives federal aid in one form or
another.

If enacted, McClellan's measure
would provide penalties ranging
from $500 fines and 90 days in
jail to fines of $10,000 and life
imprisonment if there were deaths
as a result of the disruptions.
Men from Stanford who had
testified before McClellan in
Washington at the beginning of
this month had similar reactions.
Friedenthal Comments
Law professor Jack
Friedenthal, chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council, told
The Daily yesterday evening that
he did not think that McClellan's
bill made much sense.Friedenthal
said: "I don't support it. And in
the end I don't think it will pass.
Friedenthal contended further
that the case for "private ordering
within the universities" has not

been invalidated by events.
Friedenthal added that "in
order to preserve a free and open
university" there should not be
federal laws of this kind with such
a "hash series of penalties" which
will deter people from
participating in political
demonstrations. Friedenthal
pointed out that one cannot know
beforehand whether a policeman
will fire into a crowd and kill
demonstrators.
Charles Anderson, director of
Stanford Research Institute, said,
speaking "as an individual" and
not as an SRI spokesman, that he
supported completely the stand
taken by President Kenneth Pitzer
and other Stanford officials in
their testimony before the

McClellan committee. According
to Anderson, universities "should
and can exercise the appropriate
control."
William Rambo, director of
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
expressed disappointment over
McClellan's move. He said it was
not the course of action he
thought appropriate, and that he
found McClellan's plan "neither
feasible nor constructive." Rambo
added that he wondered if
McClellan "thinks he will get it
passed."
Students differed in their
assessment of the situation.
Leonard Siegel, a member of
Stanford SDS said, "Considering
what else is happening in the rest
of the country, it is not
surprising." He described
McClellan's move as
"centralization of power," but
pointed out that "the liberals who
oppose it are going to press for
local laws to do the same thing."
Jim Schnieder of the Coalition
for an Academic Community said

he could understand how the
federal government became
concerned when disruptions
spilled over from the universities
into the neighboring communities
and when students receiving
federal aid were unable because of
campus disruptions to
"participate meaningfully" in the
normal work of the university
communities.
Schnieder maintained,
however, that in order for
disruptions to cease, it was
necessary that these matters be
handled locally.
He said he favored the
imposition of "strong penalties on
those who violate university
policies and civil laws." But he
was afraid that the McClellan bill
would prove to be
"unenforceable."
Schnieder indicated that he felt
that if the McClellan bill passed,
university administrators, would
be "less apt to charge students"
with violations. Schnieder
predicted that if passed, the bill
would further alienate students
from the federal government.
Neal Okabayashi, a member of
the Third World Liberation Front
offered these comments: "As the
brothers and sisters intensify the
struggle for freedom, we can
expect fascist pigs like McClellan
to increase their efforts to vamp
on the people. Certainly, this is
not the final solution that
McClellan will propose, but Third

World people fully realize that
America is quite capable of
genocide and concentration
camps —witness the Indians and
Japanese —and we will not march
to the showers.

There was no evidence of
anything at Stanford which could
be interpreted as a favorable
response after Senator John L.
McClellan (D-Ark.) presented a
bill last Tuesday to Congress
designed to deal with the student
dissidents' demonstrations which
his Permanent Investigations
Subcommittee has been studying.
But reasons for opposing the bill
varied widely.
The bill McClellan filed would
make it a federal offense to
interrupt, disrupt, or obstruct the
operation of federally aided
institutions of higher learning.
Almost every college and
university in the United States
receives federal aid in one form or
another.

If enacted, McClellan's measure
would provide penalties ranging
from $500 fines and 90 days in
jail to fines of $10,000 and life
imprisonment if there were deaths
as a result of the disruptions.
Men from Stanford who had
testified before McClellan in
Washington at the beginning of
this month had similar reactions.
Friedenthal Comments
Law professor Jack
Friedenthal, chairman of the
Stanford Judicial Council, told
The Daily yesterday evening that
he did not think that McClellan's
bill made much sense.Friedenthal
said: "I don't support it. And in
the end I don't think it will pass.
Friedenthal contended further
that the case for "private ordering
within the universities" has not

been invalidated by events.
Friedenthal added that "in
order to preserve a free and open
university" there should not be
federal laws of this kind with such
a "hash series of penalties" which
will deter people from
participating in political
demonstrations. Friedenthal
pointed out that one cannot know
beforehand whether a policeman
will fire into a crowd and kill
demonstrators.
Charles Anderson, director of
Stanford Research Institute, said,
speaking "as an individual" and
not as an SRI spokesman, that he
supported completely the stand
taken by President Kenneth Pitzer
and other Stanford officials in
their testimony before the

little of the pressure off the housing squeeze.
McClellan committee. According
to Anderson, universities "should
and can exercise the appropriate
control."
William Rambo, director of
Stanford Electronics Laboratories
expressed disappointment over
McClellan's move. He said it was
not the course of action he
thought appropriate, and that he
found McClellan's plan "neither
feasible nor constructive." Rambo
added that he wondered if
McClellan "thinks he will get it
passed."
Students differed in their
assessment of the situation.
Leonard Siegel, a member of
Stanford SDS said, "Considering
what else is happening in the rest
of the country, it is not
surprising." He described
McClellan's move as
"centralization of power," but
pointed out that "the liberals who
oppose it are going to press for
local laws to do the same thing."
Jim Schnieder of the Coalition
for an Academic Community said

he could understand how the
federal government became
concerned when disruptions
spilled over from the universities
into the neighboring communities
and when students receiving
federal aid were unable because of
campus disruptions to
"participate meaningfully" in the
normal work of the university
communities.
Schnieder maintained,
however, that in order for
disruptions to cease, it was
necessary that these matters be
handled locally.
He said he favored the
imposition of "strong penalties on
those who violate university
policies and civil laws." But he
was afraid that the McClellan bill
would prove to be
"unenforceable."
Schnieder indicated that he felt
that if the McClellan bill passed,
university administrators, would
be "less apt to charge students"
with violations. Schnieder
predicted that if passed, the bill
would further alienate students
from the federal government.
Neal Okabayashi, a member of
the Third World Liberation Front
offered these comments: "As the
brothers and sisters intensify the
struggle for freedom, we can
expect fascist pigs like McClellan
to increase their efforts to vamp
on the people. Certainly, this is
not the final solution that
McClellan will propose, but Third

World people fully realize that
America is quite capable of
genocide and concentration
camps —witness the Indians and
Japanese —and we will not march
to the showers.
''If up-tight, myopic
motherfuckers like McClellan
could see where we were coming
from, he would know that the
only violence in this society is the
violence perpetrated by this racist,
capitalist system."
