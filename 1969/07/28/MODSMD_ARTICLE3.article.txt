# Senate Discusses Undergraduate Dean
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
The Academic Senate opened
its doors to the campus for the
first time yesterday as the faculty
body heard testimony on the
proposal for a dean of
undergraduate studies (DUS).
Representatives of the Daily
and Campus Report, as well as
several visiting students, faculty
members, and staff members
heard the floor management
committee present several
arguments in favor of the new
deanship, as well as one against it.
The campus radio station,
KZSU, also may send a
representative, but did not do so
this time since it is not
broadcasting during the summer.
Much of the discussion on the
DUS centered on what budgetary
powers and leverage the new dean
would have, and the overlap
between his office and those of
the deans of the various schools.

Stating that the present set-up
was doing alright, Associate
Professor of Religion Edwin M.
Good noted that the idea behind
the new organizational proposal
was "not to make a bad one good,
but to make a good one better.
"In recent years," he added,
"it looks to me like a holding of
the line in undergraduate
education," while needed
expansions and improvements are
made on the graduate level.
"It's not true that we pay no
attention to undergraduates, but
on the balance we don't pay
enough attention to them.
Establishing a dean of
undergraduate studies is an
important symbolic move, to
show we wish to pay attention to
undergraduate education as we do
to graduate education."
Michael Sweeney, senior in
psychology and former Daily
editor, brought about round
laughter among the senators with
some of his comments.
He suggested that there were
two alternatives the Senate could
set up. One was to establish a
truly symbolic post, and to select
a professor "about two years
short of emeritus" for the
position, one who was known to
have a good "father-son
relationship with his students."
Or, Sweeney added, they could
recommend an independent
administrator, reporting to the
provost, who would be seriously
involved in budgeting,
promotions, and innovations.
For such a job, Sweeney urged,
they should have "an energetic
associate professor, one who can
smoke grass with the students and
also play the game of academic
politics."
Lorie Tarshis, head of the
Economics Department, was not
present to deliver his
testimony —the only one opposed
