# Stanford Slates Land For Industry
## 
### YALE M. BRAUNSTEIN 
The Stanford Industrial Park is expanding and
previously undeveloped areas in the hills are slated
for industrial and scientific research tenants. This is
but one of many changes in land use the Stanford
land developers have in mind for this summer.
Other major parcels for which planning is under
way include the proposed new financial center at El
Camino and Page Mill, and the old Palo Alto City
Corporation Yard near the Southern Pacific Depot.
All three will be discussed by Palo Alto's City
Planning Commission on July 30.
Each of the various proposals has its own set of
proponents and opponents, with the Business
Affairs Office at Stanford pushing further
development. Several conservation groups, including
the "Committee for Green Foothills," an
organization with membership from most areas of
the Peninsula, have expressed opposition to further
industrialization of the hills. The group especially
wants to preserve the Coyote Hill area, bounded by
Foothill Road, Page Mill Expressway, Arastadero
Road, and Hillview Avenue.
Stanford has filed a map with the Planning
Commission dividing the Coyote Hill area into four
parcels of 174.5 acres. The new plan is to divide
three of those parcels into 14 areas of between 6.1

and 15.5 acre lots. Two new roads are already being
cut into the hill.
One parcel is on top of Coyote Hill itself. The
top 28 acres are scheduled to be "reserve" or
undeveloped, and two acres will be Stanford's
contribution to a Stanford-Syntex animal research
facility. The adjoining 7.2 acres will be leased to
Syntex. Stanford scientists have not yet received
funding for the project, although Syntex will
undoubtedly proceed with construction of the
buildings. Leonard Herzenberg, one of the scientists
involved with the center expressed concern over the
appropriateness of locating the animal facility in the
center of an "industrial park." He said that he "had
originally been given the impression that the
surrounding land was to be kept in its natural
state."
The proposed financial center at Page Mill and El
Camino has run into several delays because the
wrong zoning changes were asked for originally. In a
letter to the Palo Alto Planning Commission, Vice
President for Business Affairs Alf E. Brandin agreed
that the lot not fronting on El Camino carry a PC
(project —specific) classification. But this would
require a PC zoning for the front lot, although it
was already zoned as suitable for the financial
center. The PC zoning allows the Planning
Commission to have control over the project during

its construction and requires that
the university seek Commission
approval for major changes in the
proposal.
Objections to the financial
center have been many. They
include more traffic on El Camino
and Page Mill, the trend toward
high-rises in Palo Alto (the center
will have a 10-story) and finally it
is across the street from one of
the possible low-rent housing
sites.
That the need for low-rent
housing should have the first
priority for Stanford lands is one
argument being used against the
proposals. The city previously
agreed to wait six months for a
housing proposal before doing
anything with the old Corporation
Yard it leased from Stanford.
Since no proposal has been
submitted, this site will also be on

the agenda of the July 30
Planning Commission meeting.
The proponents of more
low-rent housing are at this time
quite pessimistic about their
chances. At the same time, they
are claiming an ever increasing
need with more workers in the
Coyote Hill extension of the
Industrial Park and in the
financial center. Possible areas for
the housing would include the
other corner of Page Mill and El
Camino, the Corporation Yard,
the blocks between El Camino
and Park Boulevard off of the
Oregon Expressway (the
continuation of Page Mill, and the
area across from the new faculty
housing area at Page Mill and
Foothill expressway). All except
the last eure in Palo Alto, and it
has been predicted that if the Page
Mil!— Foothill Expressway area
were developed it would be
annexed to the city.

proposals. The city previously
agreed to wait six months for a
housing proposal before doing
anything with the old Corporation
Yard it leased from Stanford.
Since no proposal has been
submitted, this site will also be on

the agenda of the July 30
Planning Commission meeting.
The proponents of more
low-rent housing are at this time
quite pessimistic about their
chances. At the same time, they
are claiming an ever increasing
need with more workers in the
Coyote Hill extension of the
Industrial Park and in the
financial center. Possible areas for
the housing would include the
other corner of Page Mill and El
Camino, the Corporation Yard,
the blocks between El Camino
and Park Boulevard off of the
Oregon Expressway (the
continuation of Page Mill, and the
area across from the new faculty
housing area at Page Mill and
Foothill expressway). All except
the last eure in Palo Alto, and it
has been predicted that if the Page
Mil!— Foothill Expressway area
were developed it would be
annexed to the city.
The Stanford Industrial Park is expanding and
previously undeveloped areas in the hills are slated
for industrial and scientific research tenants. This is
but one of many changes in land use the Stanford
land developers have in mind for this summer.
Other major parcels for which planning is under
way include the proposed new financial center at El
Camino and Page Mill, and the old Palo Alto City
Corporation Yard near the Southern Pacific Depot.
All three will be discussed by Palo Alto's City
Planning Commission on July 30.
Each of the various proposals has its own set of
proponents and opponents, with the Business
Affairs Office at Stanford pushing further
development. Several conservation groups, including
the "Committee for Green Foothills," an
organization with membership from most areas of
the Peninsula, have expressed opposition to further
industrialization of the hills. The group especially
wants to preserve the Coyote Hill area, bounded by
Foothill Road, Page Mill Expressway, Arastadero
Road, and Hillview Avenue.
Stanford has filed a map with the Planning
Commission dividing the Coyote Hill area into four
parcels of 174.5 acres. The new plan is to divide
three of those parcels into 14 areas of between 6.1

and 15.5 acre lots. Two new roads are already being
cut into the hill.
One parcel is on top of Coyote Hill itself. The
top 28 acres are scheduled to be "reserve" or
undeveloped, and two acres will be Stanford's
contribution to a Stanford-Syntex animal research
facility. The adjoining 7.2 acres will be leased to
Syntex. Stanford scientists have not yet received
funding for the project, although Syntex will
undoubtedly proceed with construction of the
buildings. Leonard Herzenberg, one of the scientists
involved with the center expressed concern over the
appropriateness of locating the animal facility in the
center of an "industrial park." He said that he "had
originally been given the impression that the
surrounding land was to be kept in its natural
state."
The proposed financial center at Page Mill and El
Camino has run into several delays because the
wrong zoning changes were asked for originally. In a
letter to the Palo Alto Planning Commission, Vice
President for Business Affairs Alf E. Brandin agreed
that the lot not fronting on El Camino carry a PC
(project —specific) classification. But this would
require a PC zoning for the front lot, although it
was already zoned as suitable for the financial
center. The PC zoning allows the Planning
Commission to have control over the project during

its construction and requires that
the university seek Commission
approval for major changes in the
proposal.
Objections to the financial
center have been many. They
include more traffic on El Camino
and Page Mill, the trend toward
high-rises in Palo Alto (the center
will have a 10-story) and finally it
is across the street from one of
the possible low-rent housing
sites.
That the need for low-rent
