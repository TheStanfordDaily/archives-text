# Stanford Slates Land For Industry
## 
### YALE M. BRAUNSTEIN 
The Stanford Industrial Park is expanding and
previously undeveloped areas in the hills are slated
for industrial and scientific research tenants. This is
but one of many changes in land use the Stanford
land developers have in mind for this summer.
Other major parcels for which planning is under
way include the proposed new financial center at El
Camino and Page Mill, and the old Palo Alto City
Corporation Yard near the Southern Pacific Depot.
All three will be discussed by Palo Alto's City
Planning Commission on July 30.
Each of the various proposals has its own set of
proponents and opponents, with the Business
Affairs Office at Stanford pushing further
development. Several conservation groups, including
the "Committee for Green Foothills," an
organization with membership from most areas of
the Peninsula, have expressed opposition to further
industrialization of the hills. The group especially
wants to preserve the Coyote Hill area, bounded by
Foothill Road, Page Mill Expressway, Arastadero
Road, and Hillview Avenue.
Stanford has filed a map with the Planning
Commission dividing the Coyote Hill area into four
parcels of 174.5 acres. The new plan is to divide
three of those parcels into 14 areas of between 6.1

and 15.5 acre lots. Two new roads are already being
cut into the hill.
One parcel is on top of Coyote Hill itself. The
top 28 acres are scheduled to be "reserve" or
undeveloped, and two acres will be Stanford's
contribution to a Stanford-Syntex animal research
facility. The adjoining 7.2 acres will be leased to
Syntex. Stanford scientists have not yet received
funding for the project, although Syntex will
undoubtedly proceed with construction of the
buildings. Leonard Herzenberg, one of the scientists
involved with the center expressed concern over the
appropriateness of locating the animal facility in the
center of an "industrial park." He said that he "had
originally been given the impression that the
surrounding land was to be kept in its natural
state."
The proposed financial center at Page Mill and El
Camino has run into several delays because the
wrong zoning changes were asked for originally. In a
letter to the Palo Alto Planning Commission, Vice
President for Business Affairs Alf E. Brandin agreed
that the lot not fronting on El Camino carry a PC
(project —specific) classification. But this would
require a PC zoning for the front lot, although it
was already zoned as suitable for the financial
center. The PC zoning allows the Planning
Commission to have control over the project during

to build an ?xtennon on the Industrial Park. Other projects are planned for other
parcels of Stanford land.
