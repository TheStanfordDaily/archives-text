The following is a letter to President
Kenneth S. Pitzer from Barry Askinas,
a member of the ASSU Council of
Presidents. 11 concerns a statement by
Pitzer that students placed on
probation for involvement in campus
disruptions may not hold positions of
trust and responsibility. This
proclamation affects tutors, teaching
fellows, resident assistants, and
sponsors.—Editor.
As your statement affects
graduate students appointed
either to positions as teaching
fellows or as resident assistants
and tutors, I would suggest that
your statement represents an
incursion into what is loosely
called academic freedom.
Especially as this regards graduate
students appointed to the
faculty-like position of teaching
fellow where one would expect
that the sole criteria are academic
qualifications, your policy would
introduce extra-academic
considerations.
Again with respect to positions
in the residence system, one

would expect that the normal
selection procedure has produced
a group of graduate students that
are qualified to hold these
positions. In this case, you are
implying that the staff of the
Dean of Students is not qualified
to recognize who should and
should not hold positions of
responsibility. In the case of
teaching fellows, you are implying
that the faculty and chairmen of
particular departments are not
qualified to decide who can and
cannot teach a course. It strikes
me as a very bad precedent to
have political considerations enter
into the selection of academic
teachers. So long as a student has
not been severed from this
academic community, he should
be allowed to perform any and all
functions within the academic
sphere without penalty and
without stigma attached to him
because of extra-curricular
activities.
