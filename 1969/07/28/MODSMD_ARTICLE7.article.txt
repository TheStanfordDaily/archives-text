Panofsky & Physics
To the Editor:
The story in the Stanford Daily
of Wednesday, July 23 in regard
to the position of Vice President
for Research contains two
important errors of fact. First, the
Physics Department did not veto
the nomination of Professor
Panofsky for this position.
Indeed, the Department did not
meet on this matter and did not
act for or against any nominee. It
is my understanding that a
number of individual members of
various departments in the
Stanford Community were
consulted concerning the duties
associated with this position and
the qualifications of possible
nominees, and that they expressed
their personal opinions.
Second, the Daily story states
that "many Physics faculty
members opposed setting up
SLAC as a separate entity,
preferring to have it as part of the
Department." The fact is that the
first document related to SLAC,
dated April 19, 1956 and signed
by Professors Bloch, Ginzton,
Hofstadter, Panofsky and Schiff,
who at that time were all
members of the Physics faculty,
states explicitly "a project of this
size cannot be handled within the
framework of the Physics
Department or of any existing
part of the University, and will
require that an independent
University activity be
established."
Although SLAC and the
Physics Department have been
separate since the beginning, it is
interesting to note that members

of the SLAC faculty supervise a
number of Physics graduate
students for Ph.D. work, and
teach occasional courses in the
Physics Department. Four
members of the Physics
Department faculty are engaged in
research at SLAC, and several
members of the two groups attend
and speak at each other's
seminars.
Arthur L. Schawlow, Chairman
Department of Physics
(Editor's reply: The DAILY regrets
the poor phrasing used when it was
said that the Physics Department
"vetoed" the nomination of SLAC
Director Wolfgang Panofsky for the
post of vice-president for research. The
meaning the sentence was intended to
convey was that there was heavy
opposition among many members of
the Physics faculty to appointing
Panofsky—strong enough so that many
physics professors ostensibly could not
work with Panofsky in that position.
At least this was the impression given
to the search committee. On top of
this, we have learned that Panofsky is
one of the top three choices—if not the
top pick—for Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, but will very likely not get
that job either, because of vehement
opposition from the Physics
Department.
If the Physics faculty would like to
keep their reasons a secret, then one
can only believe they are petty. And
one can only believe that the political
structure of this academic community
is warped if one department can exert
such disproportionate influence.)
Sapir Slashed
To the Editor:
I write this letter in reference

to Marc Sapir's guest column in
The Daily of July 23, 1969. Mr.
Sapir has demonstrated many
times in the past a proclivity for
exaggeration and unsubstantiated
accusation, but surely he has
outdone himself this time.
Specifically: In referring to the
men who will attend the
International Industrial
Conference sponsored by SRI, Mr.
Sapir stated: "And it was men like
them (in some cases the very same
men) who were the main political
and economic power base behind
Adolf Hitler."
Oh really now! This is no
longer a joke. If Mr. Sapir really
believes that some of these men
constituted the main political and
economic power base of Nazi
Germany, I think he owes it to us,
to the Stanford community, to
the United States, to the whole
world, to tell us to which of these
men he is referring, and exactly
why he things that his accusations
are true. Sure, Mr. Sapir, call them
vipers and imperialists all you like;
if they don't mind, I certainly
don't mind. But to call them
Nazis, that is a whole new ball
game. "
I consider Mr. Sapir's charges
to be of the utmost importance. I
would like to suggest that Mr.
Sapir support his claims that some
of the very same men who will
attend the lIC were the main
political and economic power base
behind Adolf Hitler; I want to
know which men, and I want to
know specifically what they did.
Alternatively, I feel that Mr. Sapir
should retract his statement and
apologize to the lIC, and to the
entire Stanford community.

The story in the Stanford Daily
of Wednesday, July 23 in regard
to the position of Vice President
for Research contains two
important errors of fact. First, the
Physics Department did not veto
the nomination of Professor
Panofsky for this position.
Indeed, the Department did not
meet on this matter and did not
act for or against any nominee. It
is my understanding that a
number of individual members of
various departments in the
Stanford Community were
consulted concerning the duties
associated with this position and
the qualifications of possible
nominees, and that they expressed
their personal opinions.
Second, the Daily story states
that "many Physics faculty
members opposed setting up
SLAC as a separate entity,
preferring to have it as part of the
Department." The fact is that the
first document related to SLAC,
dated April 19, 1956 and signed
by Professors Bloch, Ginzton,
Hofstadter, Panofsky and Schiff,
who at that time were all
members of the Physics faculty,
states explicitly "a project of this
size cannot be handled within the
framework of the Physics
Department or of any existing
part of the University, and will
require that an independent
University activity be
established."
Although SLAC and the
Physics Department have been
separate since the beginning, it is
interesting to note that members

of the SLAC faculty supervise a
number of Physics graduate
students for Ph.D. work, and
teach occasional courses in the
Physics Department. Four
members of the Physics
Department faculty are engaged in
research at SLAC, and several
members of the two groups attend
and speak at each other's
seminars.
Arthur L. Schawlow, Chairman
Department of Physics
(Editor's reply: The DAILY regrets
the poor phrasing used when it was
said that the Physics Department
"vetoed" the nomination of SLAC
Director Wolfgang Panofsky for the
post of vice-president for research. The
meaning the sentence was intended to
convey was that there was heavy
opposition among many members of
the Physics faculty to appointing
Panofsky—strong enough so that many
physics professors ostensibly could not
work with Panofsky in that position.
At least this was the impression given
to the search committee. On top of
this, we have learned that Panofsky is
one of the top three choices—if not the
top pick—for Dean of Humanities and
Sciences, but will very likely not get
that job either, because of vehement
opposition from the Physics
Department.
If the Physics faculty would like to
keep their reasons a secret, then one
can only believe they are petty. And
one can only believe that the political
structure of this academic community
is warped if one department can exert
such disproportionate influence.)
Sapir Slashed
To the Editor:
I write this letter in reference

to Marc Sapir's guest column in
The Daily of July 23, 1969. Mr.
Sapir has demonstrated many
times in the past a proclivity for
exaggeration and unsubstantiated
accusation, but surely he has
outdone himself this time.
Specifically: In referring to the
men who will attend the
International Industrial
Conference sponsored by SRI, Mr.
Sapir stated: "And it was men like
them (in some cases the very same
men) who were the main political
and economic power base behind
Adolf Hitler."
Oh really now! This is no
longer a joke. If Mr. Sapir really
believes that some of these men
constituted the main political and
economic power base of Nazi
Germany, I think he owes it to us,
to the Stanford community, to
the United States, to the whole
world, to tell us to which of these
men he is referring, and exactly
why he things that his accusations
are true. Sure, Mr. Sapir, call them
vipers and imperialists all you like;
if they don't mind, I certainly
don't mind. But to call them
Nazis, that is a whole new ball
game. "
I consider Mr. Sapir's charges
to be of the utmost importance. I
would like to suggest that Mr.
Sapir support his claims that some
of the very same men who will
attend the lIC were the main
political and economic power base
behind Adolf Hitler; I want to
know which men, and I want to
know specifically what they did.
Alternatively, I feel that Mr. Sapir
should retract his statement and
apologize to the lIC, and to the
entire Stanford community.
