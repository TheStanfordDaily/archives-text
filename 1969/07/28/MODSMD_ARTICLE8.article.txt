# Conspiracy Of One
## A
						Drunken Conversation 
### Dan Snell 
I got a call from the Drunk a
while ago.
I was just sitting in the office,
piddling around as usual, and the
Drunk called, and we started
talking. Mainly, we started
mumbling, since when the Drunk
calls he's usually too drunk to pay
much attention to what he's
saying. He just makes
conversational noises.
To begin with, I tried to make
a little coherent noise. I think he
was talking about the Manchester
Guardian or something. He
sounded as though he asked me a

question about it. And I said I
didn't know.
"Whaddaya mean ya dunno?
Huh" he asked.
"Well, I just don't know."
"Lizn, ya think yar putou
there, the New Yor Timz?"
"No, I don't think that, I just
think we have to approach the
problem sanely."
"Listen, I've ha abou enough o
that," he said. "I'm getting tire of
all this sort of stuff."
But then he began to attack me
personally for my being
implicated as part of the

newspaper world, He said that if
he had read the newspaper he
subscribed to today, he'd be able
to do a thing or two. But he said
he never got time, or perhaps he
said something very like that.
"Lizn, you publishing now?"
he queried.
"No, we publish Tuesdays and
Fridays," I said crisply.
"Well, why? I mean you're
spose to be a daily paper, an you
only jus publish Tuesday and,
an . . .
"Friday," I said crisply.
"Yah. An Friday . . .
"Well, I'm sorry about that,
but we tend to do our studying on
the other days."
"Ya ten ta do yer studin on the
ther days?" he said with great
malice, as if he were about to
pounce on me with some terribly
devasting rejoinder.
"Yes," I said.
"Yes," he said. And his
consciousness seemed to drift off
somewhere else. "Ya ever seen the
Mreml Shraffr?" he asked, or
something like that.
"No, what's it like?"
"Whaddaya mean, what's it
like," he said, hurt. "It's jus abou
thebes ol thing ever came out o
the whole worl."
"I've never seen it," I
confessed.
"Well, if you worked on the
Mreml Shraffr, that'd be
something else," he said. "You
know what they do?"
"No, what do they do?" 1
asked.
"Well, they jus abou do
ev'thing ya cou thinka, you
know,"he replied.
You can only go on like that so
long, not knowing what the
Mreml Shraffr is. So we said
farewell and hung up, but he said
he'd call back.
