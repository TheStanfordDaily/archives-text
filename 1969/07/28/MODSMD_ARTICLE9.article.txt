# Sounds Like Summer
## An Unclassical Guitar 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
When a performer slights his
audience, it may be because he
holds them in contempt, or that
he ignores them, or that he simply
doesn't know how to handle
them. A significant part of the
audience at Oscar Ghiglia's
Tuesday evening concert, myself
included, did feel slighted; I hope
it was because of Mr. Ghiglia's
lack of familiarity with live
performance.
He did not follow his program
clearly, nor were his departures
from it explained (such as the
playing of three pieces
consecutively); the concert was
rather abbreviated, with less than
an hour of actual music, and Mr.
Ghiglia observed the unfortunate
custom of so many performers, of
not announcing his encores.
Audiences should not be expected
to find the labyrinthian thread
unaided, nor to recognize
seldom-played pieces of obscure
composers for unfamiliar
instruments.
Mr. Ghiglia's faux pas would
have been less grating had his
performance lived up to
expectations. He is certainly not
"heir to Segovia," and it will be
years, 1 am afraid, before he
enters the class so long headed by
the Master. Classical guitar playing
is a combination of technical skill,
interpretation of the music, and
the esoteric quality of
understanding and one-ness with
the instrument. I feel that Julian
Bream, the English guitarist and
lutenist, best combines these
qualities; Mr. Ghiglia, however,
was lacking in each.
I will not criticize his
interpretations beyond pointing
out that they lacked any
excitement or progressive
development of themes. Still,
there cannot be any excuse for
such amateurish accidents as
buzzed strings or mis-struck notes,
especially when the flair of

light ening-fast runs and
modulations is avoided.
A first-rate performer is
assumed to be technically
proficient, and distinctions are
made only between fantastic and
super-fantastic when we compare
Rubinstein, Horowitz and Serkin.
But Mr. Ghiglia gave the
impression of not having done his
homework, and this is
inexcusable.
The guitar is limited in tone
color and range of volume, and
Mr. Ghiglia submitted to these
limitations rather than
overcoming them. A great
guitarist exploits what the
instrument does offer by
juxtaposing differences in pitch,
timbre and loudness.
Except for his surprisingly
good renditions of "Tarantella"
and "Mallorca," two extremely
challenging pieces, I was rather
bored with the concert. I had the
distinct impression that Mr.
Ghiglia just did not know how to
perform before an audience.

Andres Segovia is well-known
for making one Rameres sound
like a full chorus; Mr. Ghiglia,
unfortunately, played in a
monotone quite consistently. He i
lacked the intensity and force
which can make a guitar recital a
truly thrilling experience.
For our part, I should be fair
and point out that Summer
Festival audiences have often been
rude and unfair to the performers.
Arriving late, leaving before the
house lights are on, clapping ,
between movements, and filling
the stage after the performance
characterize unsophisticated and
inconsiderate audiences. We are :
guilty of these faults, and more.
The most conspicuous l
misdemeanor at these concerts has !
been the tendency tol
over-applaud (with the exception
of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band
shows, which require more
audience participation). Applause
provides release for the listener, i
tense with concentration on the
music, and thanks for the artist,
who then knows that his efforts
were appreciated.
But applause should be in
proportion to the quality of the
performance above all, and
Summer Festival audiences have
been beating their palms flat for
nearly anything. This was the case
at Mr. Ghiglia's concert; in spite
of a mediocre recital, he was
called back for two encores
(although just barely called back.)
Perhaps the audience was anxiousi
to get their money's worth, and in
this they cannot be blamed.
Classical guitar is beautiful, and
has been thought so for hundreds
of years. It should be experienced
by everyone who appreicates
classical music in general, or any
of the more modern styles of
guitar playing. I suggest you
purchase a recording of Andres
Segovia or Julian Bream
(classical), or Manitas de Plata or
Carlos Montoya (Flamenco and
Spanish). You will enjoy them for
years. i

lack of familiarity with live
performance.
He did not follow his program
clearly, nor were his departures
from it explained (such as the
playing of three pieces
consecutively); the concert was
rather abbreviated, with less than
an hour of actual music, and Mr.
Ghiglia observed the unfortunate
custom of so many performers, of
not announcing his encores.
Audiences should not be expected
to find the labyrinthian thread
unaided, nor to recognize
seldom-played pieces of obscure
composers for unfamiliar
instruments.
Mr. Ghiglia's faux pas would
have been less grating had his
performance lived up to
expectations. He is certainly not
"heir to Segovia," and it will be
years, 1 am afraid, before he
enters the class so long headed by
the Master. Classical guitar playing
is a combination of technical skill,
interpretation of the music, and
the esoteric quality of
understanding and one-ness with
the instrument. I feel that Julian
Bream, the English guitarist and
lutenist, best combines these
qualities; Mr. Ghiglia, however,
was lacking in each.
I will not criticize his
interpretations beyond pointing
out that they lacked any
excitement or progressive
development of themes. Still,
there cannot be any excuse for
such amateurish accidents as
buzzed strings or mis-struck notes,
especially when the flair of

light ening-fast runs and
modulations is avoided.
A first-rate performer is
assumed to be technically
proficient, and distinctions are
made only between fantastic and
super-fantastic when we compare
Rubinstein, Horowitz and Serkin.
But Mr. Ghiglia gave the
impression of not having done his
homework, and this is
inexcusable.
The guitar is limited in tone
color and range of volume, and
Mr. Ghiglia submitted to these
limitations rather than
overcoming them. A great
guitarist exploits what the
instrument does offer by
juxtaposing differences in pitch,
timbre and loudness.
Except for his surprisingly
good renditions of "Tarantella"
and "Mallorca," two extremely
challenging pieces, I was rather
bored with the concert. I had the
distinct impression that Mr.
Ghiglia just did not know how to
perform before an audience.

Andres Segovia is well-known
for making one Rameres sound
like a full chorus; Mr. Ghiglia,
unfortunately, played in a
monotone quite consistently. He i
lacked the intensity and force
which can make a guitar recital a
truly thrilling experience.
For our part, I should be fair
and point out that Summer
Festival audiences have often been
rude and unfair to the performers.
Arriving late, leaving before the
house lights are on, clapping ,
between movements, and filling
the stage after the performance
characterize unsophisticated and
inconsiderate audiences. We are :
guilty of these faults, and more.
The most conspicuous l
misdemeanor at these concerts has !
been the tendency tol
over-applaud (with the exception
of the Preservation Hall Jazz Band
shows, which require more
audience participation). Applause
provides release for the listener, i
tense with concentration on the
music, and thanks for the artist,
who then knows that his efforts
were appreciated.
But applause should be in
proportion to the quality of the
performance above all, and
Summer Festival audiences have
been beating their palms flat for
nearly anything. This was the case
at Mr. Ghiglia's concert; in spite
of a mediocre recital, he was
called back for two encores
(although just barely called back.)
Perhaps the audience was anxiousi
to get their money's worth, and in
this they cannot be blamed.
Classical guitar is beautiful, and
has been thought so for hundreds
of years. It should be experienced
by everyone who appreicates
classical music in general, or any
of the more modern styles of
guitar playing. I suggest you
purchase a recording of Andres
Segovia or Julian Bream
(classical), or Manitas de Plata or
Carlos Montoya (Flamenco and
Spanish). You will enjoy them for
years. i

When a performer slights his
audience, it may be because he
holds them in contempt, or that
he ignores them, or that he simply
doesn't know how to handle
them. A significant part of the

Tuesday evening concert, myself
included, did feel slighted; I hope
it was because of Mr. Ghiglia's
