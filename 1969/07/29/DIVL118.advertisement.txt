I LAFAYEm
Sure, there's lots of good stereo equipment on
: the market, and the other stores have some of it.
■M And most of it is priced so that they can offer
;*•••'"I the customer a tricky"discount" and still make a
■ full profit. (They have to, to stay in business, you
i'l know.) We have to do the same, with other brands
of equipment that are priced that way.
Our own Lafayette equipment (top-rated by
ffl BOTH independent consumer testing organiza
tions) is just a little different. It's a little better, for
fil one thing. (Let us show you those independent
'fifl reports.)
And it's honestly priced, to give you good value,
I but not fake discounts. Shop elsewhere. Then see
I what good systems you can get at Lafayette for
I the price you want to pay. Our VALUES are the
I best. That's why we think you'll shop Lafayette
I last!
