# Coyote Hill Plan Draws Opposition
## 
### BARBARA SIMON 
The changing face of Palo Alto will be the subject of
the open Planning Commission Meeting to be held this
Wednesday, July 30. Stanford confronts the commission
with two major changes, the financial center at Page Mill
and El Camino, and the new industrial complex on
Coyote Hill.
The controversial area of Coyote Hill, bounded by
Foothill Expressway, Page Mill Road, Junipero Serra
Freeway, Arastradero Road and Hillview Avenue, is
particularly disputed.
The Planning Commission meeting will take place at
7:30 at City Hall, Embarcadero and Newell.
As one of many concerned members of the
community, Mrs. Jill Sen, newsletter editor for the
Stanford Conservation Group, protested in a letter to The
Daily (July 23), "The Coyote Hill area, on the southwest
corner of Page Mill Road and Foothill Expressway, is in
immediate danger of being paved over... The
decision . . . affects the entire Stanford community ... it
should be carefully considered by the people affected, not
,ust a few in important positions, before a unique part of
our foothills is sacrificed to progress."
Supporting Statement
At the July 9 Planning Commission Meeting, also
:onsidering the disputed zoning and land use of Coyote
Hill, Mr. Boyd Smith, Stanford's manager of Real Estate,
jresented a statement strongly supporting the present
L-M:5, light industrial, zoning of the area.
Smith urged that L-M:5 zoning be upheld since
'substantial sums have been expended by the University
rnd fits potential tenents . . . for planning and design."
Smith also refers to the construction of two roads,
x?gun in April 1969, anticipating further industrial
levelopment. At the time of the original zoning in 1960 a

water line was placed by Palo Alto and University jov
agreement "along the alignment of what was then
recognized as the future road linking Arastradero to Page
Mill Expressway . . . Stanford [also] designed openings in
the median strip [of the Page Mill Expressway] to
conform to the intersection of future roads linking
Stanford lands to Page Mill Expressway."
These two roads were started without the Planning
Commission's knowledge or permission, according to
Stanford Conservation Group fact sheet. Construction was
approved only by the Planning Staff, appointed city
employees hired to insure construction complies with
existing ordinances set by the Planning Commission, the
elected representatives of the community.
Reported Month Later
The Planning Staff, though deciding in accordance with
the existing L-M:5 zoning is answerable to the Planning
Commission and did not report the new road construction
"until a month later," after construction had begun,
reports the Conservation Group memo.
The summary continues, "The Planning Staff also
approved a lot division of the 177 acres and didn't inform
the Commission. The City Manager was informed and
wrote a letter to the City Council saying that since the lot
division had been approved, Arastradero Road must be
widened. This was the first the Council or the Commission
had heard of the new building plans."
The original zoning, states the Conservation history,
occured in 1960. "There were plans for Ampex facilities,
including a park, and these plans looked good . . . The
Ampex proposal fell through and the land remained zoned
L-M:5."
"Two years ago [1967]," the history continues, "the
City Council asked the Palo Alto Planning Commission to
review the zoning on the 177 acre Coyote Hill area. The

Chairman of the Planning Commission was against any
zoning change, and appointed himself and two others to a
special committee to meet with Stanford on the question.
There was one meeting, about which one member of the
committee was never informed. The Chairman announced
to the Commission that meetings had been held and that
the L-M:5 zoning would remain."
University Plans
"Following this decision," states Smith's July 9 speech
referring to the 1967 hearing, "the University began
planning and road design for the L-M:5 area... the
University regularly consulted with the Palo Alto City
staff to make certain that the design and specifications
conformed to city requirements."
The Campus Report, July 23, featured an article on
construction plans for the Coyote Hill area development.
The zoning controversy was referred to briefly.
"One snag arose," the Campus Report notes, "when
the city attorney ruled that development plans for each
parcel had to be approved by both the commission and
the council, although those bodies had set the zoning
requirements. This new ruling calls for commission and
council approval if a property is divided into five or more
parcels."
The Coyote Hill area, according to Campus Report, is
now slated for division into fourteen parcels.
First Development in 1951
Development of Stanford land within the city of Palo
Alto was begun in 1951. Development was basically
necessary, not only to raise funds for the University but
also to pay the property tax due on all land not in the
Academic Reserve or used for educational purposes.
The land must be leased since Leland Stanford
prohibited sale of anv of the 88 hundred acres which
