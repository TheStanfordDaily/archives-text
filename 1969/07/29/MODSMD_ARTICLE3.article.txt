# Approval Granted For Rock Concert
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Last week, President Kenneth
Pitzer and his staff decided to give
"conditional approval" to the
August 17 rock concert planned
by SCORE, the on-campus
affiliate of the Midpeninsula Free
University.
Although the advice of the
policy subcommittee of the
Presidential Committee on Public
Exercises had been to reject the
application, within the President's
office an about-face occurred.
Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley influenced matters in the
direction of approval of the Free
U's concert. He told The Daily
later that the "best interests of
the University were served by
rejecting" the advice of the
Committee on Public Exercises in
this case.
Apparently Director of Public
Events Tom Bacchetti also called
for reconsideration of the
Committee's advice by the
President's Office.
Jim Schnieder, a member of
the policy subcommittee, told
The Daily that it had always been
his contention that decisions of
this nature should lie in Pitzer's
hands. He then offered an
evaluation of the present
situation: "It seems obvious to me
that the proceeds from this event
will benefit those who have cost
the University literally hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
"It seems inconsistent for the
University to further the ends of
such a group. Indeed, the
University should not allow this
group to continue under its
auspices.
"Unfortunately, there will
come a time when the University
can no longer remain neutral
when its own welfare is at stake.
In my opinion, that time has long
since past."

The conditions set down by
the Stanford administration place
considerable discretionary power
in Bacchetti's hands. He has the
authority to lower the noise level.
More importantly, he determines
whether there is a breach of any
of the conditions. If there is,
future similar events sponsored by
the same group would probably
not be allowed.
The University has asked that
the length of the concert be
limited to four and one-half
hours, that the audience be
limited to 5000, that no one
consume alcoholic beverages or
smoke marijuana. Stanford police
will direct traffic.
SCORE has agreed to accept all
personal injury liability for the
event and to pay for any property
damage and costs of cleaning up.
All receipts from the event are,
at the University's request, to be
deposited with the ASSU's
Student Organization Fund. To
withdraw money from this fund, a
purchase order must be approved
by the ASSU student financial
manager.
Concert producer Bob
Cullenbine of the Free U foresees
no problems here. He says an
analysis of past expenditures of
student organizations should show
that SCORE will be able to spend
this money in ways beneficial to
both the Free U and the Stanford
community.

considerable discretionary power
in Bacchetti's hands. He has the
authority to lower the noise level.
More importantly, he determines
whether there is a breach of any
of the conditions. If there is,
future similar events sponsored by
the same group would probably
not be allowed.
The University has asked that
the length of the concert be
limited to four and one-half
hours, that the audience be
limited to 5000, that no one
consume alcoholic beverages or
smoke marijuana. Stanford police
will direct traffic.
SCORE has agreed to accept all
personal injury liability for the
event and to pay for any property
damage and costs of cleaning up.
All receipts from the event are,
at the University's request, to be
deposited with the ASSU's
Student Organization Fund. To
withdraw money from this fund, a
purchase order must be approved
by the ASSU student financial
manager.
Concert producer Bob
Cullenbine of the Free U foresees
no problems here. He says an
analysis of past expenditures of
student organizations should show
that SCORE will be able to spend
this money in ways beneficial to
both the Free U and the Stanford
community.
Last week, President Kenneth
Pitzer and his staff decided to give
"conditional approval" to the
August 17 rock concert planned
by SCORE, the on-campus
affiliate of the Midpeninsula Free
University.
Although the advice of the
policy subcommittee of the
Presidential Committee on Public
Exercises had been to reject the
application, within the President's
office an about-face occurred.
Dean of Students Peter
Bulkeley influenced matters in the
direction of approval of the Free
U's concert. He told The Daily
later that the "best interests of
the University were served by
rejecting" the advice of the
Committee on Public Exercises in
this case.
Apparently Director of Public
Events Tom Bacchetti also called
for reconsideration of the
Committee's advice by the
President's Office.
Jim Schnieder, a member of
the policy subcommittee, told
The Daily that it had always been
his contention that decisions of
this nature should lie in Pitzer's
hands. He then offered an
evaluation of the present
situation: "It seems obvious to me
that the proceeds from this event
will benefit those who have cost
the University literally hundreds
of thousands of dollars.
"It seems inconsistent for the
University to further the ends of
such a group. Indeed, the
University should not allow this
group to continue under its
auspices.
"Unfortunately, there will
come a time when the University
can no longer remain neutral
when its own welfare is at stake.
In my opinion, that time has long
since past."

The conditions set down by
the Stanford administration place
considerable discretionary power
in Bacchetti's hands. He has the
authority to lower the noise level.

whether there is a breach of any
