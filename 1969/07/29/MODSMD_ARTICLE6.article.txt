An extension on the industrial park is planned for Coyote Hill. A
mammoth financial center is in the works for the corner of Page Mill
and El Camino. Luxury apartments have been built across Willow Road
from the Medical Center. The fate of the Corporation Yard, once slated
for low-cost housing, is uncertain.
It sounds like business is booming in Palo Alto. True- but
unfortunately all the pafcels of land mentioned arc owned by Stanford
University.
Stanford is a collection of varied natural resources—land, people,
buildings, books, equipment—which have been developed to create one
of the world's greatest educational institutions. This has been the focus
of all the talent and manpower that has been applied here. Stanford has
specialized in the past, and this obviously seems to be its future
direction. Its master craftsmen arc teachers and researchers, its
apprentices are students.
The business of Stanford is education—not land development. The
sole purpose for which land not used for educational needs should be
employed is to provide income which can be used to improve and
expand the educational facilities—after all, education is Stanford's
raison d'etre.
Supposedly, this is the logic behind the above mentioned moves,
planned by Stanford administrators, and which now are bearing fruit.
Unfortunately, those who are of primary importance in the
educational process—students and faculty—do not have the final say in
the matter. Supposedly, the income will benefit them. Supposedly. But
they have no control over how it is gained or allocated.
Consider those who do have the power, who do control what the
University does with its resources. The Trustees of Stanford are mainly
chieftans of the military-industrial complex. The industrial park
extension, the financial complex, and other such moves benefit them
and their fellows at least as much as they do die University. Is this what
the community wants? We were never asked.
It has long been obvious that Stanford is no longer truly a "private"
university. Without federal assistance, this institution could not exist.
Stanford is what Clark Kerr called a "federal-grant university." These
are the facts of life in higher education today.
Surviving on federal largesse may seem to be one thing, and using
one's resources to enrich the military-industrial complex may seem to
be quite another. But at present, both take place at Stanford. As long as
the academic community allows itself to be controlled by a power
elite—of which our Board of Trustees are first-class representatives—this
phenomenon will continue.
Stanford is an educational institution, but it is controlled by those
whose interests lie elsewhere. As long as this continues, this University's
resources will be employed for the benefit of America's power
structure, and not for the benefit of those who desire to participate in
the process of education.
