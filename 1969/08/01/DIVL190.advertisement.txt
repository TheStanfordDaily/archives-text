I am a twenty-two year old ex-Stanford grad
student who would like to meet a humane
young lady to pursue such worthwhile and
inexpensive activities as pizza-making,
frisbee-throwing, picnics, zoo-going, etc. If
these activities interest you, why not take
the risk and send your name, and/or tele
phone number, ID bracelet, or what have
you, to post office box -'us..', Stanford.
