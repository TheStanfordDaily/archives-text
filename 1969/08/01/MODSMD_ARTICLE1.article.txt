# SCORE, Stanford Clash Over Rules
## 
### BILL EVERS 
An article in Monday's Palo
Alto Times caused a flare-up in
the controversy over the rock
concert planned for August 1 7 by
the Stanford Committee on
Radical Education (SCORE), the
on-cam pus affiliate of the
Midpeninsula Free University.
The dispute arose because the
Stanford administration wants the
proceeds from the rock concert to
remain on campus and not go to
the Free U, SCORE wants to
spend its funds as it wishes.
The Palo Alto Times carried an
article by James McNabb
describing the financial troubles
of the Free U. At the end of the
article McNabb described
Stanford's approval of the rock
concert and said: "The MFU is
banking on at least $1000 net
proceeds."
The appearance of this article
prompted Tom Bacchetti,
Director of Public Events at
Stanford, to write Tim Coburn of
SCORE, "that should evidence

prove that net income from this
event is being filtered off-campus
to meet the Free U's financial
crisis, or (there are) any other
violations of the agreement
(between SCORE and the Office
of Public Events), this will be
deemed sufficient cause for
rejection of future requests for
facilities for similar type events."
The agreement, signed by five
SCORE members, says: "All
receipts from the event shall be
promptly deposited in the
Student Organization Fund to the
credit of the agency account of
SCORE . . .and disbursement .. .
shall be in accordance with the
rules of the Student Organization
Fund. It is theunderstandingofthe
Office of Public Events that all
receipts shall be used exclusively
for (lie activities of SCORE and
not for any other purposes or
organizations."
A I ter receiving Bacchetti's
letter, Coburn commented to The
Daily :
"We intend to use the proceeds
of this concert entirely for
SCORE, hut obviously SCORE
sponsors programs that are of
interest to a broad spectrum of
both the Stanford community and
the outside community, which
includes the MFU.
"For years the University has
tried to preserve the myth of our
"isolated farm" atmosphere at
Stanford, while in fact the Palo
Alto merchants are financially
dependent on money that "filters
off campus."
"Frankly, I do not see any
difference between this latter type
of support and the support of
merchants with a more sincere
interest in education, such as the
Free University Print Shop, which
is making our posters and ads (for
the rock concert)."
Bob Cullenbine, Free U
coordinator and the producer of
the up-coming rock concert told
The Daily last night that "student
organizations should be able to
spend their money any way they
like." He added that if Bacchetti
tried to regulate the spending of
student groups, Bacchetti would
find all the voluntary student

Bacchelti said to I he Daily
yesterday afternoon that the
student financial manager, not the

says SCORE signed the agreement
and should abide by its provisions,
which he interprets as forbidding
the transfer of SCORE funds to
the Free U.
Problems may arise when what

SCORE sees as its regular
activities involve payments to the
Free U. The ASSU by-laws on the
Students' Organizations Fund
(article V, section 3) and on
holding benefits (article I, section
3) do not exclude off-campus
expenditures by on-campus
student groups. The Policy
Manual of the Committee on

Stanford organizations, but does
not then limit how the
organization spends its money.
But the Stanford administration
does not want Stanford facilities
used for any benefit which will
subsidize the Free U.
An article in Monday's Palo
Alto Times caused a flare-up in
the controversy over the rock
concert planned for August 1 7 by
the Stanford Committee on
Radical Education (SCORE), the
on-cam pus affiliate of the
Midpeninsula Free University.
The dispute arose because the
Stanford administration wants the
proceeds from the rock concert to
remain on campus and not go to
the Free U, SCORE wants to
spend its funds as it wishes.
The Palo Alto Times carried an
article by James McNabb
describing the financial troubles
of the Free U. At the end of the
article McNabb described
Stanford's approval of the rock
concert and said: "The MFU is
banking on at least $1000 net
proceeds."
The appearance of this article
prompted Tom Bacchetti,
Director of Public Events at
Stanford, to write Tim Coburn of
SCORE, "that should evidence

prove that net income from this
event is being filtered off-campus
to meet the Free U's financial
crisis, or (there are) any other
violations of the agreement
(between SCORE and the Office
of Public Events), this will be
deemed sufficient cause for
rejection of future requests for
facilities for similar type events."
The agreement, signed by five
SCORE members, says: "All
