# Film Notes
## International Animated Films Here 
### TODD FLINCHBAUGH 
It is the rare artist who can say something
socially relevant and be entertaining at the same
time. Many of the film artists represented in the
First International Tournee of Animation
demonstrate this ability. The Tournee, a touring
collection of 20 short animated films from 12
countries, are being presented by the Stanford
Department of Communication. There will be two
showings tonight at 7:30 and 10 p.m. in Cubberley
Auditorium. The films were shown once last night.
The films were selected for tour by a non-profit,
cooperative organization of film artists. A wide
variety of animation techniques are demonstrated,
including pixillation, painting on film as well as
conventional cell animation. The styles reflect the
innovative influence of the fine arts on the new
school of creative animation artists. The film
content deals successfully with social satire while
maintaining a refreshing sense of humor.
Crunch, Crunch, by Carlos Marchiori of Canada,
is one of the most successful combinations of the
stylistic and satirical potentials of animation.
Silhouetted figures move in front of vividly colored
jungle backgrounds. Animal eats animal. Man
conquers animal. Man conquers man. Finally, a hero
emerges. Recognition of the great conqueror is
insured and he seems destined to be revered by
posterity. Then, along comes a little dog to put
things into proper perspective.
Some of the shorter films are television
commercials and succeed admirably in breaking up

the tension surrounding a more dramatic work.
Other short films, like The Duel by Ronald Bijlma
of Holland and Aru Taku Na Baai by Sadao
Tsukioka of Japan, are less than four minutes long
but still tell interesting little fables. Two Polish
films, Reign of IN umbers by Stefan Schabenbeck
and Cages by Miroslaw Kijowiev, present stark
ominous environments as the comment on some
aspects of the human situation.
The masterpiece is Boris Kolar's Serendipity,
(subtitled Discover), from Zagreb filmsofYugoslavia.lt
deals with a man who ventures into his environment
often finding things he didn't quite predict.
Serendipity, is especially apropos in the wake of the
recent hijinks into space. The film is flawed by its
length, but the final sequence is as classic a piece of
black humor as Dr. Strangelove. A man stands on a
rocky horizon and attempts to make the sun come
up in response to the sound of his trumpet. The
horn calls forth responses but not the ones
intended.
Notes on a Triangle from Rene Jodoin of
Canada, and Resultat by Ante Zaninovic of
Yugoslavia are also unique visual experiences.
However, it is foolish to single out specific films
from such an exceptional collection of animation
carefully selected from festivals throughout the
world.
The Tournee is an annual collection and the
Department of Communication will present the
Second Tournee of Animation in October of 1969.


ANIMATIONâ€”If you play with fire, you may get burned. Bui the man in the
animated film, "Serendipity" (subtitled "Discover") by Boris Kolar of Yugoslavia,
doesn't seem to realize Ibis-yet. This is one of 20 films being presented as part of
the First International Tournee of Animation. Two shows will be given tonight in
Cubberley Auditorium.
