• Moon Research
Stanford University researchers
will participate in a key phase of
lunar soil analysis work assigned
to NASA's Ames Research Center
in Mountain View, California.
Stanford scientists Dr.
Berthold Halpern, of the
Department of Genetics, and Dr.
Gordon Hodgson, geochemist at
both Stanford University Medical
Center and Ames, will test their
portion of the hard-won samples
of the moon's soil for the
presence of porphyrin, the
pigment which in animal life
allows hemoglobin to capture and
carry oxygen, and in plant life
allows chlorophyll to capture light
energy for the synthesis of sugars.
They will carry out this work
in the specially equipped Lunar
Laboratory at Ames as part of a
consortium of sixteen scientists
headed by Ames cxobiologist Dr.
Cyril Ponnamperuma.
If porphyrin compounds are
found, they will have to be
investigated further to determine
the nature of their origin.
"While porphyrin compounds
are a basis of life, not all
por phyrins are b iogenically
formed," explained Dr. Hodgson.
"They are composed of carbon,
hydrogen and nitrogen, very
abundant and übiquitous
elements.
"We think porphyrins can form
as a result of energy shots in the
atmospheres of carbon stars, and
we have shown that they can arise
under certain heat and lighting
conditions on primitive planets."
• More Chicanos
Last year, there were 57
Chicanos (Mexican-Americans)
among Stanford University's
11,400 students.
This fall there will be nearly
200 as the result of an intensive
five-state recruitment program,
Luis Nogales, assistant to
President Kenneth S. Pitzer,
announced today. All meet the
University's admission
requirements.
The 1969-70 Chicano student
population will include 75

freshmen, about 20 transfer
students, and 30-40 graduate
students. The remainder will be
returning students.
"The need is not only to
produce more Chicanos with
college degrees, but with a college
education of first quality, so they
may assume leadership roles in
their own communities and in
society at large," said Nogales.
He pointed out that while
Chicanos comprise 12 percent of
the California population and 17
percent of the school age
population, they include less than
two percent of the four-year
college students in this state.
In the recruiting drive, Nogales
was aided by 15 Chicano students,
who visited high schools in
California, Arizona, New Mexico,
Colorado, and Texas.
"The admissions office doesn't
lower its standards in dealing with
minority groups," said Nogales.
"Other factors are injected to help
measure achievement and
potential more accurately.
At Stanford, the Chicano
student organization, formerly
called Mexican-American Student
Confederation, has changed its
name to Movimiento Estudiantil
Chicano de Aztlan (MECHA).
Aztlan was the Aztec name for
the Southwestern portion of the
U.S.
In addition to recruiting,
MECHA is working closely with
University faculty and
administrators on a proposal for a
Center for Chicano Studies. By
integrating Chicano heritage into
an academic atmosphere, the
Center, open to all Stanford
students, will help Chicanos study
their own culture.
• Environment Crisis
"De-development of
over-developed countries and
semi-development of
underdeveloped countries" were
demanded by a well-known
Stanford population biologist here
Wednesday night at a seminar of
the Business School's Executive
Program.
These actions, plus putting a
stop to population growth, are the

three steps governments should
take at once to combat the
impending crises of famine and
environmental pollution due to
overtake the overpopulated world,
Prof. Paul Ehrlich told his
audience of business executives
attending summer school.
"In a country like the
(over-developed) U.S. we must
stop this nonsense of perpetual
growth and waste and face the
fact that our days of looting and
polluting must come to an end,"
he said. "We must adjust our
society to fewer, smaller cars,
lifetime refrigerators without
built-in obsolescence,
non-disposable almost everything,
recycling of waste waters, and so
forth.
"Similar moves would be
required in all over-developed
countries," he added. "As many
people have pointed out, if the
U.S., the USSR and their friends
don't stop mucking around with
military adventures and get on
with saving the world, all of
humanity will go under."
• Medical Education
Stanford University School of
Medicine is one of five medical
schools which will collaborate on
a new program aimed at
improving the methods and
content of graduate and
continuing education of
physicians, and strengthening ties
between medical schools and
communities.

The program will be supported
by a two-year $548,000 grant
from the Commonwealth Fund,
and Carnegie Foundation of New
York to be shared by the five
medical schools—Stanford, Duke,
Case, Western Reserve, Johns
Hopkins, and McGill.
Each of the schools will
experiment with new methods of
specialty training, development of
closer relationships between
physicians in practice and medical
schools, and programs of
continuing education for
practicing physicians through
their professional careers.
