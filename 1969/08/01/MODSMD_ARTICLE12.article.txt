## The 						Credible Kaliedescope 
### DAVE STEVENS 
The first weekly shove-it award is hereby presented to Atco records
for announcing July 21 as the release date of the first Blind Faith
record and keeping me in a numbled state of expectancy all last week
while the release date came and went, hoping to get a quick review into
last week's Daily. According to a record store clerk I spoke to, this is a
common tactic for an important release: a big saturation advertising
campaign followed by a delay in bringing forth the product. The idea is
to cause people to ask for it at record stores, which causes the record
stores to file bigger orders with the distributors, which in turn means
bigger sales, a higher GNP, and a man on the moon. It all happened last
week, right?
But I don't mean to imply by talking about my "expectancy" that I
have high hopes for Blind Faith—the new super group which features
Eric Clapton and Ginger Baker from Cream and Stevie Winwood from
Traffic. The single has been out for a week or two now. I've heard it six
or seven times on KSAN, and the best I can say for it is that it's
unmemorable— i.e., I don't remember it. I love Clapton and I love Steve
Winwood, but somehow these forced marriages among the big rock
stars remind me of all the petty quarrels the gods used to get into up at
Olympus.
And the Cream's "Goodbye" album, one of the most remarkable
pieces of drudgery ever released by three highly competent musicians, is
a perfect example of what can happen to a rock group when there is no
respect or friendship left between the members of a band. Rock has
traditionally been a music of stars; at least until the San Francisco scene
started opening up, you didn't separate the music from the personality
behind it. Imagine the Big Bopper singing "Chantilly Lace" simply as
the anonymous vocalist for a name band!
That star syndrome has always been one of the fundamental
temperamental and musical differences between rock and jazz. And
now that the new rock has been with us a few years, and the technical
ability of rock musicians has risen almost as high as their egos, many
bands have had to face a serious crisis—whether to keep the personal
stamp of one performer on the music, or like jazz, to seek a
constructive and creative interplay.
Different groups have dealt with the problem in different ways:
Hendrix by finding two excellent sidemen who were willing to do
Hendrix's thing, John Mayall by putting his band on straight salary and
by going through a lot of personal changes; and, on the opposite ends
of the scale, there's the new collaboration of Crosby, Stills, and Nash
now with Neil Young besides which has so far worked out beautifully.
Cream, of course, did not solve the problem at all, and with two-thirds
of Cream making up half of Blind Faith, I can't help but wonder.
But strangely enough there's one group that has been around about
as long as the whole San Francisco scene has been around, has dealt
with the ego problem in the manner of jazz musicians, by forging a
creative group identity, and has made three excellent albums. The band
is Kaleidoscope, out of Los Angeles, a group which as one magazine put
it, "has never been hastily ushered from hysterical mobs."
In fact, Kaleidoscope has never received much acclaim at all, except
from the critics—the best review ever given a rock group by the jazz
Bible, Downbeat was in an article on Kaleidoscope about a year ago. If
you haven't ever got into the Kaleidoscope, pick up their most recent
album, "The Incredible Kaleidoscope" on Epic, a good example of their
work and of their worth.
"Kaleidoscope" is something of an appropriate name for the group,
whose five members play by my count from the record jackets,
twenty-eight instruments, and whose styles include Turkish, Louisiana
Cajun, hillbilly, blues, traditional folk and country and western.
Underpinning practically everything they do is an exotic Orientalism,
the contribution of band member Solomon Feldthouse from Turkey,
who plays guitar, clarinet, banjo, fiddle, twelve-string, dulcimer, and a
whole grab-bag of things I can't pronounce, like saz bouzoukee, vina,
caz, oud, and who besides that does most of the lead singing.
On the most recent album, they do a fine version of Howlin Wolf's
"Killing Floor" with new lyrics ("Tempe, Arizona"); a piece of what I
assume is Cajun-derived music, "Petite Fleur"; the old folk song
"Cukoo" in a solid, rocking version and a short instrumental featuring
David Lindley on banjo. Lindley usually handles lead guitar for the
group and plays with a refreshing sense of finesse and taste—no volume
trip, no scrambled brains for breakfast.
The best track on the album, and in many ways, the best thing the
Kaleidoscope has ever done, is the long instrumental "Seven-ate Sweet"
which gives a good indication of just how good the instrumentalists
really are. It's done, as the title suggests, in the strange meter of 7/8,
and weaves and builds nicely, like good jazz without a single funk
cliche. It starts with some interesting violin interplay between Lindley
and a third member of the group, Templeton Parcely, sensitive, never
ponderous, drumming by Paul Lagos, and eventually builds into, of all
things, one of those happy-yippee Greek tavern dances, a la Zorba the
Greek. It's all solidly professional, and, in a word, incredible.
