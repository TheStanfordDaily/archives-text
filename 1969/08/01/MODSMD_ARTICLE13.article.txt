# Sounds Like Summer
## Baroque With A Beat 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Baroque with a beat comes to the Peninsula this
weekend, as the New York. Rock and Roll Ensemble
makes its Northern California debut. Tonight at
8:30 in the San Jose Civic Auditorium, the
Ensemble plays Bach, Handel, Kabalevsky and
Lennon/McCartney with the San Francisco Pops,
under the experienced baton of Boston's Arthur
Fiedler. Then Sunday at 8 p.m. in Mem Aud, the
Ensemble performs Bach with their mentors, the
New York Chamber Soloists.
Purists may grimace at the thought of shaggy
guitar players strumming Bach sonatas, but an effort
to join classical and rock music creatively is long
overdue. The Ensemble is doing a fine job of filling
the void, in much the same way that Blood, Sweat
and Tears closes the hiatus between rock and jazz.
Three of the Ensemble's members—Martin
Fulterman, Michael Kamen, and Dorian
Rudnytsky—trained at Julliard, one of the most
prestigious schools of music in the world (and where
members of the Chamber Soloists have been
instructors).
Brian Corrigan and Cliff Nivison, the other two
members of the Ensemble, learned music the same
way Lightnin' Hopkins and Eric Clapton and Pete
Seegar did—on their own. But putting these sounds
together took a lot of imagination and hard work.
Quality in music is not measured in decibels, in spite
of what Bill Graham's banker says. When the Rock
and Roll Ensemble plays rock, it is clean, not
garbage; and their versions of Baroque are creative
and accurate.

That rock and baroque should go together so
well should not be surprising. Stones music is
basically Bach with the beats on two and four
instead of one and three. The I-IV-V-I, I-M-IV-V-I
andl-VI-IV-V-Iprogressions which for the basis of
folk, blues and rock have been in use since the
Renaissance, and were consistently employed by
Baroque composers. Syncopation, which we think
of as starting with Tommy Dorsey, and experiments
in time changes, which we think began with Dave
Brubeck, are actually present in many pieces by
Bach and Mozart.
Rock and roll owes an incredible amount to
Baroque and Classical inventions; the New York
Rock and Roll Ensemble begins by admitting the
debt and then extracting even more facinating music
by the union of the old and the new-built-on-old.
The Ensemble has an LP on ATCO, with a
second planned. In the meantime, they have put out
a single of "The Brandenberg," which illustrates
beautifully how happily seemingly dissimilar
partners can be webbed. Beginning with
harpsichord, cello and a pair of oboes, the Ensemble
progresses through Bach's inventions as competently
as any chamber orchestra, gradually modulating
through instrument changes to guitars, Fender bass,
organ and trap set accompanying a surprisingly rock
number. Old Johann really can swing.
Bach is on the charts, and the Rock and Roll
Ensemble is in San Jose tonight, in Mem Aud
Sunday, in Oakland August 7, and back in Mem
Aud August 9. Call now for tickets.

in time changes, which we think began with Dave
Brubeck, are actually present in many pieces by
Bach and Mozart.
Rock and roll owes an incredible amount to
Baroque and Classical inventions; the New York
Rock and Roll Ensemble begins by admitting the
debt and then extracting even more facinating music
by the union of the old and the new-built-on-old.
The Ensemble has an LP on ATCO, with a
second planned. In the meantime, they have put out
a single of "The Brandenberg," which illustrates
beautifully how happily seemingly dissimilar
partners can be webbed. Beginning with
harpsichord, cello and a pair of oboes, the Ensemble
progresses through Bach's inventions as competently
as any chamber orchestra, gradually modulating
through instrument changes to guitars, Fender bass,
organ and trap set accompanying a surprisingly rock
number. Old Johann really can swing.
Bach is on the charts, and the Rock and Roll
Ensemble is in San Jose tonight, in Mem Aud
Sunday, in Oakland August 7, and back in Mem
Aud August 9. Call now for tickets.
Baroque with a beat comes to the Peninsula this
weekend, as the New York. Rock and Roll Ensemble
makes its Northern California debut. Tonight at
8:30 in the San Jose Civic Auditorium, the
Ensemble plays Bach, Handel, Kabalevsky and
Lennon/McCartney with the San Francisco Pops,
under the experienced baton of Boston's Arthur
Fiedler. Then Sunday at 8 p.m. in Mem Aud, the
Ensemble performs Bach with their mentors, the
New York Chamber Soloists.
Purists may grimace at the thought of shaggy
guitar players strumming Bach sonatas, but an effort
to join classical and rock music creatively is long
overdue. The Ensemble is doing a fine job of filling
the void, in much the same way that Blood, Sweat
and Tears closes the hiatus between rock and jazz.
Three of the Ensemble's members—Martin
Fulterman, Michael Kamen, and Dorian
Rudnytsky—trained at Julliard, one of the most
prestigious schools of music in the world (and where
members of the Chamber Soloists have been
instructors).
Brian Corrigan and Cliff Nivison, the other two
members of the Ensemble, learned music the same
way Lightnin' Hopkins and Eric Clapton and Pete
Seegar did—on their own. But putting these sounds
together took a lot of imagination and hard work.
Quality in music is not measured in decibels, in spite
of what Bill Graham's banker says. When the Rock
and Roll Ensemble plays rock, it is clean, not
garbage; and their versions of Baroque are creative
and accurate.

That rock and baroque should go together so
well should not be surprising. Stones music is
basically Bach with the beats on two and four
instead of one and three. The I-IV-V-I, I-M-IV-V-I
andl-VI-IV-V-Iprogressions which for the basis of
folk, blues and rock have been in use since the
Renaissance, and were consistently employed by
Baroque composers. Syncopation, which we think
of as starting with Tommy Dorsey, and experiments
in time changes, which we think began with Dave
Brubeck, are actually present in many pieces by
Bach and Mozart.
