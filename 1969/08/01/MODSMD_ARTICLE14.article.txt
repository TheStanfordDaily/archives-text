## The 						Persecution Of 'Our Town' 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
"The Persecution, Assassination, and reserrection of Thornton
Wilder's Our Town as Performed by the Inmates of the Stanford
Far-Out Theater under the Direction of Almost Everybody," is the
Speech and Drama Department's offering for the summer quarter.
Actually, the title is a misnomer; The play is not directed by almost
everybody, it is directed by Chris Hampton, and it is acted by students
in the Contemporary Theater Workshop. Let's not blame almost
everybody for what one man has wrought.
Mr. Hampton has given us a rather bold rendition of Thornton
Wilder's play about small-town America. This is "Our Town" done up
in the trappings of environmental theater: slide projections, ensemble
"production numbers," black light sets, and references to the world of
1969 interpolated into Wilder's world of 1903. It is a very interesting
idea, but it doesn't work. Not at all.
"Our Town's" biggest problem is that it is misconceived: Mr.
Hampton was obviously trying to use it as a vehicle for attacking the
Establishment; but "Our Town" has nothing to do with what Mr.
Hampton apparently has on his mind. Thornton Wilder was telling
us —in a very sophisticated way —about life and death, love and sorrow
in a small New Hampshire town early in this century. You have to work
very hard to read power politics, class struggle, the generation gap, the
alienation of youth, and even Berkeley and Chicago, into the story of
how George loved Emily. And Mr. Hampton does just that; i.e. he
works very hard.
Mr. Hampton expresses himself with a subtlety and quality of
understatement that one usually associates with a Sherman tank. He is
not content to hint at what he wants us to understand that he is trying
to tell us; he must hit us and hit us with visual and audible billy clubs
and cliches. I wouldn't mind if I could be sure that this was all a big
put-on, but I am afraid that Mr. Hampton is serious.
A clever but annoying trick is Mr. Hampton's distortion of Wilder's
most innocent lines into diabolical schemes. Remember the Stage
Manager, that wise old fellow with the pipe who watches over the town,
plays minor roles, and acts as a narrator and genial host? Well, he has
now become Mr. Hampton's embodiment of the Establishment, the
Military-Industrial Complex personified. He manhandles and
minipulates the cast, slithering around the stage like a refugee from
from Faust. This is fine, except that it really has nothing to do with
"Our Town," or with anything else. In Act 3 it is the Stage Manager
who forces Emily's family to be indifferent to one another; Mr. Wilder
was telling us something much more important, much more subtle:
That it is part of the human condition to miss much of life,an allegedly
repressive social system is not necessary. Mr. Hampton cheapens this
message with his heavy political interpretation of the play. J.L.
Woolman does a fine enough job in acting the part; it is Mr. Hampton's
directing which is at fault.
Also, I must protest the way Mr. Hampton has handled the scenes
between George and Emily. Duane Tucker plays George like an Actor's
Studio reject, and Joan Riley's Emily while occassionally moving, often
hasa certain tree-like quality. This is really annoying! I can't tell how
much of it was due to the actors and how much to the director, but
clearly Mr. Hampton must take the responsibility for the fact that their
scenes - including nearly half of the second act —were completely
inaudible. Now, The Nitery isn't big enough to have acoustic
problems—you have to try very hard not to be heard. There is just no
excuse, artistic or otherwise, for making an audience strain to hear
anything in The Nitery, let alone half of an entire act.
The play is not a total loss; not many plays are. For instance, some
of it is very funny. Parts of the second act (Mr. Wilder tells us that the
second act is about "Love and Marriage") are played very broadly, and,
if not in the best taste, are at least moderately good burlesque. Judy
Freeman is a girl with a real sense of comedy, and she plays Mrs. Webb
beautifully, letting us laugh with her, rather than at her. She is the only
cast member who impressed me as consistently being above the disaster
that surrounded us all.
I am sorry that "Our Town" is not better than it is, but the plain
truth is that it is not very good. The fact that it was tried at all is a very
healthy sign, for a university theater should be adventurous;
unfortunately, "the persecution" of a fine play like "Our Town" isn't
much of an adventure.

of it is very funny. Parts of the second act (Mr. Wilder tells us that the
second act is about "Love and Marriage") are played very broadly, and,
if not in the best taste, are at least moderately good burlesque. Judy
Freeman is a girl with a real sense of comedy, and she plays Mrs. Webb
beautifully, letting us laugh with her, rather than at her. She is the only
cast member who impressed me as consistently being above the disaster
that surrounded us all.
I am sorry that "Our Town" is not better than it is, but the plain
truth is that it is not very good. The fact that it was tried at all is a very
healthy sign, for a university theater should be adventurous;
unfortunately, "the persecution" of a fine play like "Our Town" isn't
much of an adventure.


OIJR TOWN—Joan Riley and Duane Tucker groove as the small town sweethearts
Kmily and George in the Speech and Drama production of Thornton Wilder's
"Our Town," playing at The Nitery, various nights through August 9.
"The Persecution, Assassination, and reserrection of Thornton
Wilder's Our Town as Performed by the Inmates of the Stanford
Far-Out Theater under the Direction of Almost Everybody," is the
Speech and Drama Department's offering for the summer quarter.
Actually, the title is a misnomer; The play is not directed by almost
everybody, it is directed by Chris Hampton, and it is acted by students
in the Contemporary Theater Workshop. Let's not blame almost
everybody for what one man has wrought.
Mr. Hampton has given us a rather bold rendition of Thornton
Wilder's play about small-town America. This is "Our Town" done up
in the trappings of environmental theater: slide projections, ensemble
"production numbers," black light sets, and references to the world of
1969 interpolated into Wilder's world of 1903. It is a very interesting
idea, but it doesn't work. Not at all.
"Our Town's" biggest problem is that it is misconceived: Mr.
Hampton was obviously trying to use it as a vehicle for attacking the
Establishment; but "Our Town" has nothing to do with what Mr.
Hampton apparently has on his mind. Thornton Wilder was telling
us —in a very sophisticated way —about life and death, love and sorrow
in a small New Hampshire town early in this century. You have to work
very hard to read power politics, class struggle, the generation gap, the
alienation of youth, and even Berkeley and Chicago, into the story of
how George loved Emily. And Mr. Hampton does just that; i.e. he
works very hard.
Mr. Hampton expresses himself with a subtlety and quality of
understatement that one usually associates with a Sherman tank. He is
not content to hint at what he wants us to understand that he is trying
to tell us; he must hit us and hit us with visual and audible billy clubs
and cliches. I wouldn't mind if I could be sure that this was all a big
put-on, but I am afraid that Mr. Hampton is serious.
A clever but annoying trick is Mr. Hampton's distortion of Wilder's
most innocent lines into diabolical schemes. Remember the Stage
Manager, that wise old fellow with the pipe who watches over the town,
plays minor roles, and acts as a narrator and genial host? Well, he has
now become Mr. Hampton's embodiment of the Establishment, the
Military-Industrial Complex personified. He manhandles and
minipulates the cast, slithering around the stage like a refugee from
from Faust. This is fine, except that it really has nothing to do with
"Our Town," or with anything else. In Act 3 it is the Stage Manager
who forces Emily's family to be indifferent to one another; Mr. Wilder
was telling us something much more important, much more subtle:
That it is part of the human condition to miss much of life,an allegedly
repressive social system is not necessary. Mr. Hampton cheapens this
message with his heavy political interpretation of the play. J.L.
Woolman does a fine enough job in acting the part; it is Mr. Hampton's
directing which is at fault.
Also, I must protest the way Mr. Hampton has handled the scenes
between George and Emily. Duane Tucker plays George like an Actor's
Studio reject, and Joan Riley's Emily while occassionally moving, often
hasa certain tree-like quality. This is really annoying! I can't tell how
much of it was due to the actors and how much to the director, but
clearly Mr. Hampton must take the responsibility for the fact that their
scenes - including nearly half of the second act —were completely
inaudible. Now, The Nitery isn't big enough to have acoustic
problems—you have to try very hard not to be heard. There is just no
excuse, artistic or otherwise, for making an audience strain to hear
anything in The Nitery, let alone half of an entire act.

repressive social system is not necessary. Mr. Hampton cheapens this
message with his heavy political interpretation of the play. J.L.
Woolman does a fine enough job in acting the part; it is Mr. Hampton's
directing which is at fault.
Also, I must protest the way Mr. Hampton has handled the scenes
between George and Emily. Duane Tucker plays George like an Actor's
Studio reject, and Joan Riley's Emily while occassionally moving, often
hasa certain tree-like quality. This is really annoying! I can't tell how
much of it was due to the actors and how much to the director, but
clearly Mr. Hampton must take the responsibility for the fact that their
scenes - including nearly half of the second act —were completely
inaudible. Now, The Nitery isn't big enough to have acoustic
problems—you have to try very hard not to be heard. There is just no
excuse, artistic or otherwise, for making an audience strain to hear
anything in The Nitery, let alone half of an entire act.
The play is not a total loss; not many plays are. For instance, some
of it is very funny. Parts of the second act (Mr. Wilder tells us that the
second act is about "Love and Marriage") are played very broadly, and,
if not in the best taste, are at least moderately good burlesque. Judy
Freeman is a girl with a real sense of comedy, and she plays Mrs. Webb
beautifully, letting us laugh with her, rather than at her. She is the only
cast member who impressed me as consistently being above the disaster
that surrounded us all.
I am sorry that "Our Town" is not better than it is, but the plain
truth is that it is not very good. The fact that it was tried at all is a very
healthy sign, for a university theater should be adventurous;
unfortunately, "the persecution" of a fine play like "Our Town" isn't
much of an adventure.
