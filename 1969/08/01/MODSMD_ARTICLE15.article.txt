# Drama Review
## A 						Moving 'Concept' 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
"The Concept" is easily the most valid dramatic presentation to be
offered by the Summer Festival this year. In fact, I will go farther than
that: It is undoubtedly the best play seen at this year's Festival, and
possibly the best drama to be seen at Stanford in the last few years.
It is quite ironic that with all the high-powered talent assembled by
Baffrey and staff, the Festival has been "stolen" by a bunch of
reformed drug addicts who I really don't think could convince a
junior-high school drama class that they are actors. When they are
playing rich men touring a slum they are engagingly inept, shifting their
weight rythmically from foot to foot during long speeches, waving their
arms like high school actors playing "Julius Caesar." But when they
stop "acting" and settle down into their more familiar roles of being
themselves, the residents of Daytop Village, a halfway house for
narcotic addicts, then the stage reaches across the floor of the Tent
Theater, and everyone of us is sucked into their world where human
wrecks are salvaged and reassembled into men.
It is incredible—at least I find it incredible—that amateurs can
provide us with more meaningful theater than those professional groups
in the Bay Area with the alphabet soup names. The cast of "The
Concept" are reformed drug addicts, as are the writers. And yet, their
lack of professionalism, their inexperience, their crude, rough-cast way
of delivering lines, matter less and less until finally you don't give a
damn—you are with them 100 per cent, you're in Daytop, and you're
watching the beautiful and exciting rebirth of a person, all the more
moving because of its truth—it really did happen, to everyone of those
people on the stage.
If I seem to be overly impressed by the fact that real former addicts,
instead of real actors, just performed a play for me, I can only offer as
an explanation that, more than an hour after leaving the theater, my
insides were still in knots, and that doesn't happen very often. Daytop
Village uses encounter groups as part of its therapy, and while none of
the cast has had professional training in acting, they have all had several
years practice in communicating emotion, and, oh my, they do it too
well.
If you want to know what "The Concept" is about, well, it's about
life in Daytop Village. The play itself grew out of the therapy sessions
in Daytop; there's no real plot, there's no set, there's no music, no
costumes. Just people, human beings, who have personally lived
through hell, and have come here to tell us, not about hell, but about
how they travelled the road out.
When you go to see "The Concept," get to the theater early, as there
is no reserved seating; the doors open half an hour before curtain, and
this play is certainly worth a half-hour wait. It will run through Sunday
night.
