# Dean Napier's Specialty
## 'Personalized' Weddings 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
The marriage setting was an
jopen field of red poppies
j over-looking the Pacific.
The "altar" was made of wild
j flowers.
Since the two individuals about
! to be married, furthermore were
I living in an era that often has
j chosen to break with tradition,

they were encouraged to write
their own vows.
And with the help of
officiating minister, Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier, who
states "I don't think any two of
my services have been identical;"
the couple had their own
"personalized wedding."
Napier is quite enthusiastic
about such "do our own thing"
wedding ceremonies and believes
that "a couple shouldn't be forced
into anything just because it's
traditional.
"And I think the people who
attend the ceremony should be
involved in it,"he continued.
Napier, who has specialized in
"personalized weddings" since his
arrival at Stanford in 1966, is
open to any ideas that a couple
may have for designing their own
ceremony, but he admits that "I
won't administer any ceremony
that seems to me to be in bad
taste or doesn't seem right to
me."

When asked if he would
perform a marriage with either
participants or guests in the nude,
however, Napier smiled and said,
"the proposal has never come up;
but I'd have to think about it
first."
The Dean similarly invites
couples to "resist anything" that
gives them the slightest mental
reservation in his standard
ceremony, and encourages them
to write their own vows.
"I try not to offend any sect or
individual," Napier pointed out.
"I try to perform services that
appeal to all who attend."
He has often agreed to "cross
traditions," such as including a
Hebrew wine ceremony within a
partially Protestant ceremony for
the marriage of individuals with
different religious faiths.
In spite of his enthusiasm for
personalized weddings, however,
Napier states that he "detests"
large, elaborate ceremonies. "I've
seen many fine people literally
break under the strain and
exhaustion of planning a big
wedding," he commented.
"I regard the pains and
expenses that go into a great big
wedding as immoral; and such a
thing is usually done for all the
wrong reasonsâ€”for the ego of the
family instead of for the benefit
of the couple."
"Some of the most beautiful
weddings I've administered were
also the simplest."
Napier only insists that he first
feels the two individuals are not
entering into a marriage with any
grave reservations.
"I feel it's my duty to know
the couple before I can agree to
marry them and to give them the
best counseling I can," he
explained.
"The conscientious minister,"
he concluded, "must see his role
as a responsible one."
