# New Financial Center Gets Approval
## 
### TIM COBURN 
The Palo Alto Planning Commission approved at their
July 31st meeting the preliminary plans for a massive
financial complex on the southwest corner of Page Mill
Road and El Camino Real. A model of the complex, on
prominent display at the commission hearing, shows two
ten story buildings, a seventeen story "tower," and
numerous smaller structures including a six or seven story
hotel. The remainder of the approximately 20-acre site
would be paved over to provide the parking facilities
required for an estimated fifteen hundred employees.
The planning commission hearing was required in order
to rezone the site from light industrial and commercial
usage to a P-C designation. The P-C zoning, planned
community, gives the planning commission both more
flexibility and more responsibility in approving the design
of the complex. However, there was little indication on
Wednesday evening that members of the commission
intend to do more than attend to the basic legal and
convenience requirements.
Two modifications of the financial complex were
recommended. Mrs. Mary Gordon suggested that approval
of the complex be given with the condition that at least
200 trees be planted on the property. She stated that
"such broad expanses of asphalt would radiate an
unpleasant amount of heat, and that trees seem to be the
most effective way of absorbing the heat." No size

specifications were mentioned for the trees. The site is
presently ringed by many large eucalyptus trees which
would have to be removed prior to development.
The only other modification, suggested by Walter
Stromquist, was the creation of entrance and exit lanes
for both the Page Mill and El Camino approaches to the
complex. Stromquist is an architect with offices on
Hanover Street in the Stanford Industrial Park.
The public hearing of the planning commission brought
out a scattering of opposition to the proposed complex.
Mrs. Alice Smith, a resident of the nearby residential area,
expressed some concern over the increase in traffic flow as
well as the effect on land costs in the surrounding
residential areas.
She pointed out that the residences on three sides of
the complex, although not adjoining, constituted a major
portion of Palo Alto's low cost housing. These areas are
inhabited mainly by young people and minority members
the community.
Herb Borock, a Stanford student, and Lee Herzenberg,
a staff member expressed similar fears regarding the effect
of an influx of 1500 persons to the immediate area.
Borock felt that the low cost housing would very rapidly
become expensive high rises in the face of this increased
demand. The latter type of housing would effectively
exclude young people and minority groups. The
commission made no specific comments on this problem.

The history of the development of the financial
complex plan runs back some three or four years
according to Tom Ford, the real estate broker who put
together the present package. The commercial value of the
property seems to have been recognized even before then.
A plan for the use of this site by a group of automobile
dealers was turned down by the University and by the city
in the early '60s. Ford and his associate, William Alhouse
started the negotiations with the University for the
financial complex in 1965-66.
They were able to bring together Dillinghan Corp., the
financing group, Albert Hoover Associates, a local
architectural firm, and the University. At present Ford
feels that the financial complex is "the best use of the
property and should enhance the environment for those
who live and work in the area."
He further stated that "the effect on land values in the
surrounding residential areas was not a consideration in
the development of the complex." He did indicate that
the complex would provide additional strength to Palo
Alto's tax base, and he is personally confident that the
city council will approve the planning commission's
recommendation.
Ford was the director of land development at Stanford
from 1960 to 1964, before going into the real estate
brokerage business.

Boyd Smith, Manager of Real
Estate for the University, gave
The Daily additional information
on the financing of the complex.
He stated that the university will
receive a direct prepayment for a
51-year lease on the property with
the possibility of a share in the
profits at some later date.
The entire complex will be
financed and managed by the
Dillingham Corporation with the
exception of the hotel which

Stanford will lease directly to a
local hotel management firm.
Smith was unable to be more
specific since the leases have not
as yet been signed and"the
bidding on the hotel is still open."
Smith was also unable to
release any information on the
value of the property, or the
expected income to Stanford.

However, a rough estimate of the
land value based on a $7 per
square foot value for similar El
Camino frontage is 6 million
dollars.
The value of the buildings will
be in the same range if not more.
Hence, Stanford can expect at
least 5 to 10 million dollars
prepayment on such a lease.

on the financing of the complex.
He stated that the university will
receive a direct prepayment for a
51-year lease on the property with
the possibility of a share in the
profits at some later date.
The entire complex will be
financed and managed by the
Dillingham Corporation with the
exception of the hotel which

Stanford will lease directly to a
local hotel management firm.
Smith was unable to be more
specific since the leases have not
as yet been signed and"the
bidding on the hotel is still open."
Smith was also unable to
release any information on the
value of the property, or the
expected income to Stanford.

However, a rough estimate of the
land value based on a $7 per
square foot value for similar El
Camino frontage is 6 million
dollars.
The value of the buildings will
be in the same range if not more.
Hence, Stanford can expect at
least 5 to 10 million dollars
prepayment on such a lease.
The Palo Alto Planning Commission approved at their
July 31st meeting the preliminary plans for a massive
financial complex on the southwest corner of Page Mill
Road and El Camino Real. A model of the complex, on
prominent display at the commission hearing, shows two
ten story buildings, a seventeen story "tower," and
numerous smaller structures including a six or seven story
hotel. The remainder of the approximately 20-acre site
would be paved over to provide the parking facilities
required for an estimated fifteen hundred employees.
The planning commission hearing was required in order
to rezone the site from light industrial and commercial
usage to a P-C designation. The P-C zoning, planned
community, gives the planning commission both more
flexibility and more responsibility in approving the design
of the complex. However, there was little indication on
Wednesday evening that members of the commission
intend to do more than attend to the basic legal and
convenience requirements.
Two modifications of the financial complex were
recommended. Mrs. Mary Gordon suggested that approval
of the complex be given with the condition that at least
200 trees be planted on the property. She stated that
"such broad expanses of asphalt would radiate an
unpleasant amount of heat, and that trees seem to be the
most effective way of absorbing the heat." No size

specifications were mentioned for the trees. The site is
presently ringed by many large eucalyptus trees which
would have to be removed prior to development.
The only other modification, suggested by Walter
Stromquist, was the creation of entrance and exit lanes
for both the Page Mill and El Camino approaches to the
complex. Stromquist is an architect with offices on
Hanover Street in the Stanford Industrial Park.
The public hearing of the planning commission brought
out a scattering of opposition to the proposed complex.
Mrs. Alice Smith, a resident of the nearby residential area,
expressed some concern over the increase in traffic flow as
well as the effect on land costs in the surrounding
residential areas.
She pointed out that the residences on three sides of
the complex, although not adjoining, constituted a major
portion of Palo Alto's low cost housing. These areas are
inhabited mainly by young people and minority members
the community.
Herb Borock, a Stanford student, and Lee Herzenberg,
a staff member expressed similar fears regarding the effect
of an influx of 1500 persons to the immediate area.
Borock felt that the low cost housing would very rapidly
become expensive high rises in the face of this increased
demand. The latter type of housing would effectively
exclude young people and minority groups. The
commission made no specific comments on this problem.

The history of the development of the financial
complex plan runs back some three or four years
according to Tom Ford, the real estate broker who put
together the present package. The commercial value of the
property seems to have been recognized even before then.
A plan for the use of this site by a group of automobile
dealers was turned down by the University and by the city
in the early '60s. Ford and his associate, William Alhouse
started the negotiations with the University for the
financial complex in 1965-66.
They were able to bring together Dillinghan Corp., the
financing group, Albert Hoover Associates, a local
architectural firm, and the University. At present Ford
feels that the financial complex is "the best use of the
property and should enhance the environment for those
who live and work in the area."
He further stated that "the effect on land values in the
surrounding residential areas was not a consideration in
the development of the complex." He did indicate that
the complex would provide additional strength to Palo
Alto's tax base, and he is personally confident that the
city council will approve the planning commission's
recommendation.
Ford was the director of land development at Stanford
from 1960 to 1964, before going into the real estate
brokerage business.

in the early '60s. Ford and his associate, William Alhouse
started the negotiations with the University for the
financial complex in 1965-66.
They were able to bring together Dillinghan Corp., the
financing group, Albert Hoover Associates, a local
architectural firm, and the University. At present Ford
feels that the financial complex is "the best use of the
property and should enhance the environment for those
who live and work in the area."
He further stated that "the effect on land values in the
surrounding residential areas was not a consideration in
the development of the complex." He did indicate that
the complex would provide additional strength to Palo
Alto's tax base, and he is personally confident that the
city council will approve the planning commission's
recommendation.
Ford was the director of land development at Stanford
from 1960 to 1964, before going into the real estate
brokerage business.
Boyd Smith, Manager of Real
Estate for the University, gave
The Daily additional information
on the financing of the complex.
He stated that the university will
receive a direct prepayment for a
51-year lease on the property with
the possibility of a share in the
profits at some later date.
The entire complex will be
financed and managed by the
Dillingham Corporation with the
exception of the hotel which

Stanford will lease directly to a
local hotel management firm.
Smith was unable to be more
specific since the leases have not
as yet been signed and"the
bidding on the hotel is still open."
Smith was also unable to
release any information on the
value of the property, or the
expected income to Stanford.

However, a rough estimate of the
land value based on a $7 per
square foot value for similar El
Camino frontage is 6 million
dollars.
The value of the buildings will
be in the same range if not more.
Hence, Stanford can expect at
least 5 to 10 million dollars
prepayment on such a lease.
