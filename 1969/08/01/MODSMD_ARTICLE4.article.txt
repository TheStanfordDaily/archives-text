To The Editor:
As one who has been involved in a fight against logging in the
Skyline area for the past several months, I have great sympathy for
those people who are disturbed (perhaps enraged) by the proposed
Coyote Hill industrial park. Regarding your editorial (July 29) however,
I have severe disagreement. You correctly point out that on the whole
the Board of Trustees are de facto representatives of the MIC and opine
(correctly, in my view) that now and in the future, such decisions
should be made from a broader power base, but I think you confuse
two important points.
First, that Stanford is presently a "federal-grant university" there is
little doubt. Many deplore this. I for one believe that the dependence of
the university on the fiscal and regulatory whims of the federal
government must be minimized. But there is no way to maintain
strength and independence without independent financial support.
Stanford must use its resources to maximize its independence under
real world constraints. Can Stanford allow its prime resource, land, to
be nibbled away by freeway and school condemnation or grabbed by
the Army Corps of Engineers for the control of hypothetical Hoods,
and as result be forced to go to its knees before such short sighted men
as Reagan and McClellan. I think not.
Second, the Coyote Hill development is not necessarily an instance
of Stanford using its "resources to enrich the MIC". Stanford has the
opportunity to make a healthy profit to reinforce its independence and,
at the same time, to control the esthetics of the development. No good
revolutionary would be so foolishly idealistic as to throw away a
lucrative source of income, just because it comes from the enemy.
In conclusion, to successfully fight the MIC, Stanford must remain
independent and strong. If Stanford can tax or extort the MIC,
wonderful! This is a standard revolutionary tactic; steal from the rich
and give to the poor. Only two questions remain: 1) Can this
institutional Robin Hood operate without destroying the majesty of his
forest? 2) Can he find the poor?
