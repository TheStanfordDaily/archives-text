## Technology May Improve TV Use 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The information capacity of a standard television channel equals 5
million characters per second of printed text. In a chapter on
"Televistas" in the 1967 report of the Carnegie Commission on
educational TV, "Public Television," J.C.R. Licklider outlined
technological possibilities of this communication resource.
Apart from judgments as to TV's educational and social value, most
of its information potential is now wasted. The pictures on the tube are
completely replaced 30 times a second. Theoretically, one could
squeeze TV into much narrower channels by tricks for encoding the
part of a picture that remains static or flat. But this technology of
"bandwidth compression" is so intricate, that we have only begun to
use it for such demanding purposes as spacecraft photography, and
domestic applications are some years off.
Licklider suggests that we trade off the wasteful cinematic use of the
channel in favor of more numerous but static images. For example, the
whole text of a 30-page newspaper could be transmitted every second.
Existing technology could maintain a newspaper broadcast constantly
updated for the latest news. The user's console would switch the page
he selects out of each one-second transmission, onto a persistent display
screen for leisurely perusal. "Hard copies," or print on paper, are
already available by radio facsimile, but the machinery to make them
quickly is likely to remain relatively expensive while the costs of
electronic gear move sharply down.
In fact, the world's total information flow in print at the present
time is less than the capacity of a single channel. Instant publication
would be achievable by broadcasting that flow, together with
identification codes, so that selected materials could be stored on each
user's tape recorder for replay at leisure. High fidelity audio for voice,
music or radio theater takes appreciable spectrum space, but at least 50
audio channels could be bundled into one TV channel on the same
basis.
One of the most stultifying aspects of TV as a cultural phenomenon
is the passivity of watching what happens to come in a given program.
We have little opportunity for critical choice based on advance
information. And even if we are in the mood for hearing about a given
topic, possibly magnificently dramatized, our mood must match the
minute and the day of the telecast. These new technologies begin to
show us how to bring the viewer's mind back into the system.
The viewer could also participate actively by being his own director
of a telecast. Let different cameras feed into different subchannels, and
the viewer can decide whether to follow the nominal program or make
his own decisions about close-ups, side angles or freezing a scene. The
essential point is to restore the maximum freedom of choice to the
individual.
Existing channel capacity for television is essentially exhausted,
leaving no room for such innovations without displacing established
interests. Cable TV is theoretically open-ended, but the actual systems
now being organized will furnish about 20 new channel opportunities
for homes in urban areas. Trials of pay TV are a social experiment for
new ways of financing programs to satisfy tastes repelled by the
prevailing system of mass advertising.
In the current battle for control, the public interest cannot be -and
should not be expected to beâ€”fairly represented by the profit-oriented
groups, although they do provide the essential drive for development
and action. The Federal Communications Commission has the
responsibility to direct that drive for the public interest.
In recent years, the FCC has shown a renewed vivacity in
questioning squatters' rights and in opening up technological
opportunities. In its preoccupations with current tangled conflicts, the
FCC should not overlook the need to manage spectrum space so as to
hasten new technological antidotes to the present miasma.
