# Guest Column
## IIC, SRI And The Nazis 
### Barbara Lee 
(Editor's Note: This article, based on research by
Larry Christiani of the Pacific Studies Center, is in
answer to a suggestion by Steven G. Ungar, stated in
a July 25 Daily letter to the Editor, that Marc Sapir
support his claims, which appeared in a Daily
column published July 23, that it was men like
those attending the International Industrial
Conference, "(in some cases the very same men)
who were the main political and economic power
base behind Adolf Hitler.")
"An international business operating throughout the world
should conduct its operations in strictly business terms,
without regard to the political beliefs of its management, or
the political beliefs of the country in which it is operating."
—Alfred Sloan, Jr., Chairman
of General Motors, 1939
Beginning on September 15 at San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel, SRI will sponsor the fourth
quadrennial International Industrial Conference—a
meeting of 500 of the world's most august
corporate leaders from over sixty countries. The
reason for this "Gathering of the 500" is the
coordination of business ventures among the highly
developed nations and their economic appendages in
the Third World.
Marc Sapir, in his Daily column of July 23, draws
a perceptive analogy between the involvement of
American business in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,
and its involvement in the Nazi war economy up to
1941. In each case, profit is the motivation and
political morality either a hindrance or a convenient
jingoistic tool. This is far more than an analogy,
however. In a letter to the Editor, dated July 25,
Marc is challenged to prove to "the Stanford
Community, the U.S., (and) the whole world" that
the lIC will boast participants who were members of
the main political and economic power base behind
Adolph Hitler." Although the Top 500 are now
more concerned with reaping millions in the
under-developed countries, they represent the same
firms who fattened themselves off the German
militarization of the 30's. It is important to realize
the consistency of their activities over the decades;
time and places change, but war profiteering, secret
agreements, and the subordination of human life to
profits are constants.
First, let's look at the German industrialists and
their participation in the lIC. Krupp Steel Works
(now Krupp-Konzern, the 29th largest foreign firm)
grew to a fantastic munitions dynasty under Hitler;
Herr Alfred Krupp himself was responsible for a
plan for corporate contributions to the Nazi Party.
The lIC of 1957 featured his son as the keynote
speaker.
The Thysson family, who contributed over 100
million marks to Hitler in 1931 and helped run the
gigantic United Steel Works in war-time Germany,
still controls August-Tliysson-Hutte (the fifteenth
largest corporation outside the U.S.) Dr.
Hans-Gunther Sohl, chairman of the company, was
among those present at the 1965 lIC. Germany's
largest aircraft producer during the war, Siemens
and lllaske A.G., was represented at the 1965 lIC
by both the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the
Board. And Ernst Wolf Mommsen, now with
Phoenix-Hcinrohr A.G., also attended the 1965
Conference. Mommsen was a little more well known
during the war; he was Head of the Central Division
of the German Ministry of Armament, 1940-45.
By far the most important German war-time
producer, and the one most tied up with American
firms, was I.G. Farbrn. According to Judge Herbert
at the Nuremberg Trials, I.G. "was integrated in the
governmental planning and preparation for war and
became one of Hitler's greatest assets." It controlled
some 280 German firms, and produced 95% of
poisonous gases (including gas used at Auschwitz),
88% of the magnesium, and 84% of the explosives
for the military. Secret files discovered in 1945
revealed that I.G. employed a total of 79,500
S.S.-supplied prisoners of war and concentration
camp victims in its factories. This little favor from
the Reich should have surprised no-one - I.G. began
its support of Hitler with a contribution of over
400,000 marks in the 1933 election.
Former chairman of I.G. Farben, Carl Wurster, is
now chairman of lladische Anilin and Soda Fabrik
(West Germany's largest chemical company), and
partner with America's Dow Chemical in Dow
Badiache Chemical Co. of Freeport, Texas. Rolf
Magner represented Badische Anilin at the 1965 lIC.
One of his previous assignments was to serve as
Germany's Commercial attache in Tokyo, 1944-45.

Old Nazis just don't fade away, it seems. But we
have yet to see how American firms participating in
the lIC are implicated in the war-profiteering game.

In 1937, 26 of the* top 100 U.S. corporations
were involved in contractual agreements with
German industry—these 26 accounted for 60% of
the total assets of the 100. 53 American firms were
working with I.G. Farben alone, and none had a
cozier relationship with I.G. than Standard Oil of
New Jersey.
Standard concluded a secret agreement in 1926
granting I.G. the use of a hydrogeneration process
for the production of high-grade motor fuel. A
Standard put it "this means absolutely the
independence of Europe on the matter of gasoline
supply." I.G. promised to stay out of the oil
business, and Standard promised to stay out of
chemicals, and in addition presented a "gift" of
546,000 shares of its stock.
Even more crucial was Standard's technical
assistance in the production of synthetic rubber in
1938. This assistance "made it possible for the
Reich to carry on the war independently of foreign
supplies." Standard also gave I.G. control of its
patents in ammonia synthesis (for explosives
production).
In 1936, the German Ministry of Economics
supplied I.G. with 20 million dollars for the
stockpiling of aviation fuel through Standard. The
Gestapo received the following statement from I.G.
in 1944: "Americans have supplied us with plants
ready for production and supplied us with all
available experience."
Standard clearly felt that it had something to
gain from complete cooperation with I.G. and
Hitler. It did. Along with General Motors, Standard
owned 50% of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation and
alone sold 30% of the motor fuel in Germany. J.R.
White, current Vice-President, sits on the 1969 lIC
Policy Board, and David Rockefeller is General
Chairman of the lIC.
Dow Chemical Co. and Alcoa were also
intimately involved with I.G. Farben. From 1931 to
1934, Alcoa and I.G. pulled Dow, the sole producer
of magnesium into an agreement giving its European
export rights to I.G. By 1939, German magnesium
output was five times greater than U.S. output. A
Dow spokesman at the Investigation of the National
Defense Program (1941-46) stated that "we do not
inquire into the use of our products. We are
interested in selling them."
I.G. also benefited from close cooperation with
Du Pont (which sent ' Vice-President R. Russell
Pippin to the 1965 IIC), and Union Carbide (whose
chairman, Birny Mason, Jr. sits on the 1969 Policy
Board).
A variety of other American firms sank their
teeth into all parts of the German military market.
By 1930, General Motor's Opel and Ford were the
Reich's largest tank producers, and GM was
reinvesting all of its profits back into the German
economy. In 1936, GM-controlled Bendix Aviation
arranged with Siemens and Hlaske, A.G. for the free
exchange of data on automatic pilots and other
aircraft instruments, and with Robert Bosch for the
provision of complete information on aircraft and
diesel engine starters. The philosophy behind Ford
and GM's policies is concisely expressed in the
quote that precedes this article. Henry Ford II and
Frederick G. Donner, Board Chairman of GM
attended the 1965 lIC.
U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel arranged with
German steel-makers in 1939 to break a restriction
on Latin America production and ship this all
important war material to German distributors.
Stewart S. Cort, President of Bethlehem Steel, and
Roger Blough of U.S. Steel were among those
gathered at the lIC in 1965. Blough is on the 1969
lIC Policy Board.
The listing of names, dates and agreements could
go on and on. The facts are clear enough. German
and American businesses collaborated to catch the
gravy from pre-World War II militarization. Today,
these same corporations and their counterparts in
other countries have extended their operations into
every corner of the globe in search of vital raw
materials, markets, and outlets for investment
capital. Standard Oil of New Jersey, once working
closely with Hitler's gas-maker I.G. Farben, now
controls 275 subsidiaries in 52 countries, has sales in
more than 100 countries, and derives 2/3 of its total
profits from its overseas business. The heads of
Standard and hundreds of its multinational brethren
will meet at the lIC to consolidate their control over
the resources, markets, and peoples of the Third
World. Men like this should not be permitted to
assemble anvwhere on the face of the earth.

by both the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the
Board. And Ernst Wolf Mommsen, now with
Phoenix-Hcinrohr A.G., also attended the 1965
Conference. Mommsen was a little more well known
during the war; he was Head of the Central Division
of the German Ministry of Armament, 1940-45.
By far the most important German war-time
producer, and the one most tied up with American
firms, was I.G. Farbrn. According to Judge Herbert
at the Nuremberg Trials, I.G. "was integrated in the
governmental planning and preparation for war and
became one of Hitler's greatest assets." It controlled
some 280 German firms, and produced 95% of
poisonous gases (including gas used at Auschwitz),
88% of the magnesium, and 84% of the explosives
for the military. Secret files discovered in 1945
revealed that I.G. employed a total of 79,500
S.S.-supplied prisoners of war and concentration
camp victims in its factories. This little favor from
the Reich should have surprised no-one - I.G. began
its support of Hitler with a contribution of over
400,000 marks in the 1933 election.
Former chairman of I.G. Farben, Carl Wurster, is
now chairman of lladische Anilin and Soda Fabrik
(West Germany's largest chemical company), and
partner with America's Dow Chemical in Dow
Badiache Chemical Co. of Freeport, Texas. Rolf
Magner represented Badische Anilin at the 1965 lIC.
One of his previous assignments was to serve as
Germany's Commercial attache in Tokyo, 1944-45.

Old Nazis just don't fade away, it seems. But we
have yet to see how American firms participating in
the lIC are implicated in the war-profiteering game.

In 1937, 26 of the* top 100 U.S. corporations
were involved in contractual agreements with
German industry—these 26 accounted for 60% of
the total assets of the 100. 53 American firms were
working with I.G. Farben alone, and none had a
cozier relationship with I.G. than Standard Oil of
New Jersey.
Standard concluded a secret agreement in 1926
granting I.G. the use of a hydrogeneration process
for the production of high-grade motor fuel. A
Standard put it "this means absolutely the
independence of Europe on the matter of gasoline
supply." I.G. promised to stay out of the oil
business, and Standard promised to stay out of
chemicals, and in addition presented a "gift" of
546,000 shares of its stock.
Even more crucial was Standard's technical
assistance in the production of synthetic rubber in
1938. This assistance "made it possible for the
Reich to carry on the war independently of foreign
supplies." Standard also gave I.G. control of its
patents in ammonia synthesis (for explosives
production).
In 1936, the German Ministry of Economics
supplied I.G. with 20 million dollars for the
stockpiling of aviation fuel through Standard. The
Gestapo received the following statement from I.G.
in 1944: "Americans have supplied us with plants
ready for production and supplied us with all
available experience."
Standard clearly felt that it had something to
gain from complete cooperation with I.G. and
Hitler. It did. Along with General Motors, Standard
owned 50% of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation and
alone sold 30% of the motor fuel in Germany. J.R.
White, current Vice-President, sits on the 1969 lIC
Policy Board, and David Rockefeller is General
Chairman of the lIC.
Dow Chemical Co. and Alcoa were also
intimately involved with I.G. Farben. From 1931 to
1934, Alcoa and I.G. pulled Dow, the sole producer
of magnesium into an agreement giving its European
export rights to I.G. By 1939, German magnesium
output was five times greater than U.S. output. A
Dow spokesman at the Investigation of the National
Defense Program (1941-46) stated that "we do not
inquire into the use of our products. We are
interested in selling them."
I.G. also benefited from close cooperation with
Du Pont (which sent ' Vice-President R. Russell
Pippin to the 1965 IIC), and Union Carbide (whose
chairman, Birny Mason, Jr. sits on the 1969 Policy
Board).
A variety of other American firms sank their
teeth into all parts of the German military market.
By 1930, General Motor's Opel and Ford were the
Reich's largest tank producers, and GM was
reinvesting all of its profits back into the German
economy. In 1936, GM-controlled Bendix Aviation
arranged with Siemens and Hlaske, A.G. for the free
exchange of data on automatic pilots and other
aircraft instruments, and with Robert Bosch for the
provision of complete information on aircraft and
diesel engine starters. The philosophy behind Ford
and GM's policies is concisely expressed in the
quote that precedes this article. Henry Ford II and
Frederick G. Donner, Board Chairman of GM
attended the 1965 lIC.
U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel arranged with
German steel-makers in 1939 to break a restriction
on Latin America production and ship this all
important war material to German distributors.
Stewart S. Cort, President of Bethlehem Steel, and
Roger Blough of U.S. Steel were among those
gathered at the lIC in 1965. Blough is on the 1969
lIC Policy Board.
The listing of names, dates and agreements could
go on and on. The facts are clear enough. German
and American businesses collaborated to catch the
gravy from pre-World War II militarization. Today,
these same corporations and their counterparts in
other countries have extended their operations into
every corner of the globe in search of vital raw
materials, markets, and outlets for investment
capital. Standard Oil of New Jersey, once working
closely with Hitler's gas-maker I.G. Farben, now
controls 275 subsidiaries in 52 countries, has sales in
more than 100 countries, and derives 2/3 of its total
profits from its overseas business. The heads of
Standard and hundreds of its multinational brethren
will meet at the lIC to consolidate their control over
the resources, markets, and peoples of the Third
World. Men like this should not be permitted to
assemble anvwhere on the face of the earth.
(Editor's Note: This article, based on research by
Larry Christiani of the Pacific Studies Center, is in
answer to a suggestion by Steven G. Ungar, stated in
a July 25 Daily letter to the Editor, that Marc Sapir
support his claims, which appeared in a Daily
column published July 23, that it was men like
those attending the International Industrial
Conference, "(in some cases the very same men)
who were the main political and economic power
base behind Adolf Hitler.")
"An international business operating throughout the world
should conduct its operations in strictly business terms,
without regard to the political beliefs of its management, or
the political beliefs of the country in which it is operating."
—Alfred Sloan, Jr., Chairman
of General Motors, 1939
Beginning on September 15 at San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel, SRI will sponsor the fourth
quadrennial International Industrial Conference—a
meeting of 500 of the world's most august
corporate leaders from over sixty countries. The
reason for this "Gathering of the 500" is the
coordination of business ventures among the highly
developed nations and their economic appendages in
the Third World.
Marc Sapir, in his Daily column of July 23, draws
a perceptive analogy between the involvement of
American business in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,
and its involvement in the Nazi war economy up to
1941. In each case, profit is the motivation and
political morality either a hindrance or a convenient
jingoistic tool. This is far more than an analogy,
however. In a letter to the Editor, dated July 25,
Marc is challenged to prove to "the Stanford
Community, the U.S., (and) the whole world" that
the lIC will boast participants who were members of
the main political and economic power base behind
Adolph Hitler." Although the Top 500 are now
more concerned with reaping millions in the
under-developed countries, they represent the same
firms who fattened themselves off the German
militarization of the 30's. It is important to realize
the consistency of their activities over the decades;
time and places change, but war profiteering, secret
agreements, and the subordination of human life to
profits are constants.
First, let's look at the German industrialists and
their participation in the lIC. Krupp Steel Works
(now Krupp-Konzern, the 29th largest foreign firm)
grew to a fantastic munitions dynasty under Hitler;
Herr Alfred Krupp himself was responsible for a
plan for corporate contributions to the Nazi Party.
The lIC of 1957 featured his son as the keynote
speaker.
The Thysson family, who contributed over 100
million marks to Hitler in 1931 and helped run the
gigantic United Steel Works in war-time Germany,
still controls August-Tliysson-Hutte (the fifteenth
largest corporation outside the U.S.) Dr.
Hans-Gunther Sohl, chairman of the company, was
among those present at the 1965 lIC. Germany's
largest aircraft producer during the war, Siemens
and lllaske A.G., was represented at the 1965 lIC
by both the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the
Board. And Ernst Wolf Mommsen, now with

In 1936, the German Ministry of Economics
supplied I.G. with 20 million dollars for the
stockpiling of aviation fuel through Standard. The
Gestapo received the following statement from I.G.
in 1944: "Americans have supplied us with plants
ready for production and supplied us with all
available experience."
Standard clearly felt that it had something to
gain from complete cooperation with I.G. and
Hitler. It did. Along with General Motors, Standard
owned 50% of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation and
alone sold 30% of the motor fuel in Germany. J.R.
White, current Vice-President, sits on the 1969 lIC
Policy Board, and David Rockefeller is General
Chairman of the lIC.
Dow Chemical Co. and Alcoa were also
intimately involved with I.G. Farben. From 1931 to
1934, Alcoa and I.G. pulled Dow, the sole producer
of magnesium into an agreement giving its European
export rights to I.G. By 1939, German magnesium
output was five times greater than U.S. output. A
Dow spokesman at the Investigation of the National
Defense Program (1941-46) stated that "we do not
inquire into the use of our products. We are
interested in selling them."
I.G. also benefited from close cooperation with
Du Pont (which sent ' Vice-President R. Russell
Pippin to the 1965 IIC), and Union Carbide (whose
chairman, Birny Mason, Jr. sits on the 1969 Policy
Board).
A variety of other American firms sank their
teeth into all parts of the German military market.
By 1930, General Motor's Opel and Ford were the
Reich's largest tank producers, and GM was
reinvesting all of its profits back into the German
economy. In 1936, GM-controlled Bendix Aviation
arranged with Siemens and Hlaske, A.G. for the free
exchange of data on automatic pilots and other
aircraft instruments, and with Robert Bosch for the
provision of complete information on aircraft and
diesel engine starters. The philosophy behind Ford
and GM's policies is concisely expressed in the
quote that precedes this article. Henry Ford II and
Frederick G. Donner, Board Chairman of GM
attended the 1965 lIC.
U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel arranged with
German steel-makers in 1939 to break a restriction
on Latin America production and ship this all
important war material to German distributors.
Stewart S. Cort, President of Bethlehem Steel, and
Roger Blough of U.S. Steel were among those
gathered at the lIC in 1965. Blough is on the 1969
lIC Policy Board.
The listing of names, dates and agreements could
go on and on. The facts are clear enough. German
and American businesses collaborated to catch the
gravy from pre-World War II militarization. Today,
these same corporations and their counterparts in
other countries have extended their operations into
every corner of the globe in search of vital raw
materials, markets, and outlets for investment
capital. Standard Oil of New Jersey, once working
closely with Hitler's gas-maker I.G. Farben, now
controls 275 subsidiaries in 52 countries, has sales in
more than 100 countries, and derives 2/3 of its total
profits from its overseas business. The heads of
Standard and hundreds of its multinational brethren
will meet at the lIC to consolidate their control over
the resources, markets, and peoples of the Third
World. Men like this should not be permitted to
assemble anvwhere on the face of the earth.
(Editor's Note: This article, based on research by
Larry Christiani of the Pacific Studies Center, is in
answer to a suggestion by Steven G. Ungar, stated in
a July 25 Daily letter to the Editor, that Marc Sapir
support his claims, which appeared in a Daily
column published July 23, that it was men like
those attending the International Industrial
Conference, "(in some cases the very same men)
who were the main political and economic power
base behind Adolf Hitler.")
"An international business operating throughout the world
should conduct its operations in strictly business terms,
without regard to the political beliefs of its management, or
the political beliefs of the country in which it is operating."

of General Motors, 1939
Beginning on September 15 at San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel, SRI will sponsor the fourth
quadrennial International Industrial Conference—a
meeting of 500 of the world's most august
corporate leaders from over sixty countries. The
reason for this "Gathering of the 500" is the
coordination of business ventures among the highly
developed nations and their economic appendages in
the Third World.
Marc Sapir, in his Daily column of July 23, draws
a perceptive analogy between the involvement of
American business in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,
and its involvement in the Nazi war economy up to
1941. In each case, profit is the motivation and
political morality either a hindrance or a convenient
jingoistic tool. This is far more than an analogy,
however. In a letter to the Editor, dated July 25,
Marc is challenged to prove to "the Stanford
Community, the U.S., (and) the whole world" that
the lIC will boast participants who were members of
the main political and economic power base behind
Adolph Hitler." Although the Top 500 are now
more concerned with reaping millions in the
under-developed countries, they represent the same
firms who fattened themselves off the German
militarization of the 30's. It is important to realize
the consistency of their activities over the decades;
time and places change, but war profiteering, secret
agreements, and the subordination of human life to
profits are constants.
First, let's look at the German industrialists and
their participation in the lIC. Krupp Steel Works
(now Krupp-Konzern, the 29th largest foreign firm)
grew to a fantastic munitions dynasty under Hitler;
Herr Alfred Krupp himself was responsible for a
plan for corporate contributions to the Nazi Party.
The lIC of 1957 featured his son as the keynote
speaker.
The Thysson family, who contributed over 100
million marks to Hitler in 1931 and helped run the
gigantic United Steel Works in war-time Germany,
still controls August-Tliysson-Hutte (the fifteenth
largest corporation outside the U.S.) Dr.
Hans-Gunther Sohl, chairman of the company, was
among those present at the 1965 lIC. Germany's
largest aircraft producer during the war, Siemens
and lllaske A.G., was represented at the 1965 lIC
by both the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the
Board. And Ernst Wolf Mommsen, now with
Phoenix-Hcinrohr A.G., also attended the 1965
Conference. Mommsen was a little more well known
during the war; he was Head of the Central Division
of the German Ministry of Armament, 1940-45.
By far the most important German war-time
producer, and the one most tied up with American
firms, was I.G. Farbrn. According to Judge Herbert
at the Nuremberg Trials, I.G. "was integrated in the
governmental planning and preparation for war and
became one of Hitler's greatest assets." It controlled
some 280 German firms, and produced 95% of
poisonous gases (including gas used at Auschwitz),
88% of the magnesium, and 84% of the explosives
for the military. Secret files discovered in 1945
revealed that I.G. employed a total of 79,500
S.S.-supplied prisoners of war and concentration
camp victims in its factories. This little favor from
the Reich should have surprised no-one - I.G. began
its support of Hitler with a contribution of over
400,000 marks in the 1933 election.
Former chairman of I.G. Farben, Carl Wurster, is
now chairman of lladische Anilin and Soda Fabrik
(West Germany's largest chemical company), and
partner with America's Dow Chemical in Dow
Badiache Chemical Co. of Freeport, Texas. Rolf
Magner represented Badische Anilin at the 1965 lIC.
One of his previous assignments was to serve as
Germany's Commercial attache in Tokyo, 1944-45.

Old Nazis just don't fade away, it seems. But we
have yet to see how American firms participating in
the lIC are implicated in the war-profiteering game.

In 1937, 26 of the* top 100 U.S. corporations
were involved in contractual agreements with
German industry—these 26 accounted for 60% of
the total assets of the 100. 53 American firms were
working with I.G. Farben alone, and none had a
cozier relationship with I.G. than Standard Oil of
New Jersey.
Standard concluded a secret agreement in 1926
granting I.G. the use of a hydrogeneration process
for the production of high-grade motor fuel. A
Standard put it "this means absolutely the
independence of Europe on the matter of gasoline
supply." I.G. promised to stay out of the oil
business, and Standard promised to stay out of
chemicals, and in addition presented a "gift" of
546,000 shares of its stock.
Even more crucial was Standard's technical
assistance in the production of synthetic rubber in
1938. This assistance "made it possible for the
Reich to carry on the war independently of foreign
supplies." Standard also gave I.G. control of its
patents in ammonia synthesis (for explosives
production).
In 1936, the German Ministry of Economics
supplied I.G. with 20 million dollars for the
stockpiling of aviation fuel through Standard. The
Gestapo received the following statement from I.G.

closely with Hitler's gas-maker I.G. Farben, now
controls 275 subsidiaries in 52 countries, has sales in
more than 100 countries, and derives 2/3 of its total
profits from its overseas business. The heads of

will meet at the lIC to consolidate their control over

a July 25 Daily letter to the Editor, that Marc Sapir

"An international business operating throughout the world

Beginning on September 15 at San Francisco's
Fairmont Hotel, SRI will sponsor the fourth
quadrennial International Industrial Conference—a
meeting of 500 of the world's most august
corporate leaders from over sixty countries. The
reason for this "Gathering of the 500" is the
coordination of business ventures among the highly
developed nations and their economic appendages in
the Third World.
Marc Sapir, in his Daily column of July 23, draws
a perceptive analogy between the involvement of
American business in Vietnam and Southeast Asia,
and its involvement in the Nazi war economy up to
1941. In each case, profit is the motivation and
political morality either a hindrance or a convenient
jingoistic tool. This is far more than an analogy,
however. In a letter to the Editor, dated July 25,
Marc is challenged to prove to "the Stanford
Community, the U.S., (and) the whole world" that
the lIC will boast participants who were members of
the main political and economic power base behind
Adolph Hitler." Although the Top 500 are now
more concerned with reaping millions in the
under-developed countries, they represent the same
firms who fattened themselves off the German
militarization of the 30's. It is important to realize
the consistency of their activities over the decades;
time and places change, but war profiteering, secret
agreements, and the subordination of human life to
profits are constants.
First, let's look at the German industrialists and
their participation in the lIC. Krupp Steel Works
(now Krupp-Konzern, the 29th largest foreign firm)
grew to a fantastic munitions dynasty under Hitler;
Herr Alfred Krupp himself was responsible for a
plan for corporate contributions to the Nazi Party.
The lIC of 1957 featured his son as the keynote
speaker.
The Thysson family, who contributed over 100
million marks to Hitler in 1931 and helped run the
gigantic United Steel Works in war-time Germany,
still controls August-Tliysson-Hutte (the fifteenth
largest corporation outside the U.S.) Dr.
Hans-Gunther Sohl, chairman of the company, was
among those present at the 1965 lIC. Germany's
largest aircraft producer during the war, Siemens
and lllaske A.G., was represented at the 1965 lIC
by both the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the
Board. And Ernst Wolf Mommsen, now with
Phoenix-Hcinrohr A.G., also attended the 1965
Conference. Mommsen was a little more well known
during the war; he was Head of the Central Division
of the German Ministry of Armament, 1940-45.
By far the most important German war-time
producer, and the one most tied up with American
firms, was I.G. Farbrn. According to Judge Herbert
at the Nuremberg Trials, I.G. "was integrated in the
governmental planning and preparation for war and
became one of Hitler's greatest assets." It controlled
some 280 German firms, and produced 95% of
poisonous gases (including gas used at Auschwitz),
88% of the magnesium, and 84% of the explosives
for the military. Secret files discovered in 1945
revealed that I.G. employed a total of 79,500
S.S.-supplied prisoners of war and concentration
camp victims in its factories. This little favor from
the Reich should have surprised no-one - I.G. began
its support of Hitler with a contribution of over
400,000 marks in the 1933 election.
Former chairman of I.G. Farben, Carl Wurster, is
now chairman of lladische Anilin and Soda Fabrik
(West Germany's largest chemical company), and
partner with America's Dow Chemical in Dow
Badiache Chemical Co. of Freeport, Texas. Rolf
Magner represented Badische Anilin at the 1965 lIC.
One of his previous assignments was to serve as
Germany's Commercial attache in Tokyo, 1944-45.
* * *
Old Nazis just don't fade away, it seems. But we
have yet to see how American firms participating in
the lIC are implicated in the war-profiteering game.

In 1937, 26 of the* top 100 U.S. corporations
were involved in contractual agreements with
German industry—these 26 accounted for 60% of
the total assets of the 100. 53 American firms were
working with I.G. Farben alone, and none had a
cozier relationship with I.G. than Standard Oil of
New Jersey.
Standard concluded a secret agreement in 1926
granting I.G. the use of a hydrogeneration process
for the production of high-grade motor fuel. A
Standard put it "this means absolutely the
independence of Europe on the matter of gasoline
supply." I.G. promised to stay out of the oil
business, and Standard promised to stay out of
chemicals, and in addition presented a "gift" of
546,000 shares of its stock.
Even more crucial was Standard's technical
assistance in the production of synthetic rubber in
1938. This assistance "made it possible for the
Reich to carry on the war independently of foreign
supplies." Standard also gave I.G. control of its
patents in ammonia synthesis (for explosives
production).
In 1936, the German Ministry of Economics
supplied I.G. with 20 million dollars for the
stockpiling of aviation fuel through Standard. The
Gestapo received the following statement from I.G.
in 1944: "Americans have supplied us with plants
ready for production and supplied us with all
available experience."
Standard clearly felt that it had something to
gain from complete cooperation with I.G. and
Hitler. It did. Along with General Motors, Standard
owned 50% of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation and
alone sold 30% of the motor fuel in Germany. J.R.
White, current Vice-President, sits on the 1969 lIC
Policy Board, and David Rockefeller is General
Chairman of the lIC.
Dow Chemical Co. and Alcoa were also
intimately involved with I.G. Farben. From 1931 to
1934, Alcoa and I.G. pulled Dow, the sole producer
of magnesium into an agreement giving its European
export rights to I.G. By 1939, German magnesium
output was five times greater than U.S. output. A
Dow spokesman at the Investigation of the National
Defense Program (1941-46) stated that "we do not
inquire into the use of our products. We are
interested in selling them."
I.G. also benefited from close cooperation with
Du Pont (which sent ' Vice-President R. Russell
Pippin to the 1965 IIC), and Union Carbide (whose
chairman, Birny Mason, Jr. sits on the 1969 Policy
Board).
A variety of other American firms sank their
teeth into all parts of the German military market.
By 1930, General Motor's Opel and Ford were the
Reich's largest tank producers, and GM was
reinvesting all of its profits back into the German
economy. In 1936, GM-controlled Bendix Aviation
arranged with Siemens and Hlaske, A.G. for the free
exchange of data on automatic pilots and other
aircraft instruments, and with Robert Bosch for the
provision of complete information on aircraft and
diesel engine starters. The philosophy behind Ford
and GM's policies is concisely expressed in the
quote that precedes this article. Henry Ford II and
Frederick G. Donner, Board Chairman of GM
attended the 1965 lIC.
U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel arranged with
German steel-makers in 1939 to break a restriction
on Latin America production and ship this all
important war material to German distributors.
Stewart S. Cort, President of Bethlehem Steel, and
Roger Blough of U.S. Steel were among those
gathered at the lIC in 1965. Blough is on the 1969
lIC Policy Board.
The listing of names, dates and agreements could
go on and on. The facts are clear enough. German
and American businesses collaborated to catch the
gravy from pre-World War II militarization. Today,
these same corporations and their counterparts in
other countries have extended their operations into
every corner of the globe in search of vital raw
materials, markets, and outlets for investment
capital. Standard Oil of New Jersey, once working
closely with Hitler's gas-maker I.G. Farben, now
controls 275 subsidiaries in 52 countries, has sales in
more than 100 countries, and derives 2/3 of its total

million marks to Hitler in 1931 and helped run the
gigantic United Steel Works in war-time Germany,
still controls August-Tliysson-Hutte (the fifteenth
largest corporation outside the U.S.) Dr.
Hans-Gunther Sohl, chairman of the company, was
among those present at the 1965 lIC. Germany's
largest aircraft producer during the war, Siemens
and lllaske A.G., was represented at the 1965 lIC
by both the Chairman and the Vice-Chairman of the
Board. And Ernst Wolf Mommsen, now with
Phoenix-Hcinrohr A.G., also attended the 1965
Conference. Mommsen was a little more well known
during the war; he was Head of the Central Division
of the German Ministry of Armament, 1940-45.
By far the most important German war-time
producer, and the one most tied up with American
firms, was I.G. Farbrn. According to Judge Herbert
at the Nuremberg Trials, I.G. "was integrated in the
governmental planning and preparation for war and
became one of Hitler's greatest assets." It controlled
some 280 German firms, and produced 95% of
poisonous gases (including gas used at Auschwitz),
88% of the magnesium, and 84% of the explosives
for the military. Secret files discovered in 1945
revealed that I.G. employed a total of 79,500
S.S.-supplied prisoners of war and concentration
camp victims in its factories. This little favor from
the Reich should have surprised no-one - I.G. began
its support of Hitler with a contribution of over
400,000 marks in the 1933 election.
Former chairman of I.G. Farben, Carl Wurster, is
now chairman of lladische Anilin and Soda Fabrik
(West Germany's largest chemical company), and
partner with America's Dow Chemical in Dow
Badiache Chemical Co. of Freeport, Texas. Rolf
Magner represented Badische Anilin at the 1965 lIC.
One of his previous assignments was to serve as
Germany's Commercial attache in Tokyo, 1944-45.

Old Nazis just don't fade away, it seems. But we
have yet to see how American firms participating in
the lIC are implicated in the war-profiteering game.

In 1937, 26 of the* top 100 U.S. corporations
were involved in contractual agreements with
German industry—these 26 accounted for 60% of
the total assets of the 100. 53 American firms were
working with I.G. Farben alone, and none had a
cozier relationship with I.G. than Standard Oil of
New Jersey.
Standard concluded a secret agreement in 1926
granting I.G. the use of a hydrogeneration process
for the production of high-grade motor fuel. A
Standard put it "this means absolutely the
independence of Europe on the matter of gasoline
supply." I.G. promised to stay out of the oil
business, and Standard promised to stay out of
chemicals, and in addition presented a "gift" of
546,000 shares of its stock.
Even more crucial was Standard's technical
assistance in the production of synthetic rubber in
1938. This assistance "made it possible for the
Reich to carry on the war independently of foreign
supplies." Standard also gave I.G. control of its
patents in ammonia synthesis (for explosives
production).
In 1936, the German Ministry of Economics
supplied I.G. with 20 million dollars for the
stockpiling of aviation fuel through Standard. The
Gestapo received the following statement from I.G.
in 1944: "Americans have supplied us with plants
ready for production and supplied us with all
available experience."
Standard clearly felt that it had something to
gain from complete cooperation with I.G. and
Hitler. It did. Along with General Motors, Standard
owned 50% of the Ethyl Gasoline Corporation and
alone sold 30% of the motor fuel in Germany. J.R.
White, current Vice-President, sits on the 1969 lIC
Policy Board, and David Rockefeller is General
Chairman of the lIC.
Dow Chemical Co. and Alcoa were also
intimately involved with I.G. Farben. From 1931 to
1934, Alcoa and I.G. pulled Dow, the sole producer
of magnesium into an agreement giving its European
export rights to I.G. By 1939, German magnesium
output was five times greater than U.S. output. A
Dow spokesman at the Investigation of the National
Defense Program (1941-46) stated that "we do not
inquire into the use of our products. We are
interested in selling them."
I.G. also benefited from close cooperation with
Du Pont (which sent ' Vice-President R. Russell
Pippin to the 1965 IIC), and Union Carbide (whose
chairman, Birny Mason, Jr. sits on the 1969 Policy
Board).
A variety of other American firms sank their
teeth into all parts of the German military market.
By 1930, General Motor's Opel and Ford were the
Reich's largest tank producers, and GM was
reinvesting all of its profits back into the German
economy. In 1936, GM-controlled Bendix Aviation
arranged with Siemens and Hlaske, A.G. for the free
exchange of data on automatic pilots and other
aircraft instruments, and with Robert Bosch for the
provision of complete information on aircraft and
diesel engine starters. The philosophy behind Ford
and GM's policies is concisely expressed in the
quote that precedes this article. Henry Ford II and
Frederick G. Donner, Board Chairman of GM
attended the 1965 lIC.
U.S. Steel and Bethlehem Steel arranged with
German steel-makers in 1939 to break a restriction
on Latin America production and ship this all
important war material to German distributors.
Stewart S. Cort, President of Bethlehem Steel, and
Roger Blough of U.S. Steel were among those
gathered at the lIC in 1965. Blough is on the 1969
lIC Policy Board.
The listing of names, dates and agreements could
go on and on. The facts are clear enough. German
and American businesses collaborated to catch the
gravy from pre-World War II militarization. Today,
these same corporations and their counterparts in
other countries have extended their operations into
every corner of the globe in search of vital raw
materials, markets, and outlets for investment
capital. Standard Oil of New Jersey, once working
closely with Hitler's gas-maker I.G. Farben, now
controls 275 subsidiaries in 52 countries, has sales in
more than 100 countries, and derives 2/3 of its total
profits from its overseas business. The heads of
Standard and hundreds of its multinational brethren
will meet at the lIC to consolidate their control over
the resources, markets, and peoples of the Third
World. Men like this should not be permitted to
assemble anvwhere on the face of the earth.
