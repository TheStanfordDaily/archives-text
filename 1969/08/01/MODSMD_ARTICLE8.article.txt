## A 						New Modest Proposal 
### Stephen Baird 
Today politicians are discussing "national
priorities." This means that they are arguing about
how to spend our money. For example, Spiro
Agnew wants to go to Mars, Jesse Unruh wants to
spend money on education, and Ronald Reagan
wants to give it back to the property owners, to
discourage poverty by rewarding prosperity.
Nowhere though, do our leaders come closer to
war than when they fight over defense. The generals
and the President feel that, to prevent attack, we
must be able to kill a certain large number of people
anywhere in the world on short notice. To do this,
Edward Teller invented the hydrogen bomb and
Werhner von Braun built rockets to carry it, so that
the generals could easily send it from place to place.
When the communists did the same thing, the
President proposed building an anti ballistic missile
system, to make sure we would have a few rockets
left after the communists destroyed our cities.
Congress is arguing about this now.

It will be very expensive and complicated. In
order for the ABM to work properly, radar and
computers must be coordinated to decide whether
incoming missiles are headed for cities, and can be
ignored, or whether they are headed for our own
missiles, and must be shot down. Scientists say this
cannot now be done; other people still don't
understand why it should be done.
During the ABM debate another part of our arms
program has also been under attack. The National
Association for the Advancement of Science, the
students, the Japanese, and other interest groups
have been harassing the generals about the
chemical-biological warfare agents they have
deployed for our defense.
The Japanese want us to remove our nerve gas
from Okinawa, the scientists don't want us to ship
any out of Denver, and the students don't want us
to have any at all. Those making these conflicting
demands must not care about the facts.

Bacteria and viruses, although they require some
time for distribution and incubation, can kill just as
many people as hydrogen bombs can. While one
must admit that atomic explosions thunder and
flash impressively, this advantage may be cancelled
by the cost of keeping so many scientists,
technicians, and (perhaps) other missiles around to
maintain and protect them.

Consider the case for bacteria and viruses. They
grow perfectly in ordinary polluted water. Some are
so toxic that a five cc syringe like the average
diabetic or dope addict carries around will hold
enough to wipe out everyone in Los Angeles. (Any
cost effectiveness analyst would be pleased by this.)
And further, while a bomb destroys everything, a
dose of germs in the L.A. water supply would kill
only people and pets, leaving all the machines and
capital goods intact to provide jobs for the poor.
Some forward-looking policy makers have
suggested that we develop such a new defense
program now, but foot draggers still favor the
bomb. I feel strongly that, in this era of tight
money, we cannot afford to do otherwise. We must
rely on biological agents for defense and dismantle
our nuclear weapons.
Our real kill potential would not be reduced; our
balance of terror would remain the same; and the
bombs could be converted to pollution free power
sources for industry. The savings to our economy
would be enormous and could be used to finance
one last needed defense project.
As we know, scientists can now select certain
bacteria and viruses to grow in one inbred strain of
animal and not in others. This has enormous
potential. As we learn to genetically distinguish
between Americans, Chinese, communists, students,
Negroes, poor people, convicts, and other threats to
the American Way of Life, we will be able to select
for toxic organisms as needed, and defend ourselves
against any enemy that arises. Once such a program
is completed, our leaders will have no more worries.
