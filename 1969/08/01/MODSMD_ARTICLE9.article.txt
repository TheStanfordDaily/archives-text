• Stanford Land
To I'lii' Ktlilor;
There have born several factual
errors in recent Daily articles
describing development of
Stanford lands. The following
information will help to correct,
the record;
1. Continuation of the existing
research and light manufacturing
development in the vicinity of
Coyote Hill has been public
knowledge since 1960 when the
property was first zoned and
annexed. A number of leases have
been made since 1960. Stanford
and Palo Alto have jointly
planned for the development of
the two new roads which serve the
remaining property.
2. The site proposed for a
financial center and hotel at the
intersection of Page Mill and El
Camino Real is twenty (20) acres.
George S. Nolte, Consulting Civil
Engineers, Inc. project that the
center will not generate more
traffic than if the property were
developed according to existing
zoning. Stanford did not request

the wrong zone change for the
site. The original zoning
application was amended to
conform to the wishes of the Palo
Alto Planning Commission.
3. The Old Corporation Yard
site is presently under long-term
lease to Palo Alto. The University
has consistently recommended
that the site be investigated for
low income housing. The final
decision rests exclusively with
Palo Alto.
• Who Runs Stanford?
To The Kriilor:
I'm tired of hearing that
Stanford is controlled by those
whose interests lie elsewhere. It's
not. It's controlled by people
right here who slave their guts out
on three or four hours sleep a
night trying to make the right
decisions. The more you keep
insisting that some other "power
elite" controls the University, the
more likely it is to happen. Then
we'll all have real reason to yell.
