## Ford To Stanford 
### MARK WEINBERGER 
Arjay Miller appears perfectly at
home in his spacious, carpeted
office on the second floor of the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business. It looks something like
what one would imagine as the
office of the president of Ford
Motor Company.
Miller dresses, talks and acts like
a business executive. As his mouth
moves, one can easily imagine the
words flowing forth on topics such
as profit margins, production
schedules, and market research.
But Arjay Miller is talking about
other things. He's taken on the
mantle of academic leadership,
serving as dean of the Stanford
Business School. The new dean
took over his duties July 1 upon
the retirement last year of Ernest
C. Arbuckle.
Miller speaks convincingly and
with considerable pride about his
work in bridging the gap between
business, government, and social
reform. He's a liberal, with a true
liberal's dedication to optimism.
Ghetto Work
The 53-year-old dean speaks
enthusiastically of his work in the
Detroit ghetto and as chairman of
Washington Urban Institute think
tank. Undoubtedly, he has an
impressive background in applying
business techniques to urban
problems, and has promised to
train business students for just this
type of work.
He's definitely eager to fit into
the academic mold. Although an
employee of Ford for 23 years and
president of the company for five,
he never mentions his management
of Ford business, his wide-flung
connections, nor the power
struggle that ultimately saw him
forced out of the Ford hierarchy.
Now, he's talking about the
limitations of the business role in
national problem-solving, the
training of urban experts with
administrative capabilities, and the
ramifications of student unrest on
the university community.
Miller is at his strongest
discussing this country's urban ills,
and setting up models for solution.
Thus far, he's been far more
subdued when discussing the
business school he will direct in the
years ahead. He is new to the
academic world, and is wary of
setting out bold plans for the
future.
Strengthen School
Indications are that Miller will
attempt to further strengthen the
Biz School rather than
revolutionize it. He supports Dean
Arbuckle's efforts to train
managers of private industry, and
will attempt to extend that
competence to public
administration as well. The school
is beginning a required course this
fall that ties business techniques to
the problems of the environment.
Miller needs to do most of his
homework on foreign issues. He
defended the overseas
development of business by Ford
and other American industries
overseas in a recent interview. "We
at Ford were bringing capital and
know how for use in the
inhabitant's best interests. We were
trying desperately to find out their
needs and interests.
"We didn't want dividends or a
permanent overseas interests: one
objective is to have nationals
completely run our overseas
operations," he added. Relations

with other countries, Miller said,
are "symbiotic."
It is apparent from talking with
him that Miller spent little of his
time worrying about Ford's
overseas investments. Now that he
will often be called upon to discuss
the role of business in American
overseas intervention, Miller could
profitably spend time considering
the implications of foreign
investment in underdeveloped
countries with dictatorial
leadership.
Peru Project
In a similar manner, Miller said
the Stanford business school which
was started in Peru exists "to train
good managers and leaders in the
public as well as the private
concerns. Our plan is not to train a
business elite." Miller has faith that
"management is neutral," which is
a debatable point on a college
campus.
Nevertheless, Miller is anxious
to direct top-rank business school
into a socially conscious
management school. And in that he
has a good chance for success.
Anxious to speak out on
contemporary issues now that he is
liberated from the confines of the
corporate world, Miller observed
that it is ridiculous for any one
segment of society to claim that it
can solve the country's problems.
Even though a top name in the
business establishment, he insists
that "it should be made clear to the
American people that business
cannot and should not attempt to
solve all of our present social ills.
Much more can be done than we
are now doing, but it is not
reasonable to expect business to do
everything than it is to expect
government to do everything."
Man on the Move
Miller is a man on the move,
reflecting the relentless activity
that put him near the top at Ford.
He has put into practice his
conviction that an
inter-disciplinary approach,
utilizing a cross-section of skills
available is the best approach to the
crises faced by American cities.
The product of that approach is
the Urban Institute of Washington,
D.C., of which Miller is chairman.
The institute is an independent
agency to serve as the federal
government's center for research
on urban problems. It was founded
by President Johnson as a "think
tank" under Miller'sdirection.
The Institute plans to make
studies and recommendations to
governmental agencies on
proposed programs and the success
of old ones. Factors such as
transportation, ecology, pollution,
housing, and others will be brought
into the picture, Miller explains.
Miller is already firmly
implanted in a new home in the
faculty housing area, and is
meeting frequently with Business
School faculty and students, Two
Continentals and a Ford LTD are
often seen in front of his new
home.
Feeling At Home
Miller has even begun to say
"we" in reference to Stanford,
rather than the world wide
corporation that he joined in 1946.
After accepting the deanship a year
ago, he decided to remain at Ford
an extra year in order to smooth his
personal transition.
Even though he is a conspicuous
symbol of corporate power and
leadership in the business

establishment, Miller expects no
protest from campus radicals in the
fall.
"I hope we can capitalize on
unrest in society and use this for a
reexamination of where we are and
where we ought to go. I hope we
can meet in honest dialogue."
A former economist for Robert
McNamara at the Department of
Defense, who knew Miller briefly
at the University of Chicago, had a
piece of advice to offer recently to
those dismayed at Miller's
appointment to the deanship:

"You radical students are
attacking Miller on the wrong

educational complex, you should
point out that he was a failure on
his own terms. When Ford needed a

Motors over Miller who was the

sought a new job—being dean at

Miller clings mightily to a
liberal's notion that dialogue will
result in tangible results for action.
He has proposed a National Goals
Institute that would develop a
consensus about the country s
goals, followed by a systematic
approach to meeting them by way
of media such as the Urban
Institute.
Miller's overriding social
concern is seeping its way into his
vision of what Stanford's Business
School should be. Although he has
no snecific programs in mind as

aspect of the business student's
education. What he terms the
"people part" is becoming
increasingly important.
"Leaders in both the private and
public sectors will need broader
■ vision," he said, in order to bring
the human factor to bear on
business and governmental
decisions.
Respond Effectively
"As the world gets larger, we
impinge on each other. We need to
respond effectively in the public
sector, doing as effective a job in
the public domain as is already
being done in the private domain of
goods production."
The Business School will
continue its current trend of
increased training in behaviorial
sciences to implement
technological training. Miller said
that understanding people and
their relations to organizations is
essential for modern
administrators.
"The school has made a hell of a
lot of progress. I want to continue
this trend, looking at management
as a general skill applicable to the
public as well as the private
sector," Miller commented.
Miller wants managerial
techniques currently used by
American corporations extended
to wrestle with many of the
monumental problems he sees
plaguing this country and the
world.
In sum, Miller feels that
"management is neutral. There is a
need for managers no matter what
kind of society you have, unless
you are an anarchist."

need for managers no matter what
kind of society you have, unless
you are an anarchist."
Arjay Miller appears perfectly at
home in his spacious, carpeted
office on the second floor of the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business. It looks something like
what one would imagine as the
office of the president of Ford
Motor Company.
Miller dresses, talks and acts like
a business executive. As his mouth
moves, one can easily imagine the
words flowing forth on topics such
as profit margins, production
schedules, and market research.
But Arjay Miller is talking about
other things. He's taken on the
mantle of academic leadership,
serving as dean of the Stanford
Business School. The new dean
took over his duties July 1 upon
the retirement last year of Ernest
C. Arbuckle.
Miller speaks convincingly and
with considerable pride about his
work in bridging the gap between
business, government, and social
reform. He's a liberal, with a true
liberal's dedication to optimism.
Ghetto Work
The 53-year-old dean speaks
enthusiastically of his work in the
Detroit ghetto and as chairman of
Washington Urban Institute think
tank. Undoubtedly, he has an
impressive background in applying
business techniques to urban
problems, and has promised to
train business students for just this
type of work.
He's definitely eager to fit into
the academic mold. Although an
employee of Ford for 23 years and
president of the company for five,
he never mentions his management
of Ford business, his wide-flung
connections, nor the power
struggle that ultimately saw him
forced out of the Ford hierarchy.
Now, he's talking about the
limitations of the business role in
national problem-solving, the
training of urban experts with
administrative capabilities, and the
ramifications of student unrest on
the university community.
Miller is at his strongest
discussing this country's urban ills,
and setting up models for solution.
Thus far, he's been far more
subdued when discussing the
business school he will direct in the
years ahead. He is new to the
academic world, and is wary of
setting out bold plans for the
future.
Strengthen School
Indications are that Miller will
attempt to further strengthen the
Biz School rather than
revolutionize it. He supports Dean
Arbuckle's efforts to train
managers of private industry, and
will attempt to extend that
competence to public
administration as well. The school
is beginning a required course this
fall that ties business techniques to
the problems of the environment.
Miller needs to do most of his
homework on foreign issues. He
defended the overseas
development of business by Ford
and other American industries
overseas in a recent interview. "We
at Ford were bringing capital and
know how for use in the
inhabitant's best interests. We were
trying desperately to find out their
needs and interests.
"We didn't want dividends or a
permanent overseas interests: one
objective is to have nationals
completely run our overseas
operations," he added. Relations

with other countries, Miller said,
are "symbiotic."
It is apparent from talking with
him that Miller spent little of his
time worrying about Ford's
overseas investments. Now that he
will often be called upon to discuss
the role of business in American
overseas intervention, Miller could
profitably spend time considering
the implications of foreign
investment in underdeveloped
countries with dictatorial
leadership.
Peru Project
In a similar manner, Miller said
the Stanford business school which
was started in Peru exists "to train
good managers and leaders in the
public as well as the private
concerns. Our plan is not to train a
business elite." Miller has faith that
"management is neutral," which is
a debatable point on a college
campus.
Nevertheless, Miller is anxious
to direct top-rank business school
into a socially conscious
management school. And in that he
has a good chance for success.
Anxious to speak out on
contemporary issues now that he is
liberated from the confines of the
corporate world, Miller observed
that it is ridiculous for any one
segment of society to claim that it
can solve the country's problems.
Even though a top name in the
business establishment, he insists
that "it should be made clear to the
American people that business
cannot and should not attempt to
solve all of our present social ills.
Much more can be done than we
are now doing, but it is not
reasonable to expect business to do
everything than it is to expect
government to do everything."
Man on the Move
Miller is a man on the move,
reflecting the relentless activity
that put him near the top at Ford.
He has put into practice his
conviction that an
inter-disciplinary approach,
utilizing a cross-section of skills
available is the best approach to the
crises faced by American cities.
The product of that approach is
the Urban Institute of Washington,
D.C., of which Miller is chairman.
The institute is an independent
agency to serve as the federal
government's center for research
on urban problems. It was founded
by President Johnson as a "think
tank" under Miller'sdirection.
The Institute plans to make
studies and recommendations to
governmental agencies on
proposed programs and the success
of old ones. Factors such as
transportation, ecology, pollution,
housing, and others will be brought
into the picture, Miller explains.
Miller is already firmly
implanted in a new home in the
faculty housing area, and is
meeting frequently with Business
School faculty and students, Two
Continentals and a Ford LTD are
often seen in front of his new
home.
Feeling At Home
Miller has even begun to say
"we" in reference to Stanford,
rather than the world wide
corporation that he joined in 1946.
After accepting the deanship a year
ago, he decided to remain at Ford
an extra year in order to smooth his
personal transition.
Even though he is a conspicuous
symbol of corporate power and
leadership in the business

establishment, Miller expects no
protest from campus radicals in the
fall.
"I hope we can capitalize on
unrest in society and use this for a
reexamination of where we are and
where we ought to go. I hope we
can meet in honest dialogue."
A former economist for Robert
McNamara at the Department of
Defense, who knew Miller briefly
at the University of Chicago, had a
piece of advice to offer recently to
those dismayed at Miller's
appointment to the deanship:
Wrong Line of Attack
"You radical students are
attacking Miller on the wrong
grounds. Instead of criticizing his
role in the military-industrial
educational complex, you should
point out that he was a failure on
his own terms. When Ford needed a
new chief executive, they picked
the number two man at General
Motors over Miller who was the
number two at Ford. He then
sought a new job—being dean at
Stanford."
Miller clings mightily to a
liberal's notion that dialogue will
result in tangible results for action.
He has proposed a National Goals
Institute that would develop a
consensus about the country s
goals, followed by a systematic
approach to meeting them by way
of media such as the Urban
Institute.
Miller's overriding social
concern is seeping its way into his
vision of what Stanford's Business
School should be. Although he has
no snecific programs in mind as

aspect of the business student's
education. What he terms the
"people part" is becoming
increasingly important.
"Leaders in both the private and
public sectors will need broader
■ vision," he said, in order to bring
the human factor to bear on
business and governmental
decisions.
Respond Effectively
"As the world gets larger, we
impinge on each other. We need to
respond effectively in the public
sector, doing as effective a job in
the public domain as is already
being done in the private domain of
goods production."
The Business School will
continue its current trend of
increased training in behaviorial
sciences to implement
technological training. Miller said
that understanding people and
their relations to organizations is
essential for modern
administrators.
"The school has made a hell of a
lot of progress. I want to continue
this trend, looking at management
as a general skill applicable to the
public as well as the private
sector," Miller commented.
Miller wants managerial
techniques currently used by
American corporations extended
to wrestle with many of the
monumental problems he sees
plaguing this country and the
world.
In sum, Miller feels that
"management is neutral. There is a
need for managers no matter what
kind of society you have, unless
you are an anarchist."

piece of advice to offer recently to
those dismayed at Miller's
appointment to the deanship:
Wrong Line of Attack
"You radical students are
attacking Miller on the wrong
grounds. Instead of criticizing his
role in the military-industrial
educational complex, you should
point out that he was a failure on
his own terms. When Ford needed a
new chief executive, they picked
the number two man at General
Motors over Miller who was the
number two at Ford. He then
sought a new job—being dean at
Stanford."
Miller clings mightily to a
liberal's notion that dialogue will
result in tangible results for action.
He has proposed a National Goals
Institute that would develop a
consensus about the country s
goals, followed by a systematic
approach to meeting them by way
of media such as the Urban
Institute.
Miller's overriding social
concern is seeping its way into his
vision of what Stanford's Business
School should be. Although he has
no snecific programs in mind as

aspect of the business student's
education. What he terms the
"people part" is becoming
increasingly important.
"Leaders in both the private and
public sectors will need broader
■ vision," he said, in order to bring
the human factor to bear on
business and governmental
decisions.
Respond Effectively
"As the world gets larger, we
impinge on each other. We need to
respond effectively in the public
sector, doing as effective a job in
the public domain as is already
being done in the private domain of
goods production."
The Business School will
continue its current trend of
increased training in behaviorial
sciences to implement
technological training. Miller said
that understanding people and
their relations to organizations is
essential for modern
administrators.
"The school has made a hell of a
lot of progress. I want to continue
this trend, looking at management
as a general skill applicable to the
public as well as the private
sector," Miller commented.
Miller wants managerial
techniques currently used by
American corporations extended
to wrestle with many of the
monumental problems he sees
plaguing this country and the
world.
In sum, Miller feels that
"management is neutral. There is a
need for managers no matter what
kind of society you have, unless
you are an anarchist."
Arjay Miller appears perfectly at
home in his spacious, carpeted
office on the second floor of the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business. It looks something like
what one would imagine as the
office of the president of Ford
Motor Company.
Miller dresses, talks and acts like
a business executive. As his mouth
moves, one can easily imagine the
words flowing forth on topics such
as profit margins, production
schedules, and market research.
But Arjay Miller is talking about
other things. He's taken on the
mantle of academic leadership,
serving as dean of the Stanford
Business School. The new dean
took over his duties July 1 upon
the retirement last year of Ernest
C. Arbuckle.
Miller speaks convincingly and
with considerable pride about his
work in bridging the gap between
business, government, and social
reform. He's a liberal, with a true
liberal's dedication to optimism.
Ghetto Work
The 53-year-old dean speaks
enthusiastically of his work in the
Detroit ghetto and as chairman of
Washington Urban Institute think
tank. Undoubtedly, he has an
impressive background in applying
business techniques to urban
problems, and has promised to
train business students for just this
type of work.
He's definitely eager to fit into
the academic mold. Although an
employee of Ford for 23 years and
president of the company for five,
he never mentions his management
of Ford business, his wide-flung
connections, nor the power
struggle that ultimately saw him
forced out of the Ford hierarchy.
Now, he's talking about the
limitations of the business role in
national problem-solving, the
training of urban experts with
administrative capabilities, and the
ramifications of student unrest on
the university community.
Miller is at his strongest
discussing this country's urban ills,
and setting up models for solution.
Thus far, he's been far more
subdued when discussing the
business school he will direct in the
years ahead. He is new to the
academic world, and is wary of
setting out bold plans for the
future.
Strengthen School
Indications are that Miller will
attempt to further strengthen the
Biz School rather than
revolutionize it. He supports Dean
Arbuckle's efforts to train
managers of private industry, and
will attempt to extend that
competence to public
administration as well. The school
is beginning a required course this
fall that ties business techniques to
the problems of the environment.
Miller needs to do most of his
homework on foreign issues. He
defended the overseas
development of business by Ford
and other American industries
overseas in a recent interview. "We
at Ford were bringing capital and
know how for use in the
inhabitant's best interests. We were
trying desperately to find out their
needs and interests.
"We didn't want dividends or a
permanent overseas interests: one
objective is to have nationals
completely run our overseas
operations," he added. Relations

with other countries, Miller said,
are "symbiotic."
It is apparent from talking with
him that Miller spent little of his
time worrying about Ford's
overseas investments. Now that he
will often be called upon to discuss
the role of business in American
overseas intervention, Miller could
profitably spend time considering
the implications of foreign
investment in underdeveloped
countries with dictatorial
leadership.
Peru Project
In a similar manner, Miller said
the Stanford business school which
was started in Peru exists "to train
good managers and leaders in the
public as well as the private
concerns. Our plan is not to train a
business elite." Miller has faith that
"management is neutral," which is
a debatable point on a college
campus.
Nevertheless, Miller is anxious
to direct top-rank business school
into a socially conscious
management school. And in that he
has a good chance for success.
Anxious to speak out on
contemporary issues now that he is
liberated from the confines of the
corporate world, Miller observed
that it is ridiculous for any one
segment of society to claim that it
can solve the country's problems.
Even though a top name in the
business establishment, he insists
that "it should be made clear to the
American people that business
cannot and should not attempt to
solve all of our present social ills.
Much more can be done than we
are now doing, but it is not
reasonable to expect business to do
everything than it is to expect
government to do everything."
Man on the Move
Miller is a man on the move,
reflecting the relentless activity
that put him near the top at Ford.
He has put into practice his
conviction that an
inter-disciplinary approach,
utilizing a cross-section of skills
available is the best approach to the
crises faced by American cities.
The product of that approach is
the Urban Institute of Washington,
D.C., of which Miller is chairman.
The institute is an independent
agency to serve as the federal
government's center for research
on urban problems. It was founded
by President Johnson as a "think
tank" under Miller'sdirection.
The Institute plans to make
studies and recommendations to
governmental agencies on
proposed programs and the success
of old ones. Factors such as
transportation, ecology, pollution,
housing, and others will be brought
into the picture, Miller explains.
Miller is already firmly
implanted in a new home in the
faculty housing area, and is
meeting frequently with Business
School faculty and students, Two
Continentals and a Ford LTD are
often seen in front of his new
home.
Feeling At Home
Miller has even begun to say
"we" in reference to Stanford,
rather than the world wide
corporation that he joined in 1946.
After accepting the deanship a year
ago, he decided to remain at Ford
an extra year in order to smooth his
personal transition.
Even though he is a conspicuous
symbol of corporate power and
leadership in the business

establishment, Miller expects no
protest from campus radicals in the
fall.
"I hope we can capitalize on
unrest in society and use this for a
reexamination of where we are and
where we ought to go. I hope we
can meet in honest dialogue."
A former economist for Robert
McNamara at the Department of
Defense, who knew Miller briefly
at the University of Chicago, had a
piece of advice to offer recently to

Even though a top name in the
business establishment, he insists
that "it should be made clear to the
American people that business
cannot and should not attempt to
solve all of our present social ills.
Much more can be done than we
are now doing, but it is not
reasonable to expect business to do
everything than it is to expect
government to do everything."
Man on the Move
Miller is a man on the move,
reflecting the relentless activity
that put him near the top at Ford.
He has put into practice his
conviction that an
inter-disciplinary approach,
utilizing a cross-section of skills
available is the best approach to the
crises faced by American cities.
The product of that approach is
the Urban Institute of Washington,
D.C., of which Miller is chairman.
The institute is an independent
agency to serve as the federal
government's center for research
on urban problems. It was founded
by President Johnson as a "think
tank" under Miller'sdirection.
The Institute plans to make
studies and recommendations to
governmental agencies on
proposed programs and the success
of old ones. Factors such as
transportation, ecology, pollution,
housing, and others will be brought
into the picture, Miller explains.
Miller is already firmly
implanted in a new home in the
faculty housing area, and is
meeting frequently with Business
School faculty and students, Two
Continentals and a Ford LTD are
often seen in front of his new
home.
Feeling At Home
Miller has even begun to say
"we" in reference to Stanford,
rather than the world wide
corporation that he joined in 1946.
After accepting the deanship a year
ago, he decided to remain at Ford
an extra year in order to smooth his
personal transition.
Even though he is a conspicuous
symbol of corporate power and
leadership in the business

establishment, Miller expects no
protest from campus radicals in the
fall.
"I hope we can capitalize on
unrest in society and use this for a
reexamination of where we are and
where we ought to go. I hope we
can meet in honest dialogue."
A former economist for Robert
McNamara at the Department of
Defense, who knew Miller briefly
at the University of Chicago, had a
piece of advice to offer recently to
those dismayed at Miller's
appointment to the deanship:
Wrong Line of Attack
"You radical students are
attacking Miller on the wrong
grounds. Instead of criticizing his
role in the military-industrial
educational complex, you should
point out that he was a failure on
his own terms. When Ford needed a
new chief executive, they picked
the number two man at General
Motors over Miller who was the
number two at Ford. He then
sought a new job—being dean at
Stanford."
Miller clings mightily to a
liberal's notion that dialogue will
result in tangible results for action.
He has proposed a National Goals
Institute that would develop a
consensus about the country s
goals, followed by a systematic
approach to meeting them by way
of media such as the Urban
Institute.
Miller's overriding social
concern is seeping its way into his
vision of what Stanford's Business
School should be. Although he has
no snecific programs in mind as

aspect of the business student's
education. What he terms the
"people part" is becoming
increasingly important.
"Leaders in both the private and
public sectors will need broader
■ vision," he said, in order to bring
the human factor to bear on
business and governmental
decisions.
Respond Effectively
"As the world gets larger, we
impinge on each other. We need to
respond effectively in the public
sector, doing as effective a job in
the public domain as is already
being done in the private domain of
goods production."
The Business School will
continue its current trend of
increased training in behaviorial
sciences to implement
technological training. Miller said
that understanding people and
their relations to organizations is
essential for modern
administrators.
"The school has made a hell of a
lot of progress. I want to continue
this trend, looking at management
as a general skill applicable to the
public as well as the private
sector," Miller commented.
Miller wants managerial
techniques currently used by
American corporations extended
to wrestle with many of the
monumental problems he sees
plaguing this country and the
world.
In sum, Miller feels that
"management is neutral. There is a
need for managers no matter what
kind of society you have, unless
you are an anarchist."
Arjay Miller appears perfectly at
home in his spacious, carpeted
office on the second floor of the
Stanford Graduate School of
Business. It looks something like
what one would imagine as the
office of the president of Ford
Motor Company.
Miller dresses, talks and acts like
a business executive. As his mouth
moves, one can easily imagine the
words flowing forth on topics such
as profit margins, production
schedules, and market research.
But Arjay Miller is talking about
other things. He's taken on the
mantle of academic leadership,
serving as dean of the Stanford
Business School. The new dean
took over his duties July 1 upon
the retirement last year of Ernest
C. Arbuckle.
Miller speaks convincingly and
with considerable pride about his
work in bridging the gap between
business, government, and social
reform. He's a liberal, with a true
liberal's dedication to optimism.
Ghetto Work
The 53-year-old dean speaks
enthusiastically of his work in the
Detroit ghetto and as chairman of
Washington Urban Institute think
tank. Undoubtedly, he has an
impressive background in applying
business techniques to urban
problems, and has promised to
train business students for just this
type of work.
He's definitely eager to fit into
the academic mold. Although an
employee of Ford for 23 years and
president of the company for five,
he never mentions his management
of Ford business, his wide-flung
connections, nor the power
struggle that ultimately saw him
forced out of the Ford hierarchy.
Now, he's talking about the
limitations of the business role in
national problem-solving, the
training of urban experts with
administrative capabilities, and the
ramifications of student unrest on
the university community.
Miller is at his strongest
discussing this country's urban ills,
and setting up models for solution.
Thus far, he's been far more
subdued when discussing the
business school he will direct in the
years ahead. He is new to the
academic world, and is wary of
setting out bold plans for the
future.
Strengthen School
Indications are that Miller will
attempt to further strengthen the
Biz School rather than
revolutionize it. He supports Dean
Arbuckle's efforts to train
managers of private industry, and
will attempt to extend that
competence to public
administration as well. The school
is beginning a required course this
fall that ties business techniques to
the problems of the environment.
Miller needs to do most of his
homework on foreign issues. He
defended the overseas
development of business by Ford
and other American industries
overseas in a recent interview. "We
at Ford were bringing capital and
know how for use in the
inhabitant's best interests. We were
trying desperately to find out their
needs and interests.
"We didn't want dividends or a
permanent overseas interests: one
objective is to have nationals
completely run our overseas
operations," he added. Relations

with other countries, Miller said,
are "symbiotic."
It is apparent from talking with
him that Miller spent little of his
time worrying about Ford's
overseas investments. Now that he
will often be called upon to discuss
the role of business in American
overseas intervention, Miller could
profitably spend time considering
the implications of foreign
investment in underdeveloped
countries with dictatorial
leadership.
Peru Project
In a similar manner, Miller said
the Stanford business school which
was started in Peru exists "to train
good managers and leaders in the
public as well as the private
concerns. Our plan is not to train a
business elite." Miller has faith that
"management is neutral," which is
a debatable point on a college
campus.
Nevertheless, Miller is anxious
to direct top-rank business school
into a socially conscious
management school. And in that he
has a good chance for success.
Anxious to speak out on
contemporary issues now that he is
liberated from the confines of the
corporate world, Miller observed
that it is ridiculous for any one
segment of society to claim that it
can solve the country's problems.
Even though a top name in the
business establishment, he insists
that "it should be made clear to the
American people that business
cannot and should not attempt to
solve all of our present social ills.
Much more can be done than we
are now doing, but it is not
reasonable to expect business to do
everything than it is to expect
