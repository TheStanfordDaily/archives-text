### 
The Department of Civil
Engineering will sponsor a
discussion of the problems of
low-cost housing Thursday. The
meeting will be at 2:15 p.m. in
room 370 (Outer Quad, facing the
Physics Tank).
The Department of Housing and
Urban Development recently
invited proposals from universities
for research on factors associated
with the mass-production of
low-cost housing.
In response to this, the Civil
Engineering Department has
organized this meeting to develop
an interdisciplinary approach to
the problem —in solving
technological, financial,
architectural, legal, sociological,
and other problems. All faculty
intertested are urged to attend.
