# Harris Transferred After Hunger Strike
## 
### 
Former Stanford student body
president Dave Harris was
transferred yesterday from the San
Francisco County Jail to the
Alameda County Jail in downtown
Oakland after he participated in a
hunger strike protesting prisoner
grievances in the San Francisco jail.
Harris is at present awaiting
eventual transfer to Stafford
Federal Prison camp in
southeastern Arizona, where he
will serve a three-year sentence for
refusing to be inducted into the
Army.
On Sunday, a demonstration by
about 40 people, many of whom
were affiliated with the Institute
for the Study of Non-Violence in
Palo Alto was staged outside the
San Francisco jail in support of the
federal prisoners' hunger strike.
Conditions in the prison that led
to the strike were described in a
letter by Harris which was
smuggled out by one of his
attorneys Friday.
The demands which the
prisoners were making were (1)
better medical care, (2) better
food, (3) restoration of visiting
hours, and (4) provision of
television for the prisoners.
Stewart Burns of the Institute

for the Study of Non-violence told
The Daily yesterday, "We at the
Institute didn't want the
demonstration to be merely for
improved prison conditions: better
food, better medical care, etc. We
wanted it to challenge the whole
idea of a prison system. Prisons
don't have a right to exist. In
prisons, as Dave said in his letter,
'you see the logical conclusion of
American society."
The text of the smuggled letter,
dated August 1, reads as follows:
I'm on a block with the rest of the
federal prisoners. We live in an B'x2o'
tank cell with bars across the front.
There are eight prisoners to each cell, six
sleep on bunks, the other two on
matresses on the floor.
"We get out of the cell once during
the week for a shower and twice a week
for visits. There's a toilet bowl in the
corner next to a sink. We each have two
blankets which can't quite hold up to
cold San Francisco nights. Four of the
prisoners in my cell have colds, for
which they get two aspirins.
"The food is handed in through the
bars: watery oatmeal, greasy soup, and
macaroni with lots of pepper. Most of us
live off comissary privileges:
Langcndorf cupcakes, candy bars, and
milk (we get bitter coffee with meals).
"I've been in seventeen days and have
lost seven pounds. One of us in the cell
has been here for 137 days and has lost
close to forty pounds.
"Lights are turned out at 9:00. If you
stay up late, you can hear the guards
beating on the prisoners in the hole; the
hole is about s'x7' with rubber walls and
a floor and a hole in the middle of the
floor that backs sewage into the cell.
"When the grand jury came through,
the jail officials put down a new floor;
because they couldn't wash out the
blood stains. There is someone in the
hole now who screams all night long.
"Medical attention is handled by an
old man who toddles in twice a week.
Fortunately, no one has died yet. But an
incident that happened the other night
is exemplary of the treatment. A man in
our cell was (and still is) sick with some
kind of lung infection. He wascoughing
blood. He could hardly breathe, so we
called the guard. He took the man's
name and left. He didn't come back for
45 minutes, so we made so much noise
that they came back and took him out.
"They carried him down toa holding
cell, laid him on the concrete floor and
gave him sleeping pills. At 6:00 in the
morning, they brought him back; since
then all the doctor has prescribed is
sleeping pills. He still coughs blood.
"That same night, the entire block
had its visitinq privileges suspended by a
temporary deputy for talking after the
lights were out.
"The entire cell block has been on a
hunger strike for the last day demanding
that our visiting privileges be reinstated
and that prisoners be given proper
medical attention. No one has eaten or
will eat until a satisfactory answer is
given by the Sheriff.
"In here, you see the logical
conclusion of American society. It's not
really different in kind, just in
quantity."

federal prisoners. We live in an B'x2o'
tank cell with bars across the front.
There are eight prisoners to each cell, six
sleep on bunks, the other two on
matresses on the floor.
"We get out of the cell once during
the week for a shower and twice a week
for visits. There's a toilet bowl in the
corner next to a sink. We each have two
blankets which can't quite hold up to
cold San Francisco nights. Four of the
prisoners in my cell have colds, for
which they get two aspirins.
"The food is handed in through the
bars: watery oatmeal, greasy soup, and
macaroni with lots of pepper. Most of us
live off comissary privileges:
Langcndorf cupcakes, candy bars, and
milk (we get bitter coffee with meals).
"I've been in seventeen days and have
lost seven pounds. One of us in the cell
has been here for 137 days and has lost
close to forty pounds.
"Lights are turned out at 9:00. If you
stay up late, you can hear the guards
beating on the prisoners in the hole; the
hole is about s'x7' with rubber walls and
a floor and a hole in the middle of the
floor that backs sewage into the cell.
"When the grand jury came through,
the jail officials put down a new floor;
because they couldn't wash out the
blood stains. There is someone in the
hole now who screams all night long.
"Medical attention is handled by an
old man who toddles in twice a week.
Fortunately, no one has died yet. But an
incident that happened the other night
is exemplary of the treatment. A man in
our cell was (and still is) sick with some
kind of lung infection. He wascoughing
blood. He could hardly breathe, so we
called the guard. He took the man's
name and left. He didn't come back for
45 minutes, so we made so much noise
that they came back and took him out.
"They carried him down toa holding
cell, laid him on the concrete floor and
gave him sleeping pills. At 6:00 in the
morning, they brought him back; since
then all the doctor has prescribed is
sleeping pills. He still coughs blood.
"That same night, the entire block
had its visitinq privileges suspended by a
temporary deputy for talking after the
lights were out.
"The entire cell block has been on a
hunger strike for the last day demanding
that our visiting privileges be reinstated
and that prisoners be given proper
medical attention. No one has eaten or
will eat until a satisfactory answer is
given by the Sheriff.
"In here, you see the logical
conclusion of American society. It's not
really different in kind, just in
quantity."
Former Stanford student body
president Dave Harris was
transferred yesterday from the San
Francisco County Jail to the
Alameda County Jail in downtown
Oakland after he participated in a
hunger strike protesting prisoner
grievances in the San Francisco jail.
Harris is at present awaiting
eventual transfer to Stafford
Federal Prison camp in
southeastern Arizona, where he
will serve a three-year sentence for
refusing to be inducted into the
Army.
On Sunday, a demonstration by
about 40 people, many of whom
were affiliated with the Institute
for the Study of Non-Violence in
Palo Alto was staged outside the
San Francisco jail in support of the
federal prisoners' hunger strike.
Conditions in the prison that led
to the strike were described in a
letter by Harris which was
smuggled out by one of his
attorneys Friday.
The demands which the
prisoners were making were (1)
better medical care, (2) better
food, (3) restoration of visiting
hours, and (4) provision of
television for the prisoners.
Stewart Burns of the Institute

for the Study of Non-violence told
The Daily yesterday, "We at the
Institute didn't want the
demonstration to be merely for
improved prison conditions: better
food, better medical care, etc. We
wanted it to challenge the whole
idea of a prison system. Prisons
don't have a right to exist. In
prisons, as Dave said in his letter,
'you see the logical conclusion of
American society."
The text of the smuggled letter,
dated August 1, reads as follows:
