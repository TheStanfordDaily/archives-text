Florence Moore Hall, at present
the only Stanford dormitory
complex which is completely
inhabited by women, may have a
couple of its seven houses filled
with males by September.
Bill Leland, the new Associate
Dean of Students emphasized in
talking to The Daily that matters
were still in the process of being
worked out. He said, "There is a
reasonable chance to effect a
change in Florence Moore by the
fall.
Another Associate Dean of
Students, Sally Mahoney, recalled
yesterday that altering the
all-female status of Florence Moore
had been a "serious problem"
considered in the Dean's office off
and on throughout the past
academic year. The residence
system changes which were
implemented during the past
academic year had to be "planned
arou an all-female Florence
Moore.
Also pushing for putting men in
Florence Moore were dormitory
sponsors Eric Larson, Caroline
Bixby, and Roger Boesche, who
began working on the problem in
January 1969.
The major consideration in
changing Florence Moore Hall into
a co-educational dormitory has
been the terms of Florence Moore's
1955 gift to the University. The
widow of the founder of the Moore
Dry Dock Company gave her
money, at the University's request,
for a women's residence.
In 1966 a student proposal for
co-educational living in Stern and
Florence Moore was turned down
by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education. The
Daily of March 6, 1966, said:
"According to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education Robert
Hind, 'in view of the
insurmountable legal obstacles of
co-ed arrangements at this time,
the project could not be
recommended.' . . .A court ruling
is necessary before Moore can
legally be used by men's housing."
This year the Dean's office went
back through Mrs. Moore's
correspondence with Stanford to
try to determine her intentions in
giving the money. Had she
intended her gift to provide
housing only for women?
They decided after examining
the correspondence that Mrs.
Moore had not cared that much
one way or the other. But that her
intention had been to provide
appropriate, good housing for
women.
The Dean's office contends that
in the context of present-day
Stanford, making Florence Moore
Hall co-educational would improve
the housing provided for women, if
this could be done v. r«»ut
reducing the total amount of
on-campus housing available to
women.
During the housing draw last
spring, only about 30 women
outside of Florence Moore
requested Florence Moore as their
first choice.
One possible arrangement for
the University residence system, if
the Trustees approve co-education
for Florence Moore at their
September 9 meeting, would have
two houses of freshmen men in
Florence Moore, with a house of
freshmen women in between them.
Donner house in Stern Hall would
then be co-educational. Cedro in
Wilbur would have freshman
women. Arroyo would have
freshman men.
Larson, Miss Bixby, and
Boesche have been asking the Dean
of Students office to write
dissatisfied upperclassmen who
participated in last spring's draw,
offering them new alternatives in
light of a changed status for
Florence Moore.

reducing the total amount of
on-campus housing available to
women.
During the housing draw last
spring, only about 30 women
outside of Florence Moore
requested Florence Moore as their
first choice.
One possible arrangement for
the University residence system, if
the Trustees approve co-education
for Florence Moore at their
September 9 meeting, would have
two houses of freshmen men in
Florence Moore, with a house of
freshmen women in between them.
Donner house in Stern Hall would
then be co-educational. Cedro in
Wilbur would have freshman
women. Arroyo would have
freshman men.
Larson, Miss Bixby, and
Boesche have been asking the Dean
of Students office to write
dissatisfied upperclassmen who
participated in last spring's draw,
offering them new alternatives in
light of a changed status for
Florence Moore.
Florence Moore Hall, at present
the only Stanford dormitory
complex which is completely
inhabited by women, may have a
couple of its seven houses filled
with males by September.
Bill Leland, the new Associate
Dean of Students emphasized in
talking to The Daily that matters
were still in the process of being
worked out. He said, "There is a
reasonable chance to effect a
change in Florence Moore by the
fall.
Another Associate Dean of
Students, Sally Mahoney, recalled
yesterday that altering the
all-female status of Florence Moore
had been a "serious problem"
considered in the Dean's office off
and on throughout the past
academic year. The residence
system changes which were
implemented during the past
academic year had to be "planned
arou an all-female Florence
Moore.
Also pushing for putting men in
Florence Moore were dormitory
sponsors Eric Larson, Caroline
Bixby, and Roger Boesche, who
began working on the problem in
January 1969.
The major consideration in
changing Florence Moore Hall into
a co-educational dormitory has
been the terms of Florence Moore's
1955 gift to the University. The
widow of the founder of the Moore
Dry Dock Company gave her
money, at the University's request,
for a women's residence.
In 1966 a student proposal for
co-educational living in Stern and
Florence Moore was turned down
by the Committee on
Undergraduate Education. The
Daily of March 6, 1966, said:
"According to Associate Dean of
Undergraduate Education Robert
Hind, 'in view of the
insurmountable legal obstacles of
co-ed arrangements at this time,
the project could not be
recommended.' . . .A court ruling
is necessary before Moore can
legally be used by men's housing."
This year the Dean's office went
back through Mrs. Moore's
correspondence with Stanford to
try to determine her intentions in
giving the money. Had she
intended her gift to provide
housing only for women?
They decided after examining
the correspondence that Mrs.
Moore had not cared that much
one way or the other. But that her
intention had been to provide
appropriate, good housing for
women.
The Dean's office contends that
in the context of present-day
Stanford, making Florence Moore
Hall co-educational would improve
the housing provided for women, if
this could be done v. r«»ut
reducing the total amount of
on-campus housing available to
women.
