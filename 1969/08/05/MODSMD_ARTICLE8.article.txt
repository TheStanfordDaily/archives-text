# Sounds Like Summer
## Rock With Bach 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Now that demands and dialogue
and football have all failed to
bridge the "generation gap," some
people are urging music into the
challenger's box. Can we somehow
unite the music of the young folks
and the music of the other folks
into some form of Peoples' Music?
Rock we must take to be the
choice of the young world,
although it is certainly not a
universal choice. What do we
hypothesize for the over-30's?
Andre Kostelanetz, Palestrina or
Brahms?
Obviously, we do not have a
dichotomy. With music, the
question then becomes not one of
generation gap to be bridged, but
rather the differing musical tastes
of four billion souls. And I submit
that to make them all like the same
thing, to all desire some musical
minestrone, would be a crime
against humanity.
What, then, is the New York
Rock and Roll Ensemble trying to
do? Are they making an amalgam
of classical and rock music, for the
purpose of ethnic disintegration of
both? Having heard them in San
Jose last Friday with the San
Francisco Pops and again Sunday
with the New York Chamber
Soloists, it seems that they have
gotten the old long-hairs together
with the young ones for a jam
session, with some interesting
results.
Each style has benefited, and in
just the same way. Bach would
have enjoyed the concerts, had he
brought his earmuffs; he was a
creative and experimenting type,
and as I pointed out in an earlier
column, many of his innovations
have popped up again as
"modern."
The Ensemble's big new hit is
"The Brandenberg," a rock version
of Bach's Brandenberg Concerto
No. 5, first movement. Bach's
patron was cool towards it, but
present-day patrons (concert-goers
and record-buyers) are more
appreciative. The Ensemble has
used Bach's theme, many of his

variations and a few of his
phrasings in making an almost-rock
chart.
It is an exciting and intriguing
piece of work, very fine if taken
simply as a song, as a genuine
audience-pleaser. Of course, this is
not the first time such a dipping
into the past has produced
successful popular songs;
Tchaikowsky has been worth
millions to Tin Pan Alley, and Bach
himself was the inspiration for
"Lover's Concerto."
But the Ensemble did better,
because they do not attempt to
hide their sources, they can also
bring a bit of rock back to Bach,
which is exactly what they did with
the Chamber Soloists (an excellent
group, with a sense of humor
besides) on "A Whiter Shade of
Pale."
The modern theme was
translated into German and into
Baroque by an imaginative and
thoroughly knowledgable arranger
whose name I do not know.(He or
they may very well have been on
stage Sunday evening.) This is the
song a seventeenth century Procol
Harum would have sung.
The intervals, phrasing and
harmonies were Baroque, with the
familiar melody just recognizable.
Charles Bressler, the Soloists'
brilliant tenor, sang lead, while the
rest of the group played what
Johann might very well have
written.
Then the Ensemble took over,
with Martin Fulterman sighing the
melody on oboe, and Brian
Corrigan singing cartwheels across
the floor. The effect of juxtaposing
two styles of the same great song
made each interpretation sound
stronger.
It was the most creative musical
presentation I have had the
pleasure to experience in some
time, performed by two amazing
musical groups, united for the
purpose of showing the modern
world a bit of the genius of Bach,
the master of the Baroque world.
The Ensemble hits Stanford
again on August 9, and will be at
the Fillmore on August 19, 20 and
21. The Chamber Soloists, another
group well worth seeing, go it along
tonight and again August 8 at 8
p.m. in Mem Aud. They are both
faithful friends of music.
