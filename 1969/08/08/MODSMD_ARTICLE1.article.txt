# Stanford Stadium Gets Shrine Game
## 
### 
The East-West Shrine game has
gained a new home—the Stanford
Stadium. The annual match is a
collegiate all-star game, with
proceeds going to the San
Francisco Shriner's Hospital for
Crippled Children. This year the
game will be held here on
Saturday, December 27.
The game was played in Kezar
Stadium in San Francisco from
1927 to 1967 with the single
exception of the 1942 match
which was held in New Orleans.
Dissatisfaction with Kezar
resulted in a move to Candlestick
Park after rumors of a possible
move to the University of
California at Berkeley.
Kezar could seat about 60,000
but had abysmal parking facilities
while Candlestick Park could only
hold 45,000. By comparison
Stanford Stadium provides
accomodation for 87,000 and a
large amount of free parking.
The Stanford Stadium was
opened in 1921 and is still one of
the largest in the country. It was
used for the 1932 and 1960
Olympic Games trials and the
Soviet-U.S.A. track meet in 1962.
Because of Stanford's larger
capacity, it is expected that the
move will increase the Shrine's
monetary returns from the game.
Stanford will get only operating
expenses in addition to managing
the concessions.
The game will probably be a
sell-out, as it has been in past
years.
In explaining the move, Shrine
spokesman Francis Powers said,
"We can't take the risk of
counting on Candlestick this year.
They will be laying synthetic turf
in their renovation of Candlestick
and they'll probably be well into
the project about the time we'd
want to use the field. We can't
take the risk."
"The Shrine people are
tremendously happy about the
change," Powers added. "This is
the centennial of college football,
and it will be great to play the
45th renewal of the Shrine game
in a fine college stadium such as
Stanford."
The work out plans remain

uncharged from recent years. The
West team will use Stanford, and
the East will practice at the
University of Santa Clara.
The Palo Alto Times quoted
Stanford sports publicist Bob
Murphy as waxing ecstatic about
the move. "We at Stanford are
delighted to have the game here,"
he said.
"The playing surface is
absolutely great. Even when it's
wet, it's very playable. We have
double the press facilities they
had at Kezar, not to mention the
acres of free parking.
The move to Stanford has long
been advocated by the PALO
club, the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce, and Shriners in the
Midpeninsula.
University of Southern
California Coach John McKay,
who will coach the West in this
year's game was happy with the
switch. "It will be nice to have the
advantage of playing on a college
field."
McKay would have to
relinquish his position as coach
for the Shrine team if the USC
team goes to the Rose Bowl.
However, in the unlikely situation
where Stanford would be going to
the Rose Bowl, two teams would
share the training facilities. It is
expected that there would be no
problem.

tremendously happy about the
change," Powers added. "This is
the centennial of college football,
and it will be great to play the
45th renewal of the Shrine game
in a fine college stadium such as
Stanford."
The work out plans remain

uncharged from recent years. The
West team will use Stanford, and
the East will practice at the
University of Santa Clara.
The Palo Alto Times quoted
Stanford sports publicist Bob
Murphy as waxing ecstatic about
the move. "We at Stanford are
delighted to have the game here,"
he said.
"The playing surface is
absolutely great. Even when it's
wet, it's very playable. We have
double the press facilities they
had at Kezar, not to mention the
acres of free parking.
The move to Stanford has long
been advocated by the PALO
club, the Palo Alto Chamber of
Commerce, and Shriners in the
Midpeninsula.
University of Southern
California Coach John McKay,
who will coach the West in this
year's game was happy with the
switch. "It will be nice to have the
advantage of playing on a college
field."
McKay would have to
relinquish his position as coach
for the Shrine team if the USC
team goes to the Rose Bowl.
However, in the unlikely situation
where Stanford would be going to
the Rose Bowl, two teams would
share the training facilities. It is
expected that there would be no
problem.
The East-West Shrine game has
gained a new home—the Stanford
Stadium. The annual match is a
collegiate all-star game, with
proceeds going to the San
Francisco Shriner's Hospital for
Crippled Children. This year the
game will be held here on
Saturday, December 27.
The game was played in Kezar
Stadium in San Francisco from
1927 to 1967 with the single
exception of the 1942 match
which was held in New Orleans.
Dissatisfaction with Kezar
resulted in a move to Candlestick
Park after rumors of a possible
move to the University of
California at Berkeley.
Kezar could seat about 60,000
but had abysmal parking facilities
while Candlestick Park could only
hold 45,000. By comparison
Stanford Stadium provides
accomodation for 87,000 and a
large amount of free parking.
The Stanford Stadium was
opened in 1921 and is still one of
the largest in the country. It was
used for the 1932 and 1960
Olympic Games trials and the
Soviet-U.S.A. track meet in 1962.
Because of Stanford's larger
capacity, it is expected that the
move will increase the Shrine's
monetary returns from the game.
Stanford will get only operating
expenses in addition to managing
the concessions.
The game will probably be a
sell-out, as it has been in past
years.
In explaining the move, Shrine
spokesman Francis Powers said,
"We can't take the risk of
counting on Candlestick this year.
They will be laying synthetic turf
in their renovation of Candlestick
and they'll probably be well into
the project about the time we'd
want to use the field. We can't
take the risk."
"The Shrine people are
tremendously happy about the
change," Powers added. "This is
the centennial of college football,
and it will be great to play the
45th renewal of the Shrine game
