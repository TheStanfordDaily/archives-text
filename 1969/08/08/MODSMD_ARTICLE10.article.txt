• Silver Spike Found
The missing silver spike has
been found.
One hundred years ago, when
the nation's first transcontinental
railroad was completed at
Promontory Summit, Utah, the
ceremony focused on the driving
of the symbolic last spike. It was
made of gold.
But there were four "last
spikes," and one of them, given
by the State of Nevada and made
of pure Virginia City silver, has
been missing for 12 years.
During an extensive
recataloguing of the Stanford
University Museum's collections,
Kurt Luckner, Department of Art
graduate student from Stafford
Spring, Conn., unlocked a metal
filing cabinet containing ancient
jewelry. There he found the silver
spike, in excellent condition
inside a plastic case. It apparently
had been placed in the locked file
for security purposes.
Officials in charge of the
centennial observance of the
completion of the railroad, held at
Promontory Summit in May, had
asked for the silver spike for
display purposes.
• High School Program
A hovercraft, burglar alarms,
and telescopes were among the
products of a special Stanford
summer course for 30
Mexican-American sophomores
from San Jose's Overfelt High
School.
The four-week session
sponsored by the Physics
Department even gave the
high-schoolers a chance to try
making a computer translate
Spanish to English and vice versa.
Another group specialized in
photography, and all 30 will
, receive high school science credits
for their volunteer summer work.
The program was intended to
acquaint the students with college
life and encourage them to
continue their education after
high school, the sponsors said.
Supported with federal aid by San
Jose's East Side Union High
School District and a $1,000 grant
from the Associated Students of
Stanford, the summer course is
now in its fifth year. The first two
years were funded by "seed
grants" from the Rosenberg
Foundation of San Francisco.
The course began June 30 with
morning lectures, followed by
afternoon "lab" sessions at which
the sophomores carried out their
special photography, computer,
and device-building projects.
Stanford faculty members and
graduate students provided free
advice, help, and lectures on such
subjects as lasers, the space
program, computers and
high-energy physics.
The outside funds covered
expenses for materials as well as
for a counselor and a teacher from
hi'gh school, and for
M e x i c a n - American college

undergraduates to serve as tutors.
The program proved highly
successful, as in past years, and is
being studied by other colleges
and universities considering
similar summer programs.
* Media And Ghettos
Publishers and broadcasters
should be sent to live for a week
in the ghetto on a welfare check
to teach them what's going on, a
noted author 1 " and critic told a
seminar at Stanford University
Tuesday night.
Ben Bagdikian, a frequent
critic of the mass media and now
a researcher at the RAND Corp.,
Santa Monica, told a group of
young journalists and journalism
teachers:
"I would dump every reform
movement I ever heard of to allow
publishers and broadcasters to live
for a week in Hough (Cleveland),
Watts (Los Angeles), Newark or
anywhere else on a welfare check.
"You'd have the damnedest
confrontation with the
establishment you ever saw!"
Bagdikian, a former
investigative reporter for the

Providence Journal-Bulletin,
addressed one of the opening
sessions of the month-long
Institute for Law and Ethics in an
Urban Society, sponsored by
Stanford's Communication
Department.
He said the mass media, and
particularly television, are
avoiding their responsibilities for
their massive effect on society
because they put commercial
rather than ethical goals first.
"There's nothing particularly
wrong with this," he told the
group of 50 participants, "but
they ought to let in more opinions
opposite to their own."
He emphasized the impact of
TV on the young—youngsters
whose minds are being formed
between the ages of four and
seven—and pointed out that they
are being fed the "ethics and
values of television" before they
can read.
"But violence and aggression
are cheap, easy to present and
draw the most customers,
"Bagdikian said, "and that's what
you get.
"Since television is our church
and school, it should be governed
by a code of ethics," he said. "Yet
TV seeks the lowest common
denominator to reach the mass
market. The public raises hell

other places a reader can go for
information, including books and
magazines."
Both types of media must
admit they influence "the
national conduct" and accept
their responsibilities, he said.
• SEL Lab Splits
Two new laboratories have
been created from the former
Systems Theory Laboratory
within the Stanford Electronics
Laboratories (SEL), it was
announced by Prof. William R.
Rambo, SEL director.
Profs. Gene F. Franklin and
Edward J. McCluskey,
respectively, will head the new
Information Systems Laboratory
and the Digital Systems
Laboratory. The first will be
concerned with communication
and control engineering, and the
second with digital computer
design.
The reorganization is in
keeping with modern trends
toward greater specialization,
Prof. Rambo said, and will
improve administration of these
activities. Both laboratories will
be housed in the Electronics
Research Laboratory where space
recently became available with the
move of several SEL research
groups to the new Durand
Building nearby.
