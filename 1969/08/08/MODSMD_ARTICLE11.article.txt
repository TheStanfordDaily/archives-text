# Sounds Like Summer
## New York Chamber Soloists 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
I went to the New York
Chamber Soloists Tuesday evening
expecting a good performance,
but I was treated to a superlative
one. Even though the repetoire
spanned nearly three hundred
years, the versatile Soloists played
each work with finesse and
understanding.
This is by far the most talented
musical group to have appeared at
the Summer Festival this year; its
strength is augmented by the fact
that it is an unconventional group,
doing away with the stale old
combinations of instruments.
Beginning with the Baroque,
•■epresentative pieces from the

Classical, Romantic and Modern
periods were included in the
program, and the Soloists
executed each work as if they
specialized in that style only.
It takes power and quality to
cut through Mem Aud's cardboard
acoustics, but the opening
number, Handel's "Trio Sonata
for Oboe, Violin, Cello and
Harpsichord," was delicate and
crisp and played in perfect
ensemble. Respect for the
Soloists' ability kept increasing.
Henry Brant's striking
composition, "The Crossing," was
scored for the entire
ensemble—tenor, flute, oboe,
violin, viola, cello and
harpsichord, and not surprisingly,
was written especially for them. It
must be an incredibly demanding
composition, complicated by the
physical set-up, with harpsichord
and strings onstage, woodwinds
flanking the audience, and tenor
at the back of the theater. But so
fine is the Soloists' rapport that
they seemed to be playing under a
baton.
The Ravel piece, "Chansons
ma d ecasses," featured Charles
Bressler, the tenor, and he was
outstanding. French is a difficult
language in which to sing
operatically, and still be
understood. Most singers make no
attempt to enunciate, but Mr.
