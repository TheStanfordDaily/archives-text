A storeroom in the Controller's
Office was cleared out recently to
make available more office space
in Encina Hall and there, hidden
on a bottom shelf all these years,
was a stock of three bedpans.
Encina was not used as a men's
dormitory after September, 1955,
when Wilbur Hall was opened, and
remodeling into offices did not
start until June, 1958.
In the interim the building was
used as an infirmary during an
influenza epidemic, which
explains those bedpans—and also
raises intersting speculation about
what might be found in other
storerooms in Encina.

Bressler sang clearly enough so
that the libretto was
understandable. Seldom can be
heard such a combination of
accuracy and artistry.
The Soloists performed
Mozart's well-known Piano
Quartet in E-flat Major, and
Beethoven's rather obscure "Five
Irish Songs" with complete grace,
which by that time was expected.
Mel Powell's "Miniatures,"
however, was a piece that should
have been avoided. Having heard
the Soloists prove themselves
masters of any style of music, I do
not believe that this very recent
piece was beyond their ability or
vision; rather, as music, it simply
did not measure up to the level of
the other five works.
Mr. Powell has been a jazz
pianist, and it seems that, in his
effort to break into a new bag, he
has gone through the dictionary
of contemporary musical cliches,
producing a disjointed and
unsatisfying rambling. Atonality
must not be equated with art—but
of course, neither must blind
devotion to any style.
J wonder why the New York
Chamber Soloists wish to be
known as Soloists rather than
Ensemble. As individuals, they
certainly are superb, but the
greatness of a chamber group is in
how well they play together. In
this, the Soloists are unsurpassed;
each of the seven artists adds a bit
of beauty to the splender of the
whole.
This magnificent group will
play twice more at the Festival.
Tonight at 8 p.m. in Mem Aud,
they will play Telemann, Handel,
Haydn, Mozart, Roussel, and
Elliott Carter. Saturday, they join
the New York Rock and Roll
Ensemble for some
Italian/Rock —and all sorts of
amazing things are likely to
happen.
The Soloists have recorded on
Decca and Nonesuch; the
Ensemble records on ATCO. I'm
anxious to have them cut a record
together. Go hear them, and see
why.

The Soloists performed
Mozart's well-known Piano
Quartet in E-flat Major, and
Beethoven's rather obscure "Five
Irish Songs" with complete grace,
which by that time was expected.
Mel Powell's "Miniatures,"
however, was a piece that should
have been avoided. Having heard
the Soloists prove themselves
masters of any style of music, I do
not believe that this very recent
piece was beyond their ability or
vision; rather, as music, it simply
did not measure up to the level of
the other five works.
Mr. Powell has been a jazz
pianist, and it seems that, in his
effort to break into a new bag, he
has gone through the dictionary
of contemporary musical cliches,
producing a disjointed and
unsatisfying rambling. Atonality
must not be equated with art—but
of course, neither must blind
devotion to any style.
J wonder why the New York
Chamber Soloists wish to be
known as Soloists rather than
Ensemble. As individuals, they
certainly are superb, but the
greatness of a chamber group is in
how well they play together. In
this, the Soloists are unsurpassed;
each of the seven artists adds a bit
of beauty to the splender of the
whole.
This magnificent group will
play twice more at the Festival.
Tonight at 8 p.m. in Mem Aud,
they will play Telemann, Handel,
Haydn, Mozart, Roussel, and
Elliott Carter. Saturday, they join
the New York Rock and Roll
Ensemble for some
Italian/Rock —and all sorts of
amazing things are likely to
happen.
The Soloists have recorded on
Decca and Nonesuch; the
Ensemble records on ATCO. I'm
anxious to have them cut a record
together. Go hear them, and see
why.
A storeroom in the Controller's
Office was cleared out recently to
make available more office space
in Encina Hall and there, hidden
on a bottom shelf all these years,
was a stock of three bedpans.
Encina was not used as a men's
dormitory after September, 1955,
when Wilbur Hall was opened, and
remodeling into offices did not
start until June, 1958.
In the interim the building was
used as an infirmary during an
influenza epidemic, which
explains those bedpans—and also
raises intersting speculation about
what might be found in other
storerooms in Encina.

Bressler sang clearly enough so
that the libretto was
understandable. Seldom can be
heard such a combination of
accuracy and artistry.
