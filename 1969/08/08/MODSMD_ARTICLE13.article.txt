## Maybe Next Time 
### DAVE STEVENS 
I find myself applying a
curious double-standard to music.
Thus, an unknown group like
Kaleidoscope gets a better review
than the newest supergroup, Blind
Faith, does the next.
In a strictly absolute sense, of
course, it's unfair. And that's
because just a few times in my
life, a certain type or piece of
music heard for the first time
transcends itself, ceases to be just
good music and becomes
revelation.
For me it happened the first
time I heard Ray Charles doing
"What'd I Say", in his pre-string
arrangement days; the first time I
heard Art Blakey, the great jazz
drummer; the first time I heard
Mike Bloomfield on that initial
Butterfield album; a full year and
a half before the rock scene really
opened up; the first time I saw
Cream, or Hendrix; listening to
Otis Redding on hash at a friend's
house and finally getting into
Memphis soul music; Sgt.
Pepper's; Little Walter; Elmore
James; and the day the same
friend walked in my room with an
English album called "Fresh
Cream" and raving about
somebody named Eric Clapton.
That kind of experience is rare,
a step- beyond the perfectly
acceptable music you usually
listen to, or maybe two steps
(Hendrix, Coltrane). It's not really
just music any more, but an
experience (have you ever been
Experienced?), something that
takes you someplace new,
different, maybe someplace
you've been scared to go before
(Coltrane).
And the sad part of it is, the
part that makes for the double
standard, is that you expect it
from certain people. Bloomfield
has burnt himself out-Coltrane is
dead- and Blind Faith, Clapton,
Winwood, Baker and all the king's
men, is simply not a revelation.
A week late, but the Blind
Faith album is here, with its
choice of album covers: a group
picture of the quartet, or a
bare-breasted eleven-year old girl
holding a model airplane in what
looks like Foothill Park. I didn't
get much action when I was
eleven, so it wasn't a hard choice.
But as for the music . . .
By any account, the record
must be scored as a major
disappointment. Not to say that
there isn't good solid rock under
those pre-puberty titties—there is.
That's where the double standard
comes in: with these people, you
come to expect much more than
just solid music.
Neither Clapton, Baker, nor
Winwood have gone very far from
where they were before with this
new group. You can hear late
Traffic all over the place, which
might be fine a year or two ago,
but isn't today.
As for Traffic, I miss Dave
Mason's guitar and compositions,
which blended so well with
Steve's voice, and Chris Wood's
sensitive horn work. And I hate
middle-period Cream, the Disraeli
Gears Cream that lost the gutsy
direction of the first album and
which eventually resulted in
Clapton's dissatisfaction with the
Jack Bruce-dominated studio art
rock of Wheels of Fire.
Bruce at least knows what he
wants to do, and does it well (he's
just completed a solo album in
London). And this new record
shows the same lack of
orientation, of group identity that
crippled the Cream.
"Had to Cry Today", the first
cut on the album, is a perfect
example. It's right out of Disraeli
Clears- "Sunshine of Your Love",
in fact. Like "Sunshine," this song

figure over which the rest of the
tune is constructed.
But whereas the Cream effort
was a classic top-40 single, with its
nice riff, repeated title phrase, and
slighly silly lyric feeling, "Had to
Cry Today" is a woefully
misdirected composition. First,
the vocal doesn't jell with the
snappy guitar riff—the lyrics are
sad, and besides, Winwood's thick
voice mix ends up sounding like
somebody spilled chocolate syrup
on the grooves.
Beyond that, the song is
ridiculously long (almost nine
minutes), and to no particular
effect: the words mostly repeat
themselves; Clapton's two solos
(the second one double-tracked)
go nowhere; and there is no
building of intensity, as Cream did
so well on "Tales of Brave
Ulysses".
In short, the song doesn't
know what it wants to be: the
pieces don't fit together. As it
stands, it's a mongoloid pop
single. And as far as Top-40 hits
go, I'll take the all-time idiot
group, Tommy James and the
Shondells, doing "Crystal Blue
Persuasion" to this.
"Presence of the Lord" is that
rarity —an Eric Clapton
composition. This one's about
how he"finally found a place to
live/In the presence of the Lord",
which is probably going to
confuse all the people who were
laboring under the impression that
Clapton was God.
Oh well.
The song is typical of the
album: a very forgettable tune
saved by the technical
competence of the band. Two
slowly sung stanzas to start; a
good up-tempo wah-wah spot by
Clapton which breaks the mood;
then a return to the original pace
with the last vocal chorus,
Clapton's guitar fills keeping the
tension he created in the solo.
Over and out.
"Well All Right" is an old
Buddy Holly song—perhaps Blind
Faith's salute to the "rock and
roll revival" fad which has been
going on in England for some
time. Holly was a founding father
of early rock (the Texas
rockabilly sound of songs like
"Peggy Sue") who died in a plane
crash with Richie Valens and the
Big Bopper.
Winwood seems comfortable
with the song, and it might have
been nice to hear some of his light
country-flavored guitar on this
cut. But all in all, one of the
better songs on he album.
My favorite cuts are "Can't
Find My Way Home" and "Sea of
Joy", reminiscent of the beautiful
Winwood vocal sound of "No
Face, No Name, No Number"
from the Traffic days.
The former is especially
nice-some thoughtful soft guitar
chords by Clapton, and an intense
vocal which brings the Ray
Charles ballad style to mind. And
Baker is good here, contributing
to the mood of the song
tastefully, playing almost
melodically, like a jazz drummer.
The rave-up of the album is
Ginger Baker's "Do What You
Like". You remember Ginger
Baker the song-writer; "Blue
Condition" from Disraeli Gears,
the song with a lisp and all those
inventive -tion rhymes? This song
is equally dumb lyrically, but it's
an attractive piece for jamming,
mainly because it's in 5/4—the
same funky rhythm as on Dave
Brubek's "Take Five."
And Clapton does a beautiful
job on it, his most cliche-free
playing since "Fresh Cream", with
a nice jazz feel. Why don't we
hear more of this?
Winwood's solo goes nowhere,
iirKinVi it IJrf am 112 r\ V»»r

organ work on "Waltz for
Lumumba" on the Spencer Davis
"Heavies" lp some for tasteful
jazz playing. Baker's drum solo is
about twice as good as the live
solo on "Toad" from Wheels of
Fire : it's about half as long.
Drum solos are getting to be
the biggest bore since the
Peppermint Twist. There must be
twenty jazz drummers who can
play circles around Baker, and
who don't take up a third of an
album side to prove it.
While we're at it, we might as
well bring back Gene Krupa and
Buddy Rich and Jazz at the
Philharmonic and have a good old
fashioned two-hour drum battle.
Beat them skins! Yahoo! Jesus.
Here again is the group's
problem—an inability to break out
of the old forms, in this case the
boring and over-long drum solos.
And can you really blame them?
The way we react to it—gee whiz,
Ginger, that's great. Eric is God.
Steve is a new Ray Charles.
But there are good spots, and
one or two great ones. Maybe
next time they'll really get it
together.
Already I can hardly wait.
I find myself applying a
curious double-standard to music.

Kaleidoscope gets a better review

from the Traffic days.
The former is especially
nice-some thoughtful soft guitar
chords by Clapton, and an intense
vocal which brings the Ray
Charles ballad style to mind. And
Baker is good here, contributing
to the mood of the song
tastefully, playing almost
melodically, like a jazz drummer.
The rave-up of the album is
Ginger Baker's "Do What You
Like". You remember Ginger
Baker the song-writer; "Blue
Condition" from Disraeli Gears,
the song with a lisp and all those
inventive -tion rhymes? This song
is equally dumb lyrically, but it's
an attractive piece for jamming,
mainly because it's in 5/4—the
same funky rhythm as on Dave
Brubek's "Take Five."
And Clapton does a beautiful
job on it, his most cliche-free
playing since "Fresh Cream", with
a nice jazz feel. Why don't we
hear more of this?
Winwood's solo goes nowhere,
iirKinVi it IJrf am 112 r\ V»»r

organ work on "Waltz for
Lumumba" on the Spencer Davis
"Heavies" lp some for tasteful
jazz playing. Baker's drum solo is
about twice as good as the live
solo on "Toad" from Wheels of
Fire : it's about half as long.
Drum solos are getting to be
the biggest bore since the
Peppermint Twist. There must be
twenty jazz drummers who can
play circles around Baker, and
who don't take up a third of an
album side to prove it.
While we're at it, we might as
well bring back Gene Krupa and
Buddy Rich and Jazz at the
Philharmonic and have a good old
fashioned two-hour drum battle.
Beat them skins! Yahoo! Jesus.
Here again is the group's
problem—an inability to break out
of the old forms, in this case the
boring and over-long drum solos.
And can you really blame them?
The way we react to it—gee whiz,
Ginger, that's great. Eric is God.
Steve is a new Ray Charles.
But there are good spots, and
one or two great ones. Maybe
next time they'll really get it
together.
Already I can hardly wait.
I find myself applying a
curious double-standard to music.
Thus, an unknown group like
Kaleidoscope gets a better review
than the newest supergroup, Blind
Faith, does the next.
In a strictly absolute sense, of
course, it's unfair. And that's
because just a few times in my
life, a certain type or piece of
music heard for the first time
transcends itself, ceases to be just
good music and becomes
revelation.
For me it happened the first
time I heard Ray Charles doing
"What'd I Say", in his pre-string
arrangement days; the first time I
heard Art Blakey, the great jazz
drummer; the first time I heard
Mike Bloomfield on that initial
Butterfield album; a full year and
a half before the rock scene really
opened up; the first time I saw
Cream, or Hendrix; listening to
Otis Redding on hash at a friend's
house and finally getting into
Memphis soul music; Sgt.
Pepper's; Little Walter; Elmore
James; and the day the same
friend walked in my room with an
English album called "Fresh
Cream" and raving about
somebody named Eric Clapton.
That kind of experience is rare,
a step- beyond the perfectly
acceptable music you usually
listen to, or maybe two steps
(Hendrix, Coltrane). It's not really
just music any more, but an
experience (have you ever been
Experienced?), something that
takes you someplace new,
different, maybe someplace
you've been scared to go before
(Coltrane).
And the sad part of it is, the
part that makes for the double
standard, is that you expect it
from certain people. Bloomfield
has burnt himself out-Coltrane is
dead- and Blind Faith, Clapton,
Winwood, Baker and all the king's
men, is simply not a revelation.
A week late, but the Blind
Faith album is here, with its
choice of album covers: a group
picture of the quartet, or a
bare-breasted eleven-year old girl
holding a model airplane in what
looks like Foothill Park. I didn't
get much action when I was
eleven, so it wasn't a hard choice.
But as for the music . . .
By any account, the record
must be scored as a major
disappointment. Not to say that
there isn't good solid rock under
those pre-puberty titties—there is.
That's where the double standard
comes in: with these people, you
come to expect much more than
just solid music.
Neither Clapton, Baker, nor
Winwood have gone very far from
where they were before with this
new group. You can hear late
Traffic all over the place, which
might be fine a year or two ago,
but isn't today.
As for Traffic, I miss Dave
Mason's guitar and compositions,
which blended so well with
Steve's voice, and Chris Wood's
sensitive horn work. And I hate
middle-period Cream, the Disraeli
Gears Cream that lost the gutsy
direction of the first album and
which eventually resulted in
Clapton's dissatisfaction with the
Jack Bruce-dominated studio art
rock of Wheels of Fire.
Bruce at least knows what he
wants to do, and does it well (he's
just completed a solo album in
London). And this new record
shows the same lack of
orientation, of group identity that
crippled the Cream.
"Had to Cry Today", the first
cut on the album, is a perfect
example. It's right out of Disraeli
Clears- "Sunshine of Your Love",
in fact. Like "Sunshine," this song

figure over which the rest of the
tune is constructed.
But whereas the Cream effort
was a classic top-40 single, with its
nice riff, repeated title phrase, and
slighly silly lyric feeling, "Had to
Cry Today" is a woefully
misdirected composition. First,
the vocal doesn't jell with the
snappy guitar riff—the lyrics are
sad, and besides, Winwood's thick
voice mix ends up sounding like
somebody spilled chocolate syrup
on the grooves.
Beyond that, the song is
ridiculously long (almost nine
minutes), and to no particular
effect: the words mostly repeat
themselves; Clapton's two solos
(the second one double-tracked)
go nowhere; and there is no
building of intensity, as Cream did
so well on "Tales of Brave
Ulysses".
In short, the song doesn't
know what it wants to be: the
pieces don't fit together. As it
stands, it's a mongoloid pop
single. And as far as Top-40 hits
go, I'll take the all-time idiot
group, Tommy James and the
Shondells, doing "Crystal Blue
Persuasion" to this.
"Presence of the Lord" is that
rarity —an Eric Clapton
composition. This one's about
how he"finally found a place to
live/In the presence of the Lord",
which is probably going to
confuse all the people who were
laboring under the impression that
Clapton was God.
Oh well.
The song is typical of the
album: a very forgettable tune
saved by the technical
competence of the band. Two
slowly sung stanzas to start; a
good up-tempo wah-wah spot by
Clapton which breaks the mood;
then a return to the original pace
with the last vocal chorus,
Clapton's guitar fills keeping the
tension he created in the solo.
Over and out.
"Well All Right" is an old
Buddy Holly song—perhaps Blind
Faith's salute to the "rock and
roll revival" fad which has been
going on in England for some
time. Holly was a founding father
of early rock (the Texas
rockabilly sound of songs like
"Peggy Sue") who died in a plane
crash with Richie Valens and the
Big Bopper.
Winwood seems comfortable
with the song, and it might have
been nice to hear some of his light
country-flavored guitar on this
cut. But all in all, one of the
better songs on he album.
My favorite cuts are "Can't
Find My Way Home" and "Sea of
Joy", reminiscent of the beautiful
Winwood vocal sound of "No
Face, No Name, No Number"
from the Traffic days.
The former is especially
nice-some thoughtful soft guitar
chords by Clapton, and an intense
vocal which brings the Ray
Charles ballad style to mind. And
Baker is good here, contributing
to the mood of the song
tastefully, playing almost

sad, and besides, Winwood's thick
voice mix ends up sounding like
somebody spilled chocolate syrup
on the grooves.
Beyond that, the song is
ridiculously long (almost nine
minutes), and to no particular
effect: the words mostly repeat
themselves; Clapton's two solos
(the second one double-tracked)
go nowhere; and there is no
building of intensity, as Cream did
so well on "Tales of Brave
Ulysses".
In short, the song doesn't
know what it wants to be: the
pieces don't fit together. As it
stands, it's a mongoloid pop
single. And as far as Top-40 hits
go, I'll take the all-time idiot
group, Tommy James and the
Shondells, doing "Crystal Blue
Persuasion" to this.
"Presence of the Lord" is that
rarity —an Eric Clapton
composition. This one's about
how he"finally found a place to
live/In the presence of the Lord",
which is probably going to
confuse all the people who were
laboring under the impression that
Clapton was God.
Oh well.
The song is typical of the
album: a very forgettable tune
saved by the technical
competence of the band. Two
slowly sung stanzas to start; a
good up-tempo wah-wah spot by
Clapton which breaks the mood;
then a return to the original pace
with the last vocal chorus,
Clapton's guitar fills keeping the
tension he created in the solo.
Over and out.
"Well All Right" is an old
Buddy Holly song—perhaps Blind
Faith's salute to the "rock and
roll revival" fad which has been
going on in England for some
time. Holly was a founding father
of early rock (the Texas
rockabilly sound of songs like
"Peggy Sue") who died in a plane
crash with Richie Valens and the
Big Bopper.
Winwood seems comfortable
with the song, and it might have
been nice to hear some of his light
country-flavored guitar on this
cut. But all in all, one of the
better songs on he album.
My favorite cuts are "Can't
Find My Way Home" and "Sea of
Joy", reminiscent of the beautiful
Winwood vocal sound of "No
Face, No Name, No Number"
from the Traffic days.
The former is especially
nice-some thoughtful soft guitar
chords by Clapton, and an intense
vocal which brings the Ray
Charles ballad style to mind. And
Baker is good here, contributing
to the mood of the song
tastefully, playing almost
melodically, like a jazz drummer.
The rave-up of the album is
Ginger Baker's "Do What You
Like". You remember Ginger
Baker the song-writer; "Blue
Condition" from Disraeli Gears,
the song with a lisp and all those
inventive -tion rhymes? This song
is equally dumb lyrically, but it's
an attractive piece for jamming,
mainly because it's in 5/4—the
same funky rhythm as on Dave
Brubek's "Take Five."
And Clapton does a beautiful
job on it, his most cliche-free
playing since "Fresh Cream", with
a nice jazz feel. Why don't we
hear more of this?
Winwood's solo goes nowhere,
iirKinVi it IJrf am 112 r\ V»»r

organ work on "Waltz for
Lumumba" on the Spencer Davis
"Heavies" lp some for tasteful
jazz playing. Baker's drum solo is
about twice as good as the live
solo on "Toad" from Wheels of
Fire : it's about half as long.
Drum solos are getting to be
the biggest bore since the
Peppermint Twist. There must be
twenty jazz drummers who can
play circles around Baker, and
who don't take up a third of an
album side to prove it.
While we're at it, we might as
well bring back Gene Krupa and
Buddy Rich and Jazz at the
Philharmonic and have a good old
fashioned two-hour drum battle.
Beat them skins! Yahoo! Jesus.
Here again is the group's
problem—an inability to break out
of the old forms, in this case the
boring and over-long drum solos.
And can you really blame them?
The way we react to it—gee whiz,
Ginger, that's great. Eric is God.
Steve is a new Ray Charles.
But there are good spots, and
one or two great ones. Maybe
next time they'll really get it
together.
Already I can hardly wait.
I find myself applying a
curious double-standard to music.
Thus, an unknown group like
Kaleidoscope gets a better review
than the newest supergroup, Blind
Faith, does the next.
In a strictly absolute sense, of
course, it's unfair. And that's
because just a few times in my
life, a certain type or piece of
music heard for the first time
transcends itself, ceases to be just
good music and becomes
revelation.
For me it happened the first
time I heard Ray Charles doing
"What'd I Say", in his pre-string
arrangement days; the first time I
heard Art Blakey, the great jazz
drummer; the first time I heard
Mike Bloomfield on that initial
Butterfield album; a full year and
a half before the rock scene really
opened up; the first time I saw
Cream, or Hendrix; listening to
Otis Redding on hash at a friend's
house and finally getting into
Memphis soul music; Sgt.
Pepper's; Little Walter; Elmore
James; and the day the same
friend walked in my room with an
English album called "Fresh
Cream" and raving about
somebody named Eric Clapton.
That kind of experience is rare,
a step- beyond the perfectly
acceptable music you usually
listen to, or maybe two steps
(Hendrix, Coltrane). It's not really
just music any more, but an
experience (have you ever been
Experienced?), something that
takes you someplace new,
different, maybe someplace
you've been scared to go before
(Coltrane).
And the sad part of it is, the
part that makes for the double
standard, is that you expect it
from certain people. Bloomfield
has burnt himself out-Coltrane is
dead- and Blind Faith, Clapton,
Winwood, Baker and all the king's
men, is simply not a revelation.
A week late, but the Blind
Faith album is here, with its
choice of album covers: a group
picture of the quartet, or a
bare-breasted eleven-year old girl
holding a model airplane in what
looks like Foothill Park. I didn't
get much action when I was
eleven, so it wasn't a hard choice.
But as for the music . . .
By any account, the record
must be scored as a major
disappointment. Not to say that
there isn't good solid rock under
those pre-puberty titties—there is.
That's where the double standard
comes in: with these people, you
come to expect much more than
just solid music.
Neither Clapton, Baker, nor
Winwood have gone very far from
where they were before with this
new group. You can hear late
Traffic all over the place, which
might be fine a year or two ago,
but isn't today.
As for Traffic, I miss Dave
Mason's guitar and compositions,
which blended so well with
Steve's voice, and Chris Wood's
sensitive horn work. And I hate
middle-period Cream, the Disraeli
Gears Cream that lost the gutsy
direction of the first album and
which eventually resulted in
Clapton's dissatisfaction with the
Jack Bruce-dominated studio art
rock of Wheels of Fire.
Bruce at least knows what he
wants to do, and does it well (he's
just completed a solo album in
London). And this new record
shows the same lack of
orientation, of group identity that
crippled the Cream.
"Had to Cry Today", the first
cut on the album, is a perfect
example. It's right out of Disraeli
Clears- "Sunshine of Your Love",
in fact. Like "Sunshine," this song

figure over which the rest of the
tune is constructed.
But whereas the Cream effort
was a classic top-40 single, with its
nice riff, repeated title phrase, and
slighly silly lyric feeling, "Had to
Cry Today" is a woefully
misdirected composition. First,
the vocal doesn't jell with the
snappy guitar riff—the lyrics are
sad, and besides, Winwood's thick
voice mix ends up sounding like
somebody spilled chocolate syrup
on the grooves.
Beyond that, the song is
ridiculously long (almost nine
minutes), and to no particular
effect: the words mostly repeat
themselves; Clapton's two solos
(the second one double-tracked)
go nowhere; and there is no
building of intensity, as Cream did
so well on "Tales of Brave
Ulysses".
In short, the song doesn't

pieces don't fit together. As it

dead- and Blind Faith, Clapton,
Winwood, Baker and all the king's
men, is simply not a revelation.
A week late, but the Blind
Faith album is here, with its
choice of album covers: a group
picture of the quartet, or a
bare-breasted eleven-year old girl
holding a model airplane in what
looks like Foothill Park. I didn't
get much action when I was
eleven, so it wasn't a hard choice.
But as for the music . . .
By any account, the record
must be scored as a major
disappointment. Not to say that
there isn't good solid rock under
those pre-puberty titties—there is.
That's where the double standard
comes in: with these people, you
come to expect much more than
just solid music.
Neither Clapton, Baker, nor
Winwood have gone very far from
where they were before with this
new group. You can hear late
Traffic all over the place, which
might be fine a year or two ago,
but isn't today.
As for Traffic, I miss Dave
Mason's guitar and compositions,
which blended so well with
Steve's voice, and Chris Wood's
sensitive horn work. And I hate
middle-period Cream, the Disraeli
Gears Cream that lost the gutsy
direction of the first album and
which eventually resulted in
Clapton's dissatisfaction with the
Jack Bruce-dominated studio art
rock of Wheels of Fire.
Bruce at least knows what he
wants to do, and does it well (he's
just completed a solo album in
London). And this new record
shows the same lack of
orientation, of group identity that
crippled the Cream.
"Had to Cry Today", the first
cut on the album, is a perfect
example. It's right out of Disraeli
Clears- "Sunshine of Your Love",
in fact. Like "Sunshine," this song

figure over which the rest of the
tune is constructed.
But whereas the Cream effort
was a classic top-40 single, with its
nice riff, repeated title phrase, and
slighly silly lyric feeling, "Had to
Cry Today" is a woefully
misdirected composition. First,
the vocal doesn't jell with the
snappy guitar riff—the lyrics are
sad, and besides, Winwood's thick
voice mix ends up sounding like
somebody spilled chocolate syrup
on the grooves.
Beyond that, the song is
ridiculously long (almost nine
minutes), and to no particular
effect: the words mostly repeat
themselves; Clapton's two solos
(the second one double-tracked)
go nowhere; and there is no
building of intensity, as Cream did
so well on "Tales of Brave
Ulysses".
In short, the song doesn't
know what it wants to be: the
pieces don't fit together. As it
stands, it's a mongoloid pop
single. And as far as Top-40 hits
go, I'll take the all-time idiot
group, Tommy James and the
Shondells, doing "Crystal Blue
Persuasion" to this.
"Presence of the Lord" is that
rarity —an Eric Clapton
composition. This one's about
how he"finally found a place to
live/In the presence of the Lord",
which is probably going to
confuse all the people who were
laboring under the impression that
Clapton was God.
Oh well.
The song is typical of the
album: a very forgettable tune
saved by the technical
competence of the band. Two
slowly sung stanzas to start; a
good up-tempo wah-wah spot by
Clapton which breaks the mood;
then a return to the original pace
with the last vocal chorus,
Clapton's guitar fills keeping the
tension he created in the solo.
Over and out.
"Well All Right" is an old
Buddy Holly song—perhaps Blind
Faith's salute to the "rock and
roll revival" fad which has been
going on in England for some
time. Holly was a founding father
of early rock (the Texas
rockabilly sound of songs like
"Peggy Sue") who died in a plane
crash with Richie Valens and the
Big Bopper.
Winwood seems comfortable
with the song, and it might have
been nice to hear some of his light
country-flavored guitar on this
cut. But all in all, one of the
better songs on he album.
My favorite cuts are "Can't
Find My Way Home" and "Sea of
Joy", reminiscent of the beautiful
Winwood vocal sound of "No
Face, No Name, No Number"
from the Traffic days.
The former is especially
nice-some thoughtful soft guitar
chords by Clapton, and an intense
vocal which brings the Ray
Charles ballad style to mind. And
Baker is good here, contributing
to the mood of the song
tastefully, playing almost
melodically, like a jazz drummer.
The rave-up of the album is
Ginger Baker's "Do What You
Like". You remember Ginger
Baker the song-writer; "Blue
Condition" from Disraeli Gears,
the song with a lisp and all those
inventive -tion rhymes? This song
is equally dumb lyrically, but it's
an attractive piece for jamming,
mainly because it's in 5/4—the
same funky rhythm as on Dave
Brubek's "Take Five."
And Clapton does a beautiful
job on it, his most cliche-free
playing since "Fresh Cream", with
a nice jazz feel. Why don't we
hear more of this?
Winwood's solo goes nowhere,
iirKinVi it IJrf am 112 r\ V»»r

organ work on "Waltz for
Lumumba" on the Spencer Davis
"Heavies" lp some for tasteful
jazz playing. Baker's drum solo is
about twice as good as the live
solo on "Toad" from Wheels of
Fire : it's about half as long.
Drum solos are getting to be
the biggest bore since the
Peppermint Twist. There must be
twenty jazz drummers who can
play circles around Baker, and
who don't take up a third of an
album side to prove it.
While we're at it, we might as
well bring back Gene Krupa and
Buddy Rich and Jazz at the
Philharmonic and have a good old
fashioned two-hour drum battle.
Beat them skins! Yahoo! Jesus.
Here again is the group's
problem—an inability to break out
of the old forms, in this case the
boring and over-long drum solos.
And can you really blame them?
The way we react to it—gee whiz,
Ginger, that's great. Eric is God.
Steve is a new Ray Charles.
But there are good spots, and
one or two great ones. Maybe
next time they'll really get it
together.
Already I can hardly wait.
I find myself applying a
curious double-standard to music.
Thus, an unknown group like
Kaleidoscope gets a better review
than the newest supergroup, Blind
Faith, does the next.
In a strictly absolute sense, of
course, it's unfair. And that's
because just a few times in my
life, a certain type or piece of
music heard for the first time
transcends itself, ceases to be just
good music and becomes
revelation.
For me it happened the first
time I heard Ray Charles doing
"What'd I Say", in his pre-string
arrangement days; the first time I
heard Art Blakey, the great jazz
drummer; the first time I heard
Mike Bloomfield on that initial
Butterfield album; a full year and
a half before the rock scene really
opened up; the first time I saw
Cream, or Hendrix; listening to
Otis Redding on hash at a friend's
house and finally getting into
Memphis soul music; Sgt.
Pepper's; Little Walter; Elmore
James; and the day the same
friend walked in my room with an
English album called "Fresh
Cream" and raving about
somebody named Eric Clapton.
That kind of experience is rare,
a step- beyond the perfectly
acceptable music you usually
listen to, or maybe two steps
(Hendrix, Coltrane). It's not really
just music any more, but an
experience (have you ever been
Experienced?), something that
takes you someplace new,
different, maybe someplace
you've been scared to go before
(Coltrane).
And the sad part of it is, the
part that makes for the double
standard, is that you expect it
from certain people. Bloomfield
has burnt himself out-Coltrane is
dead- and Blind Faith, Clapton,
Winwood, Baker and all the king's
men, is simply not a revelation.
A week late, but the Blind
Faith album is here, with its
choice of album covers: a group
picture of the quartet, or a
bare-breasted eleven-year old girl
holding a model airplane in what
looks like Foothill Park. I didn't
get much action when I was
eleven, so it wasn't a hard choice.
But as for the music . . .
