## Ragtime Revisited 
### STEVEN G. UNGAR 
"An Evening with Max Morath
at the Turn of the Century,"
sounds like it should be about as
exciting as a pea-shucking contest
at a county fair. Don't kid
yourself. I have to admit I was
s u r pr ised —very pleasantly
surprised—to find that it's more
like a night at the Palace.
Max Morath is a man with a
passion for early twentieth
century America. He collects
gramaphone spools the way other
people collect stamps, and he has
managed to make himself an
expert in ragtime music. Add to
this the fact that he is a fine
musician, a competent comedian,
a good entertainer, and totally,
absolutely fearless, and you have a
one-man show which really takes
off, despite the fact that the
audience (poor souls) is largely
indifferent to the material.
Let me amend that: The
audience starts out indifferent to
the material. I personally couldn't
have cared less about ragtime, or
anything else circa 1910, when I
entered the theater: My mind was
on a mid-term I had the next
morning, the ABM, the upcoming
NFL season, and other mundane
matters of the last third of the
century. But Max Morath, like a
good teacher, managed to transfer
some of his enthusiasm to me, and
by the time he played "Tiger
Rag" in its original Jellyrole
Morton arrangement (using his
left elbow to make the piano
"roar"), I was ready to roar along
with him.
Mr. Morath doesn't confine
himself to music, although that is
obviously his forte. He launches
into dramatic readings from
Finley Peter Dunne and Robert
W. Service, makes up captions for
some of the more distressing
stereopticon slides that are
projected against the set, and at
one point does a song-and-dance
routine accompanied by a
gramaphone, complete with straw
hat and cane.

Some of Mr. Morath's humor is
just awful. He is an Arthur
Godfrey veteran, some of his
jokes are strictly for the Arthur
Godfrey crowd, not at all relevent
to a university community.
Fortunately, these seem to be
stock jokes that Mr. Morath has
incorporated into his act because
most of his audiences (I suspect)
are older than those he faces at
Stanford. But Mr. Morath is sharp
enough also to have some really
funny things to say to us.
It is when he sits at the piano
and plays his beloved ragtime that
Mr. Morath really shines. Ragtime
was just a name to me, before Mr.
Morath made it live and breathe.
Ragtime is really a marvelous
music, with a great variety of
mood and tempo, with lyrics that
can be witty, sentimental, sad
bitter, or ironic.
At any rate, it's marvelous
music when Max Morath is
playing it for you. He seems to
become part of the piano, and as
he bounces up and down on the
piano bench—or half stands when
he gets really excited—you can
almost see the legs of the piano
start dancing, the way they did in
the old cartoons of the Betty
Boops era.
A one-man show is always a
risky affair, and a one-man show
about a subject such as this is a
potential disaster. No matter how
well Mr. Morath played his piano,
no matter how entertaining his
monologue, if he were to start
getting sentimental and nostalgic
for the "good old days" the show
would fly like a lead zeppelin. "I
think that the past is a wonderful
place to visit," says Mr. Morath,
"but I wouldn't want to live
there." Well bravo, Max! I know
how you feel! It's fine to look
back at what things were like
then, whenever "then" was, but
we live in "today," and must not
try to escape from that reality.
Max Morath is not escaping from
anything, and he isn't offering us
a ride to a "far better time"
either. He's just drawing our
attention to an overlooked piece
of Americana which would make
our lives today a lot richer if it
were a bit less overlooked.
One of the readings from
Finley Peter Dunne, written sixty
years ago, was amazingly apropos
to the 1970'5. I don't remember it
exactly, but it had something to
do with the observation that we
are a people continually cleaning
our own house, and that the loud
noise you just heard was not the
first shot of the Revolution, but
America beating the carpet. So
the Revolution was coming sixty
years ago, too! In a strange way,
it's a comforting thing to know.
Thank you, Mr. Morath, for
bringing it to my attention. And
thank you for the stereopticons,
and no thank you for some of the

jokes; thanks a million for the
music.
And while I'm at it, thank you
Mr. Baffrey for the Summer
Festival, which makes Stanford
livable for another six weeks of
the year.
A pleasant summer to all!

indifferent to the material.
Let me amend that: The
audience starts out indifferent to
the material. I personally couldn't
have cared less about ragtime, or
anything else circa 1910, when I
entered the theater: My mind was
on a mid-term I had the next
morning, the ABM, the upcoming
NFL season, and other mundane
matters of the last third of the
century. But Max Morath, like a
good teacher, managed to transfer
some of his enthusiasm to me, and
by the time he played "Tiger
Rag" in its original Jellyrole
Morton arrangement (using his
left elbow to make the piano
"roar"), I was ready to roar along
with him.
Mr. Morath doesn't confine
himself to music, although that is
obviously his forte. He launches
into dramatic readings from
Finley Peter Dunne and Robert
W. Service, makes up captions for
some of the more distressing
stereopticon slides that are
projected against the set, and at
one point does a song-and-dance
routine accompanied by a
gramaphone, complete with straw
hat and cane.

Some of Mr. Morath's humor is
just awful. He is an Arthur
Godfrey veteran, some of his
jokes are strictly for the Arthur
Godfrey crowd, not at all relevent
to a university community.
Fortunately, these seem to be
stock jokes that Mr. Morath has
incorporated into his act because
most of his audiences (I suspect)
are older than those he faces at
Stanford. But Mr. Morath is sharp
enough also to have some really
funny things to say to us.
It is when he sits at the piano
and plays his beloved ragtime that
Mr. Morath really shines. Ragtime
was just a name to me, before Mr.
Morath made it live and breathe.
Ragtime is really a marvelous
music, with a great variety of
mood and tempo, with lyrics that
can be witty, sentimental, sad
bitter, or ironic.
At any rate, it's marvelous
music when Max Morath is
playing it for you. He seems to
become part of the piano, and as
he bounces up and down on the
piano bench—or half stands when
he gets really excited—you can
almost see the legs of the piano
start dancing, the way they did in
the old cartoons of the Betty
Boops era.
A one-man show is always a
risky affair, and a one-man show
about a subject such as this is a
potential disaster. No matter how
well Mr. Morath played his piano,
no matter how entertaining his
monologue, if he were to start
getting sentimental and nostalgic
for the "good old days" the show
would fly like a lead zeppelin. "I
think that the past is a wonderful
place to visit," says Mr. Morath,
"but I wouldn't want to live
there." Well bravo, Max! I know
how you feel! It's fine to look
back at what things were like
then, whenever "then" was, but
we live in "today," and must not
try to escape from that reality.
Max Morath is not escaping from
anything, and he isn't offering us
a ride to a "far better time"
either. He's just drawing our
attention to an overlooked piece
of Americana which would make
our lives today a lot richer if it
were a bit less overlooked.
One of the readings from
Finley Peter Dunne, written sixty
years ago, was amazingly apropos
to the 1970'5. I don't remember it
exactly, but it had something to
do with the observation that we
are a people continually cleaning
our own house, and that the loud
noise you just heard was not the
first shot of the Revolution, but
America beating the carpet. So
the Revolution was coming sixty
years ago, too! In a strange way,
it's a comforting thing to know.
Thank you, Mr. Morath, for
bringing it to my attention. And
thank you for the stereopticons,
and no thank you for some of the

jokes; thanks a million for the
music.
And while I'm at it, thank you
Mr. Baffrey for the Summer
Festival, which makes Stanford
livable for another six weeks of
the year.
A pleasant summer to all!


MAX MORATH
(as depicted by Hirschfeld)
"An Evening with Max Morath
at the Turn of the Century,"
sounds like it should be about as
exciting as a pea-shucking contest
at a county fair. Don't kid
yourself. I have to admit I was
s u r pr ised —very pleasantly
surprised—to find that it's more
like a night at the Palace.
Max Morath is a man with a
passion for early twentieth
century America. He collects
gramaphone spools the way other
people collect stamps, and he has
managed to make himself an
expert in ragtime music. Add to
this the fact that he is a fine
musician, a competent comedian,
a good entertainer, and totally,
absolutely fearless, and you have a
one-man show which really takes
off, despite the fact that the

Finley Peter Dunne and Robert
W. Service, makes up captions for
some of the more distressing
stereopticon slides that are
projected against the set, and at
one point does a song-and-dance
routine accompanied by a
gramaphone, complete with straw
hat and cane.

Some of Mr. Morath's humor is
just awful. He is an Arthur
Godfrey veteran, some of his
jokes are strictly for the Arthur
Godfrey crowd, not at all relevent
to a university community.
Fortunately, these seem to be
stock jokes that Mr. Morath has
incorporated into his act because
most of his audiences (I suspect)
are older than those he faces at
Stanford. But Mr. Morath is sharp
enough also to have some really
funny things to say to us.
It is when he sits at the piano
and plays his beloved ragtime that
Mr. Morath really shines. Ragtime
was just a name to me, before Mr.
Morath made it live and breathe.
Ragtime is really a marvelous
music, with a great variety of
mood and tempo, with lyrics that
can be witty, sentimental, sad
bitter, or ironic.
At any rate, it's marvelous
music when Max Morath is
playing it for you. He seems to
become part of the piano, and as
he bounces up and down on the
piano bench—or half stands when
he gets really excited—you can
almost see the legs of the piano
start dancing, the way they did in
the old cartoons of the Betty
Boops era.
A one-man show is always a
risky affair, and a one-man show
about a subject such as this is a
potential disaster. No matter how
well Mr. Morath played his piano,
no matter how entertaining his
monologue, if he were to start
getting sentimental and nostalgic
for the "good old days" the show
would fly like a lead zeppelin. "I
think that the past is a wonderful
place to visit," says Mr. Morath,
"but I wouldn't want to live
there." Well bravo, Max! I know
how you feel! It's fine to look
back at what things were like
then, whenever "then" was, but
we live in "today," and must not
try to escape from that reality.
Max Morath is not escaping from
anything, and he isn't offering us
a ride to a "far better time"
either. He's just drawing our
attention to an overlooked piece
of Americana which would make
our lives today a lot richer if it
were a bit less overlooked.
One of the readings from
Finley Peter Dunne, written sixty
years ago, was amazingly apropos
to the 1970'5. I don't remember it
exactly, but it had something to
do with the observation that we
are a people continually cleaning
our own house, and that the loud
noise you just heard was not the
first shot of the Revolution, but
America beating the carpet. So
the Revolution was coming sixty
years ago, too! In a strange way,
it's a comforting thing to know.
Thank you, Mr. Morath, for
bringing it to my attention. And
thank you for the stereopticons,
and no thank you for some of the

jokes; thanks a million for the
music.
And while I'm at it, thank you
Mr. Baffrey for the Summer
Festival, which makes Stanford
livable for another six weeks of
the year.
A pleasant summer to all!


MAX MORATH
(as depicted by Hirschfeld)
"An Evening with Max Morath
at the Turn of the Century,"
sounds like it should be about as
exciting as a pea-shucking contest
at a county fair. Don't kid
yourself. I have to admit I was
s u r pr ised —very pleasantly
surprised—to find that it's more
like a night at the Palace.
Max Morath is a man with a
passion for early twentieth
century America. He collects
gramaphone spools the way other
people collect stamps, and he has
managed to make himself an
expert in ragtime music. Add to
this the fact that he is a fine
musician, a competent comedian,
a good entertainer, and totally,
absolutely fearless, and you have a
one-man show which really takes
off, despite the fact that the
audience (poor souls) is largely
indifferent to the material.
Let me amend that: The
audience starts out indifferent to
the material. I personally couldn't
have cared less about ragtime, or
anything else circa 1910, when I
entered the theater: My mind was
on a mid-term I had the next
morning, the ABM, the upcoming
NFL season, and other mundane
matters of the last third of the
century. But Max Morath, like a
good teacher, managed to transfer
some of his enthusiasm to me, and
by the time he played "Tiger
Rag" in its original Jellyrole
Morton arrangement (using his
left elbow to make the piano
"roar"), I was ready to roar along
with him.
Mr. Morath doesn't confine
himself to music, although that is
obviously his forte. He launches
into dramatic readings from
Finley Peter Dunne and Robert
W. Service, makes up captions for
some of the more distressing
stereopticon slides that are
projected against the set, and at
one point does a song-and-dance
routine accompanied by a
gramaphone, complete with straw
hat and cane.
