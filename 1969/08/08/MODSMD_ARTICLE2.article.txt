# Low-Cost Housing Problems Need 'Imaginative Approach'

Yesterday's open discussion

recent request was organized in
response to a recent request issued
by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD)
for university proposals for
researching the factors associated
with the mass-production of
low-cost housing.
HUD, according to Richards, is
looking for two kinds of
proposals. The first, outlines of
complete housing systems, would
involve construction of
prototypes and procedures for
later volume construction.
Ideas And Concepts
The Department will also
accept research on ideas and
concepts that need development
before they can be applied to
specific systems.
Research proposals, Richards
pointed out, are to be submitted
by September 19.
"This research requires an
inter-disciplinary approach,"
stated Richards and noted that
this approach was perhaps "the
look of things to come" in the
research field.
"Should Stanford respond to
this request for research
proposals?" Richards asked
finally, noting that related queries
could include whether Stanford
would have to "reorient its
thinking" if it chose to become
more involved in this type of
"applied research" and whether
"academic freedom" would be
threatened by stressing this
research.
Adviser Discusses Materials
Corbett Hansen, a Danish
engineer and adviser for the
international Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), continued
the discussion by describing his
work involving engineering
materials.
Hansen noted that nearly all
OECD member countries have
suffered shortages in low-cost
housing and that "assembly-line
production" of housing is
urgently needed.
He further cited the recent
statement of a professor at MIT
that the government in the future
would be "less willing to give
money for individual research"
but more concerned for funding
research for "the solution or
urgent problems."
Assembly-line techniques for
the construction of mobile homes,
according to Hansen, is a definite
solution to be studied.
It costs about $8.00 per square
foot, Hansen explained, to build a
mobile home, using
unconventional building materials
while the cost per square foot to
build a conventional home with
conventional building materials is
about $14.00. The cost for a
mobile home, however, could be
reduced to about $4.00, the

engineer stated, utilizing the
proper technology.
He also pointed out that even
using "primitive methods," a
factory can produce ten mobile
homes a day yet "there is no
reason why there can't be 100
produced per day" without a
significant increase in costs.
"It is the purpose of OECD,"
Hansen stated, "to convince
governments that problems can be
assessed and that possible
solutions are available."
Stanford, in addition, could
establish committees from the
different departments to help
study the problem so that each
department could make its own
forecast on the situation.
Basis Of Operation
"The mobile home industry"
should be "our basis of
operation," Hansen stated, "and
assembly line production should
be our goal."
He also noted that "Romney
(the Secretary of HUD) wants a
record production of housing—not
a record production of housing
studies."
The discussion, later opened to
the audience, illustrated the
complex and interdisciplinary
nature of the low-cost housing
problem with comments made by
scholars from diverse disciplines
stressing important disciplinary
considerations the discussion had
previously neglected.
George Kaplan, psychology,
expressed dissatisfaction with the
discussion stating, "it's
hypocritical of us to go out to
find solutions" to low-cost
housing shortages when "Stanford
is significantly contributing to the
problem" by the building of
industrial parks to create jobs for
people when they have no nearby
places to live.
John Rutherford, a consulting
structural engineer, commented
that "the roots of the problem of
housing" include "the hate and
fear that reside in the hearts of
three-fourths of the white voters"
in this country, usually against the
people who need low-cost
housing.

and economics, expressed

people when they have no nearby
places to live.
John Rutherford, a consulting

that "the roots of the problem of

three-fourths of the white voters"
in this country, usually against the
people who need low-cost
housing.
Martin Carnoy, from education

dissatisfaction with the fact that

Civil Engineering Professor
Cedric W. Richards stressed that a
"highly imaginative approach"
will be needed to tackle the
country's low-cost housing
problems, at an open discussion
on low-cost housing yesterday
afternoon sponsored by the
department of civil engineering.
Factors surrounding the issue,
Richards continued, must include
the acceptibility to the general
public, sociological implications,
and studies of building codes,
techniques, and materials.

Yesterday's open discussion
was organized in response to a
recent request was organized in
response to a recent request issued
by the Department of Housing
and Urban Development (HUD)
for university proposals for
researching the factors associated
with the mass-production of
low-cost housing.
HUD, according to Richards, is
looking for two kinds of
proposals. The first, outlines of
complete housing systems, would
involve construction of
prototypes and procedures for
later volume construction.
Ideas And Concepts
The Department will also
accept research on ideas and
concepts that need development
before they can be applied to
specific systems.
Research proposals, Richards
pointed out, are to be submitted
by September 19.
"This research requires an
inter-disciplinary approach,"
stated Richards and noted that
this approach was perhaps "the
look of things to come" in the
research field.
"Should Stanford respond to
this request for research
proposals?" Richards asked
finally, noting that related queries
could include whether Stanford
would have to "reorient its
thinking" if it chose to become
more involved in this type of
"applied research" and whether
"academic freedom" would be
threatened by stressing this
research.
Adviser Discusses Materials
Corbett Hansen, a Danish
engineer and adviser for the
international Organization for
Economic Cooperation and
Development (OECD), continued
the discussion by describing his
work involving engineering
materials.
Hansen noted that nearly all
OECD member countries have
suffered shortages in low-cost
housing and that "assembly-line
production" of housing is
urgently needed.
He further cited the recent
statement of a professor at MIT
that the government in the future
would be "less willing to give
money for individual research"
but more concerned for funding
research for "the solution or
urgent problems."
Assembly-line techniques for
the construction of mobile homes,
according to Hansen, is a definite
solution to be studied.
It costs about $8.00 per square
foot, Hansen explained, to build a
mobile home, using
unconventional building materials
while the cost per square foot to
build a conventional home with
conventional building materials is
about $14.00. The cost for a
mobile home, however, could be
reduced to about $4.00, the

engineer stated, utilizing the
proper technology.
He also pointed out that even
using "primitive methods," a
factory can produce ten mobile
homes a day yet "there is no
reason why there can't be 100
produced per day" without a
significant increase in costs.
"It is the purpose of OECD,"
Hansen stated, "to convince
governments that problems can be
assessed and that possible
solutions are available."
Stanford, in addition, could
establish committees from the
different departments to help
study the problem so that each
department could make its own
forecast on the situation.
Basis Of Operation
"The mobile home industry"
should be "our basis of
operation," Hansen stated, "and
assembly line production should
be our goal."
He also noted that "Romney
(the Secretary of HUD) wants a
record production of housing—not
a record production of housing
studies."
The discussion, later opened to
the audience, illustrated the
complex and interdisciplinary
nature of the low-cost housing
problem with comments made by
scholars from diverse disciplines
stressing important disciplinary
considerations the discussion had
previously neglected.

establish committees from the
different departments to help
study the problem so that each
department could make its own
forecast on the situation.
Basis Of Operation
"The mobile home industry"
should be "our basis of
operation," Hansen stated, "and
assembly line production should
be our goal."
He also noted that "Romney
(the Secretary of HUD) wants a
record production of housing—not
a record production of housing
studies."
The discussion, later opened to
the audience, illustrated the
complex and interdisciplinary
nature of the low-cost housing
problem with comments made by
scholars from diverse disciplines
stressing important disciplinary
considerations the discussion had
previously neglected.
George Kaplan, psychology,
expressed dissatisfaction with the
discussion stating, "it's
hypocritical of us to go out to
find solutions" to low-cost
housing shortages when "Stanford
is significantly contributing to the
problem" by the building of
industrial parks to create jobs for
people when they have no nearby
places to live.
John Rutherford, a consulting
structural engineer, commented
that "the roots of the problem of
housing" include "the hate and
fear that reside in the hearts of
three-fourths of the white voters"
in this country, usually against the
people who need low-cost
housing.
Martin Carnoy, from education
and economics, expressed
dissatisfaction with the fact that
the request for housing proposals
"stresses technological" solutions
and isn't adequately concerned
with economic considerations.
