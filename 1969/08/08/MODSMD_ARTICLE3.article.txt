# Stanford Astronaut Discusses Apollo 11

### HEIDI YORKSHIRE 
"It's still surprizing to me that
the Apollo flights started only ten
months ago," commented
astronaut and Stanford Professor
Owen K. Garriott in his lecture
"Comments on Apollo XI",
yesterday afternoon in Bishop
Auditorium.
"The five-flight sequence of
the Apollo shots was certainly the
minimum planned by the most
optimistic of our scientists," he
added. "Back in October, Apollo
VII tested the Command Service

Module, then Apollo VIII circled
the Moon, Apollo IX proved the
Lunar Module worked, and
Apollo X was the dress rehearsal
for the real thing. It was an
orderly progression, but very
rapid."
Garriott received his Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering at Stanford
in 1960, as well as studying at
Cambridge on a National Science
Fellowship. He then taught at
Stanford until his leave of absence
for space work, and has logged
over 1000 hours of flight time in
training to be an astronaut.
The lecture was titled
"Comments on Apollo XI"
because "we weren't sure, at the
time the talk was scheduled,
whether there would be a man on
the Moon or not," he said. "There
were so many variables in the
planning that the shot might not
have been until August."
Garriott brought with him
films and slides of both the
Apollo X and XI flights that were
taken from on board the
spacecrafts themselves. Unlike the
television shots, these were clear
as any distinct movies made on
Earth, and showed facets of the
Moon's surface as well as the
astronauts.
The films of Apollo X and XI
covered all the phases of the space
flight. Garriott pointed out many


HOVERCRAFT built by Mexican-American sophomores from San Jose's Overfelt
High School got off the ground at Stanford with graduate student Shirley Sandoz
and a young friend aboard. Built of plywood and powered by a lawiimower
motor, the craft is kept under control with ropes manned by graduate students
