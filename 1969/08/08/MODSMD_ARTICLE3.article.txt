# Stanford Astronaut Discusses Apollo 11
## 
### HEIDI YORKSHIRE 
"It's still surprizing to me that
the Apollo flights started only ten
months ago," commented
astronaut and Stanford Professor
Owen K. Garriott in his lecture
"Comments on Apollo XI",
yesterday afternoon in Bishop
Auditorium.
"The five-flight sequence of
the Apollo shots was certainly the
minimum planned by the most
optimistic of our scientists," he
added. "Back in October, Apollo
VII tested the Command Service

Module, then Apollo VIII circled
the Moon, Apollo IX proved the
Lunar Module worked, and
Apollo X was the dress rehearsal
for the real thing. It was an
orderly progression, but very
rapid."
Garriott received his Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering at Stanford
in 1960, as well as studying at
Cambridge on a National Science
Fellowship. He then taught at
Stanford until his leave of absence
for space work, and has logged
over 1000 hours of flight time in
training to be an astronaut.
The lecture was titled
"Comments on Apollo XI"
because "we weren't sure, at the
time the talk was scheduled,
whether there would be a man on
the Moon or not," he said. "There
were so many variables in the
planning that the shot might not
have been until August."
Garriott brought with him
films and slides of both the
Apollo X and XI flights that were
taken from on board the
spacecrafts themselves. Unlike the
television shots, these were clear
as any distinct movies made on
Earth, and showed facets of the
Moon's surface as well as the
astronauts.
The films of Apollo X and XI
covered all the phases of the space
flight. Garriott pointed out many

features of the mission, starting
with the lift-off—during which the
spacecraft consumed fourteen
tons of fuel a second—through the
actual landing of the LEM (lunar
module) on the Moon's surface.
One of the biggest problems
faced in the Apollo XI shot was in
the lunar landing itself. Through
some slightly inaccurate
calculations, the LEM would have
landed in a crater full of
112 ifteen-to-twenty-foot boulders,
rather than on the smooth landing
surface that it needed. It was only
through the operation of some
semi-automatic controls by the
astronauts that this hazard was
avoided.
According to Garriott, by the
time the astronauts completed
this maneuver, they had only
thirty seconds of fuel remaining in
their vehicle, but "this fuel was all
measured very carefully. They
knew exactly how much they had,
so there was no real hazard

Garriott then showed some
slides of the astronauts stepping
onto the lunar surface, and
pointed out that when
Commander Armstrong set foot
on the Moon he jumped up again
before putting both feet on it.
"One of the first things you do
when you go down is to make
sure you can get back up."
"Are we going to make money
on the Moon? I really don't think
that that's a significant question.
However, the manned space
program does have an economic
potential, besides finding out
about man's behavior and
capabilities in space," the
astronaut commented.

weather prediction,
communications, and
meteorology. I don't know about

spacecraft consumed fourteen
tons of fuel a second—through the
actual landing of the LEM (lunar
module) on the Moon's surface.
One of the biggest problems
faced in the Apollo XI shot was in
the lunar landing itself. Through
some slightly inaccurate
calculations, the LEM would have
landed in a crater full of
112 ifteen-to-twenty-foot boulders,
rather than on the smooth landing
surface that it needed. It was only
through the operation of some
semi-automatic controls by the
astronauts that this hazard was
avoided.
According to Garriott, by the
time the astronauts completed
this maneuver, they had only
thirty seconds of fuel remaining in
their vehicle, but "this fuel was all
measured very carefully. They
knew exactly how much they had,
so there was no real hazard

Garriott then showed some
slides of the astronauts stepping
onto the lunar surface, and
pointed out that when
Commander Armstrong set foot
on the Moon he jumped up again
before putting both feet on it.
"One of the first things you do
when you go down is to make
sure you can get back up."
"Are we going to make money
on the Moon? I really don't think
that that's a significant question.
However, the manned space
program does have an economic
potential, besides finding out
about man's behavior and
capabilities in space," the
astronaut commented.

development of Earth resources,

"It's still surprizing to me that
the Apollo flights started only ten
months ago," commented
astronaut and Stanford Professor
Owen K. Garriott in his lecture
"Comments on Apollo XI",
yesterday afternoon in Bishop
Auditorium.
"The five-flight sequence of
the Apollo shots was certainly the
minimum planned by the most
optimistic of our scientists," he
added. "Back in October, Apollo
VII tested the Command Service

Module, then Apollo VIII circled
the Moon, Apollo IX proved the
Lunar Module worked, and
Apollo X was the dress rehearsal
for the real thing. It was an
orderly progression, but very
rapid."
Garriott received his Ph.D. in
Electrical Engineering at Stanford
in 1960, as well as studying at
Cambridge on a National Science
Fellowship. He then taught at
Stanford until his leave of absence
for space work, and has logged
over 1000 hours of flight time in
training to be an astronaut.
The lecture was titled
"Comments on Apollo XI"
because "we weren't sure, at the
time the talk was scheduled,
whether there would be a man on
the Moon or not," he said. "There
were so many variables in the
planning that the shot might not
have been until August."
Garriott brought with him
films and slides of both the
Apollo X and XI flights that were
taken from on board the
spacecrafts themselves. Unlike the
television shots, these were clear
as any distinct movies made on
Earth, and showed facets of the
Moon's surface as well as the
astronauts.

flight. Garriott pointed out many
