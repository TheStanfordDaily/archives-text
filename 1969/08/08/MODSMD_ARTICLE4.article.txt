# Senate OKs Undergrad Studies Dean

### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
With surprising ease, a Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendation that was
supposed to cause sharp
differences within the faculty was
passed yesterday by the Academic
Senate.
At its last meeting, the first
Senate established the post of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
approving seven resolutions

departmental and school
discussions on budgets,
promotions, and hiring of new
faculty.
The main question that split
the Senate in earlier
debate—namely how much
budgetary power the
Undergraduate dean will

resolutions approved yesterday

Pitzer and Provost Richard W.

schools.
The full text of the resolutions
finally passed (the first five,
before amendment, being taken
from the SES report) are:
