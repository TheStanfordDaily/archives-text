# Senate OKs Undergrad Studies Dean
## 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
With surprising ease, a Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendation that was
supposed to cause sharp
differences within the faculty was
passed yesterday by the Academic
Senate.
At its last meeting, the first
Senate established the post of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
approving seven resolutions
dealing with the position, most of
them drawn from the SES report.
The new dean, who will report
directly to the provost, will be
responsible for "continuing review
of Stanford's education of
undergraduates," to "stimulate
and assist educational
innovation," and for working
"with departments to establish
new course offerings intended
primarily for non-specialists,"
according to the resolutions
passed.
Also, the Senate, in its debate,
agreed that the new dean should
participate heavily in
departmental and school
discussions on budgets,
promotions, and hiring of new
faculty.
The main question that split
the Senate in earlier
debate—namely how much
budgetary power the
Undergraduate dean will
have —was not settled by the
resolutions approved yesterday
afternoon's session at the Business
School.
But both President Kenneth S.
Pitzer and Provost Richard W.
Lyman, who were not present at
the Senate's previous meeting
when the floor management
committee presented arguments
for the post, felt that the new
dean should not be a final
budgetary resort for departments
and professors who did not get
funds they wanted from their
schools.
The full text of the resolutions
finally passed (the first five,
before amendment, being taken
from the SES report) are:

The full text of the resolutions
finally passed (the first five,
before amendment, being taken
from the SES report) are:
"1. The University should
officially recognize the need for
enhanced and better focused
faculty and administrative
attention to the problems of
undergraduate education.
"2. The Academic Council
Committees on Undergraduate
Education and General Studies
should be replaced by a single
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies charged with general
responsibility for undergraduate
academic matters. A majority of
the faculty members on this
committee should be from the
School of Humanities and
Sciences. Representation should
also be given to faculty members
from the School of Engineering
and other schools who are
interested in undergraduate
education.
"3. A new administrative
position, Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, should be established to
exercise continuing review of
Stanford's education of
undergraduates, to support and

maintain what is good, to aid in
the renovation of what is
inadequate, and to stimulate and
assist educational innovation.
"4. The Dean and Committee
of Undergraduate Studies should
be specifically charged with
responsibility for working with
departments to develop new
course offerings primarily
intended for non-specialists. In his
effort they should have the
assistance of the Fellows of the
University.
"5. The Dean of Students
should continue to exercise
administrative supervision of
extra-curricular aspects of student
life, including residences and
student services. He should
maintain close contact with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
"6. It is the sense of the
Senate that the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies should
report directly to the Provost.
"7. The Senate endorses the

sense of the Recommendations of
the Stanford Danforth Workshop
Group (1969)."
The last resolution deals with a
report submitted by four
professors—Edwin M. Good,
Lawrence W. Ryan, W. Richard
Scott, and Mason Yearian, who
were at the Danforth Foundation
workshop in Colorado Springs in
July.
They recommended the new
officer "have full status as a
dean," "have his own budget,"
review appointments and
promotions of people dealing with
undergraduate education, and
participate in school budgetary
discussions.
The Senate also discussed
yesterday the report of an ad hoc
committee on he second block of
SES recommendations (the
Undergraduate Dean being the
third block), dealing with the
question of unit credits vs. course
credits.

according to the resolutions
passed.
Also, the Senate, in its debate,
agreed that the new dean should
participate heavily in
departmental and school
discussions on budgets,
promotions, and hiring of new
faculty.
The main question that split
the Senate in earlier
debate—namely how much
budgetary power the
Undergraduate dean will
have —was not settled by the
resolutions approved yesterday
afternoon's session at the Business
School.
But both President Kenneth S.
Pitzer and Provost Richard W.
Lyman, who were not present at
the Senate's previous meeting
when the floor management
committee presented arguments
for the post, felt that the new
dean should not be a final
budgetary resort for departments
and professors who did not get
funds they wanted from their
schools.
The full text of the resolutions
finally passed (the first five,
before amendment, being taken
from the SES report) are:
"1. The University should
officially recognize the need for
enhanced and better focused
faculty and administrative
attention to the problems of
undergraduate education.
"2. The Academic Council
Committees on Undergraduate
Education and General Studies
should be replaced by a single
Committee on Undergraduate
Studies charged with general
responsibility for undergraduate
academic matters. A majority of
the faculty members on this
committee should be from the
School of Humanities and
Sciences. Representation should
also be given to faculty members
from the School of Engineering
and other schools who are
interested in undergraduate
education.
"3. A new administrative
position, Dean of Undergraduate
Studies, should be established to
exercise continuing review of
Stanford's education of
undergraduates, to support and

maintain what is good, to aid in
the renovation of what is
inadequate, and to stimulate and
assist educational innovation.
"4. The Dean and Committee
of Undergraduate Studies should
be specifically charged with
responsibility for working with
departments to develop new
course offerings primarily
intended for non-specialists. In his
effort they should have the
assistance of the Fellows of the
University.
"5. The Dean of Students
should continue to exercise
administrative supervision of
extra-curricular aspects of student
life, including residences and
student services. He should
maintain close contact with the
Dean of Undergraduate Studies.
"6. It is the sense of the
Senate that the Dean of
Undergraduate Studies should
report directly to the Provost.
"7. The Senate endorses the

sense of the Recommendations of
the Stanford Danforth Workshop
Group (1969)."
The last resolution deals with a
report submitted by four
professors—Edwin M. Good,
Lawrence W. Ryan, W. Richard
Scott, and Mason Yearian, who
were at the Danforth Foundation
workshop in Colorado Springs in
July.
They recommended the new
officer "have full status as a
dean," "have his own budget,"
review appointments and
promotions of people dealing with
undergraduate education, and
participate in school budgetary
discussions.
The Senate also discussed
yesterday the report of an ad hoc
committee on he second block of
SES recommendations (the
Undergraduate Dean being the
third block), dealing with the
question of unit credits vs. course
credits.


"Both the STANFORD DAILY and the beach are free. Enjoy them."
With surprising ease, a Study of
Education at Stanford (SES)
recommendation that was
supposed to cause sharp
differences within the faculty was
passed yesterday by the Academic
Senate.
At its last meeting, the first
Senate established the post of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies,
approving seven resolutions
dealing with the position, most of
them drawn from the SES report.
The new dean, who will report
directly to the provost, will be
responsible for "continuing review
of Stanford's education of
undergraduates," to "stimulate
and assist educational
innovation," and for working
"with departments to establish
new course offerings intended
