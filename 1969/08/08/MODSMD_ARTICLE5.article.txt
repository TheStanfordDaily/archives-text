# Overseas Campuses Rules Altered
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Major changes in the regulations governing
students at the five Stanford overseas
campuses have been put into effect by the
overseas campus directors.
Overseas Campuses rules no longer say that
students must be in residence at the overseas
campus from Sunday night through Friday
morning.
Previously the campus administrations
overseas had enforced this rule, for example,
by checking class attendance Monday
mornings. Exceptions were often granted, in
recent years, to allow students to leave for
weekend journeys on Thursdays.
Now all class attendance requirements are
at the discretion of the instructor, according
to the new regulations adopted by the
overseas campus directors at their Vienna
meeting in early July.
The old "residence" rule said: "All
students enrolled at any one of the Stanford
Overseas Campuses are required to reside at
their campus and to participate in the
academic program, including scheduled

local tours and field trips."
The new rule, which went into effect this
quarter, reads: "All students attending any
one of the Stanford Overseas Campuses are
required to be enrolled in the academic
program, to attend the orientation program,
and to participate in the major field trips of
each group. In accordance with University
policy, individual instructors may include
attendance and participation in class work as
factors in evaluating students' performance."
An additional rule requires that the students
live at the University-maintained campuses.
In addition, there were changes in the rules
on alcoholic beverages and on guests visiting
students at the campuses. The dress
regulations were abolished. "Open house"
hours were changed. They now correspond to
those at the home campus.
The new rule on drinking proscribes
disorderly conduct which results from the
consumption of alcoholic beverages.
The regulations previously in effect
prohibited the possession or consumption of
hard liquor on any campus overseas.
Before the current rules went into effect.

no visitors were allowed at any campus. From
now on, policies governing this matter are to
be established at each campus "in accordance
with the needs of the various programs, the
available facilities, and the respective
contracts which have been negotiated with
local owners."
The dress regulations which the directors
abolished said: "Students attending an
overseas campus are reminded that standards
of appropriate dress in the countries of
Europe differ markedly from those in the
United States." Then it went on to designate
the proper dress for meals, classes, and guest
lectures.
Since 1968, the rule on open house hours
has read: "No men are permitted in women's
quarters and women may not enter men's
quarters except between the hours of .5:00
p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. If Friday
is a regularly scheduled day of academic
instruction, these hours may be extended to
that given day." Now, open house hours are,
in general, the same at Stanford campuses
everywhere.
