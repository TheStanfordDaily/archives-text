# Overseas Campuses Rules Altered
## 
### BILL EVERS 
Major changes in the regulations governing
students at the five Stanford overseas
campuses have been put into effect by the
overseas campus directors.
Overseas Campuses rules no longer say that
students must be in residence at the overseas
campus from Sunday night through Friday
morning.
Previously the campus administrations
overseas had enforced this rule, for example,
by checking class attendance Monday
mornings. Exceptions were often granted, in
recent years, to allow students to leave for
weekend journeys on Thursdays.
Now all class attendance requirements are
at the discretion of the instructor, according
to the new regulations adopted by the
overseas campus directors at their Vienna
meeting in early July.
The old "residence" rule said: "All
students enrolled at any one of the Stanford
Overseas Campuses are required to reside at
their campus and to participate in the
academic program, including scheduled

local tours and field trips."
The new rule, which went into effect this
quarter, reads: "All students attending any
one of the Stanford Overseas Campuses are
required to be enrolled in the academic
program, to attend the orientation program,
and to participate in the major field trips of
each group. In accordance with University
policy, individual instructors may include
attendance and participation in class work as
factors in evaluating students' performance."
An additional rule requires that the students
live at the University-maintained campuses.
In addition, there were changes in the rules
on alcoholic beverages and on guests visiting
students at the campuses. The dress
regulations were abolished. "Open house"
hours were changed. They now correspond to
those at the home campus.
The new rule on drinking proscribes
disorderly conduct which results from the
consumption of alcoholic beverages.
The regulations previously in effect
prohibited the possession or consumption of
hard liquor on any campus overseas.
Before the current rules went into effect.

no visitors were allowed at any campus. From
now on, policies governing this matter are to
be established at each campus "in accordance
with the needs of the various programs, the
available facilities, and the respective
contracts which have been negotiated with
local owners."
The dress regulations which the directors
abolished said: "Students attending an
overseas campus are reminded that standards
of appropriate dress in the countries of
Europe differ markedly from those in the
United States." Then it went on to designate
the proper dress for meals, classes, and guest
lectures.
Since 1968, the rule on open house hours
has read: "No men are permitted in women's
quarters and women may not enter men's
quarters except between the hours of .5:00
p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. If Friday
is a regularly scheduled day of academic
instruction, these hours may be extended to
that given day." Now, open house hours are,
in general, the same at Stanford campuses
everywhere.

Overseas Campuses Program Robert
Walker has changed some program
otilac iftpr mmv fitllHont rPflllMfft.
The Overseas Campuses Office
has been under pressure from
students attending campuses
overseas and from alumni of the
overseas program to change
the "residence" requirement.
During last spring, students at
different campuses who were
opposed to the regulations then in
force wrote letters to one another
and attempted to co-ordinate
their efforts to some extent,
campuses overseas and from
alumni of the overseas program to
change the "residence"
requirement. During last spring,
students at different campuses
who were opposed to the
regulations then in force wrote
letters to one another and
attempted to co-ordinate their
efforts to some extent.
In April, Rolland White of
Italy XVII, sent a petition to the
Overseas Campuses Office signed
by members of his Italy group.
The petition stated that
"guidelines for class participation
should be set by the individual
instructors at Overseas Campuses,
and requirements for presence at
the Overseas Campuses should be
the same as those applying to
underclassmen at the home
campus."
Robert Walker, the Director of
the Overseas Campuses program,
replied to the petition, saying the
class attendance rule was
necessary because of the short
academic week at overseas
campuses.
In June, John Hughes,
president of Austria VIII, sent a
six-page letter to Walker. It began:
"Many students in our group are
dissatisfied with the rule requiring
that students be in residence at
the campus and participate in the
academic program . . . The rule is
inconsistent with two basic
principles of the University: first,
that education is primarily a
matter of individual
responsibility; second, that the
rules under which a community
lives should be established by the
members of that community."
Walker, in talking to The Daily,
identified what he considered to
be the "unarticulated major
premise" of the letter: "They [the
students) should make their own
rules." •
Walker told Hughes: "Our
problem is not lack of
acquaintance with student
opinion. It is our inability to
reconcile the already stated views
of some students with the
opinions of others with an equally
valid interest—the local citizens by
whom we are observed, the

Directors, the faculty and
instructors, and those of us who
must be concerned with the long
range success of the Overseas
Campuses as an educational
program in the University."
George R. Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of Overseas Campuses,
also replied to Hughes at length. A
major contention of Hamrdla's
letter is that Hughes should look
beyond the "community" of
students to the larger community
of which the students are only a
subset. Hamrdla asserts that the
Overseas Campuses office must
look out for the interests of this
larger community, which includes
those future students who might
go overseas.
In July, the rules committee of
Germany XXII submitted a
detailed alternative list of rules
and regulations. In a letter to
Walker, they said: "We worked
together with the directors and
the faculty synthesizing guidelines
which could satisfactorily govern
our community, in the context of
one little community, and the
larger one of university
scale ... We have .. . chosen
negotiation and possible
compromise as the way to achieve
our common ends."
Walker told The Daily that
Germany XXII proposal was the
"working document" of the July
directors' conference in Vienna.
The Germany XXII proposal
said that the class attendance rule
"represents an unwarranted
intrusion by the administration
(or other students, if it comes to a
judicial case), on a relationship
between student and instructor."
One suggestion of the Germany
XXII rules committee which was
not adopted was abolition of the
rule prohibiting motorcycles and
motor scooters. The Germany
students argued that "the
University has no right to prohibit
private citizens from purchasing
what is legally personal property."
After the campus directors had
met for two sessions in Vienna
and had considered the
recommendations of Germany
XXII, they held a meeting there
with four students (one each from
Austria, France, Germany, and
Italy).
These students endorsed the
move to abolish the "residence"
rule, but called in addition for
greater opportunity for
independent work.
An open meeting was also held
in the Austria campus auditorium,
in which some students called for
making all rules at the local
campuses.

has been under pressure from
students attending campuses
overseas and from alumni of the
overseas program to change
the "residence" requirement.

opposed to the regulations then in
force wrote letters to one another

campuses overseas and from
alumni of the overseas program to
change the "residence"
requirement. During last spring,
students at different campuses
who were opposed to the
regulations then in force wrote
letters to one another and
attempted to co-ordinate their
efforts to some extent.
In April, Rolland White of
Italy XVII, sent a petition to the
Overseas Campuses Office signed
by members of his Italy group.
The petition stated that
"guidelines for class participation
should be set by the individual
instructors at Overseas Campuses,
and requirements for presence at
the Overseas Campuses should be
the same as those applying to
underclassmen at the home
campus."
Robert Walker, the Director of
the Overseas Campuses program,
replied to the petition, saying the
class attendance rule was
necessary because of the short
academic week at overseas
campuses.
In June, John Hughes,
president of Austria VIII, sent a
six-page letter to Walker. It began:
"Many students in our group are
dissatisfied with the rule requiring
that students be in residence at
the campus and participate in the
academic program . . . The rule is
inconsistent with two basic
principles of the University: first,
that education is primarily a
matter of individual
responsibility; second, that the
rules under which a community
lives should be established by the
members of that community."
Walker, in talking to The Daily,
identified what he considered to
be the "unarticulated major
premise" of the letter: "They [the
students) should make their own
rules." •
Walker told Hughes: "Our
problem is not lack of
acquaintance with student
opinion. It is our inability to
reconcile the already stated views
of some students with the
opinions of others with an equally
valid interest—the local citizens by
whom we are observed, the

Directors, the faculty and
instructors, and those of us who
must be concerned with the long
range success of the Overseas
Campuses as an educational
program in the University."
George R. Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of Overseas Campuses,
also replied to Hughes at length. A
major contention of Hamrdla's
letter is that Hughes should look
beyond the "community" of
students to the larger community
of which the students are only a
subset. Hamrdla asserts that the
Overseas Campuses office must
look out for the interests of this
larger community, which includes
those future students who might
go overseas.
In July, the rules committee of
Germany XXII submitted a
detailed alternative list of rules
and regulations. In a letter to
Walker, they said: "We worked
together with the directors and
the faculty synthesizing guidelines
which could satisfactorily govern
our community, in the context of
one little community, and the
larger one of university
scale ... We have .. . chosen
negotiation and possible
compromise as the way to achieve
our common ends."
Walker told The Daily that
Germany XXII proposal was the
"working document" of the July
directors' conference in Vienna.
The Germany XXII proposal
said that the class attendance rule
"represents an unwarranted
intrusion by the administration
(or other students, if it comes to a
judicial case), on a relationship
between student and instructor."
One suggestion of the Germany
XXII rules committee which was
not adopted was abolition of the
rule prohibiting motorcycles and
motor scooters. The Germany
students argued that "the
University has no right to prohibit
private citizens from purchasing
what is legally personal property."
After the campus directors had
met for two sessions in Vienna
and had considered the
recommendations of Germany
XXII, they held a meeting there
with four students (one each from
Austria, France, Germany, and
Italy).
These students endorsed the
move to abolish the "residence"
rule, but called in addition for
greater opportunity for
independent work.
An open meeting was also held
in the Austria campus auditorium,
in which some students called for
making all rules at the local
campuses.
Major changes in the regulations governing
students at the five Stanford overseas
campuses have been put into effect by the
overseas campus directors.
Overseas Campuses rules no longer say that
students must be in residence at the overseas
campus from Sunday night through Friday
morning.
Previously the campus administrations
overseas had enforced this rule, for example,
by checking class attendance Monday
mornings. Exceptions were often granted, in
recent years, to allow students to leave for
weekend journeys on Thursdays.
Now all class attendance requirements are
at the discretion of the instructor, according
to the new regulations adopted by the
overseas campus directors at their Vienna
meeting in early July.
The old "residence" rule said: "All
students enrolled at any one of the Stanford
Overseas Campuses are required to reside at
their campus and to participate in the
academic program, including scheduled

local tours and field trips."
The new rule, which went into effect this
quarter, reads: "All students attending any
one of the Stanford Overseas Campuses are
required to be enrolled in the academic
program, to attend the orientation program,
and to participate in the major field trips of
each group. In accordance with University
policy, individual instructors may include
attendance and participation in class work as
factors in evaluating students' performance."
An additional rule requires that the students
live at the University-maintained campuses.
In addition, there were changes in the rules
on alcoholic beverages and on guests visiting
students at the campuses. The dress
regulations were abolished. "Open house"
hours were changed. They now correspond to
those at the home campus.
The new rule on drinking proscribes
disorderly conduct which results from the
consumption of alcoholic beverages.
The regulations previously in effect
prohibited the possession or consumption of
hard liquor on any campus overseas.
Before the current rules went into effect.

no visitors were allowed at any campus. From
now on, policies governing this matter are to
be established at each campus "in accordance
with the needs of the various programs, the
available facilities, and the respective
contracts which have been negotiated with
local owners."
The dress regulations which the directors
abolished said: "Students attending an
overseas campus are reminded that standards
of appropriate dress in the countries of
Europe differ markedly from those in the
United States." Then it went on to designate
the proper dress for meals, classes, and guest
lectures.
Since 1968, the rule on open house hours
has read: "No men are permitted in women's
quarters and women may not enter men's
quarters except between the hours of .5:00
p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. If Friday
is a regularly scheduled day of academic
instruction, these hours may be extended to
that given day." Now, open house hours are,
in general, the same at Stanford campuses
everywhere.

the faculty synthesizing guidelines
which could satisfactorily govern
our community, in the context of
one little community, and the
larger one of university
scale ... We have .. . chosen
negotiation and possible
compromise as the way to achieve
our common ends."
Walker told The Daily that
Germany XXII proposal was the
"working document" of the July
directors' conference in Vienna.
The Germany XXII proposal
said that the class attendance rule
"represents an unwarranted
intrusion by the administration
(or other students, if it comes to a
judicial case), on a relationship
between student and instructor."
One suggestion of the Germany
XXII rules committee which was
not adopted was abolition of the
rule prohibiting motorcycles and
motor scooters. The Germany
students argued that "the
University has no right to prohibit
private citizens from purchasing
what is legally personal property."
After the campus directors had
met for two sessions in Vienna
and had considered the
recommendations of Germany
XXII, they held a meeting there
with four students (one each from
Austria, France, Germany, and
Italy).
These students endorsed the
move to abolish the "residence"
rule, but called in addition for
greater opportunity for
independent work.
An open meeting was also held
in the Austria campus auditorium,
in which some students called for
making all rules at the local
campuses.
Major changes in the regulations governing
students at the five Stanford overseas
campuses have been put into effect by the
overseas campus directors.
Overseas Campuses rules no longer say that
students must be in residence at the overseas
campus from Sunday night through Friday
morning.
Previously the campus administrations
overseas had enforced this rule, for example,
by checking class attendance Monday
mornings. Exceptions were often granted, in
recent years, to allow students to leave for
weekend journeys on Thursdays.
Now all class attendance requirements are
at the discretion of the instructor, according
to the new regulations adopted by the
overseas campus directors at their Vienna
meeting in early July.
The old "residence" rule said: "All
students enrolled at any one of the Stanford
Overseas Campuses are required to reside at
their campus and to participate in the
academic program, including scheduled

local tours and field trips."
The new rule, which went into effect this
quarter, reads: "All students attending any
one of the Stanford Overseas Campuses are
required to be enrolled in the academic
program, to attend the orientation program,
and to participate in the major field trips of
each group. In accordance with University
policy, individual instructors may include
attendance and participation in class work as
factors in evaluating students' performance."
An additional rule requires that the students
live at the University-maintained campuses.
In addition, there were changes in the rules
on alcoholic beverages and on guests visiting
students at the campuses. The dress
regulations were abolished. "Open house"
hours were changed. They now correspond to
those at the home campus.
The new rule on drinking proscribes
disorderly conduct which results from the
consumption of alcoholic beverages.
The regulations previously in effect
prohibited the possession or consumption of
hard liquor on any campus overseas.
Before the current rules went into effect.

no visitors were allowed at any campus. From
now on, policies governing this matter are to
be established at each campus "in accordance
with the needs of the various programs, the
available facilities, and the respective
contracts which have been negotiated with
local owners."
The dress regulations which the directors
abolished said: "Students attending an
overseas campus are reminded that standards
of appropriate dress in the countries of
Europe differ markedly from those in the
United States." Then it went on to designate
the proper dress for meals, classes, and guest
lectures.
Since 1968, the rule on open house hours
has read: "No men are permitted in women's
quarters and women may not enter men's
quarters except between the hours of .5:00
p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. If Friday
is a regularly scheduled day of academic
instruction, these hours may be extended to
that given day." Now, open house hours are,
in general, the same at Stanford campuses
everywhere.

The Overseas Campuses Office
has been under pressure from
students attending campuses
overseas and from alumni of the

the "residence" requirement.

who were opposed to the

attempted to co-ordinate their
efforts to some extent.
In April, Rolland White of
Italy XVII, sent a petition to the
Overseas Campuses Office signed
by members of his Italy group.
The petition stated that
"guidelines for class participation
should be set by the individual
instructors at Overseas Campuses,
and requirements for presence at
the Overseas Campuses should be
the same as those applying to
underclassmen at the home
campus."
Robert Walker, the Director of
the Overseas Campuses program,
replied to the petition, saying the
class attendance rule was
necessary because of the short
academic week at overseas
campuses.
In June, John Hughes,
president of Austria VIII, sent a
six-page letter to Walker. It began:
"Many students in our group are
dissatisfied with the rule requiring
that students be in residence at
the campus and participate in the
academic program . . . The rule is
inconsistent with two basic
principles of the University: first,
that education is primarily a
matter of individual
responsibility; second, that the
rules under which a community
lives should be established by the
members of that community."
Walker, in talking to The Daily,
identified what he considered to
be the "unarticulated major
premise" of the letter: "They [the
students) should make their own
rules." •
Walker told Hughes: "Our
problem is not lack of
acquaintance with student
opinion. It is our inability to
reconcile the already stated views
of some students with the
opinions of others with an equally
valid interest—the local citizens by
whom we are observed, the

Directors, the faculty and
instructors, and those of us who
must be concerned with the long
range success of the Overseas
Campuses as an educational
program in the University."
George R. Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of Overseas Campuses,
also replied to Hughes at length. A
major contention of Hamrdla's
letter is that Hughes should look
beyond the "community" of
students to the larger community
of which the students are only a
subset. Hamrdla asserts that the
Overseas Campuses office must
look out for the interests of this
larger community, which includes
those future students who might
go overseas.

hard liquor on any campus overseas.
Before the current rules went into effect.

no visitors were allowed at any campus. From
now on, policies governing this matter are to
be established at each campus "in accordance
with the needs of the various programs, the
available facilities, and the respective
contracts which have been negotiated with
local owners."
The dress regulations which the directors
abolished said: "Students attending an
overseas campus are reminded that standards
of appropriate dress in the countries of
Europe differ markedly from those in the
United States." Then it went on to designate
the proper dress for meals, classes, and guest
lectures.
Since 1968, the rule on open house hours
has read: "No men are permitted in women's
quarters and women may not enter men's
quarters except between the hours of .5:00
p.m. and 11:00 p.m. on Sunday, Monday,
Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. If Friday
is a regularly scheduled day of academic
instruction, these hours may be extended to
that given day." Now, open house hours are,
in general, the same at Stanford campuses
everywhere.


CONCESSION S-Director of the
Overseas Campuses Program Robert
Walker has changed some program
otilac iftpr mmv fitllHont rPflllMfft.
The Overseas Campuses Office
has been under pressure from
students attending campuses
overseas and from alumni of the
overseas program to change
the "residence" requirement.
During last spring, students at
different campuses who were
opposed to the regulations then in
force wrote letters to one another
and attempted to co-ordinate
their efforts to some extent,
campuses overseas and from
alumni of the overseas program to
change the "residence"
requirement. During last spring,
students at different campuses
who were opposed to the
regulations then in force wrote
letters to one another and
attempted to co-ordinate their
efforts to some extent.
In April, Rolland White of
Italy XVII, sent a petition to the
Overseas Campuses Office signed
by members of his Italy group.
The petition stated that
"guidelines for class participation
should be set by the individual
instructors at Overseas Campuses,
and requirements for presence at
the Overseas Campuses should be
the same as those applying to
underclassmen at the home
campus."
Robert Walker, the Director of
the Overseas Campuses program,
replied to the petition, saying the
class attendance rule was
necessary because of the short
academic week at overseas
campuses.
In June, John Hughes,
president of Austria VIII, sent a
six-page letter to Walker. It began:
"Many students in our group are
dissatisfied with the rule requiring
that students be in residence at
the campus and participate in the
academic program . . . The rule is
inconsistent with two basic
principles of the University: first,
that education is primarily a
matter of individual
responsibility; second, that the
rules under which a community
lives should be established by the
members of that community."
Walker, in talking to The Daily,
identified what he considered to
be the "unarticulated major
premise" of the letter: "They [the
students) should make their own
rules." •
Walker told Hughes: "Our
problem is not lack of
acquaintance with student
opinion. It is our inability to
reconcile the already stated views
of some students with the
opinions of others with an equally
valid interest—the local citizens by
whom we are observed, the

Directors, the faculty and
instructors, and those of us who
must be concerned with the long
range success of the Overseas
Campuses as an educational
program in the University."
George R. Hamrdla, Assistant
Director of Overseas Campuses,
also replied to Hughes at length. A
major contention of Hamrdla's
letter is that Hughes should look
beyond the "community" of
students to the larger community
of which the students are only a
subset. Hamrdla asserts that the
Overseas Campuses office must
look out for the interests of this
larger community, which includes
those future students who might
go overseas.
In July, the rules committee of
Germany XXII submitted a
detailed alternative list of rules
and regulations. In a letter to
Walker, they said: "We worked
together with the directors and
the faculty synthesizing guidelines
which could satisfactorily govern
our community, in the context of
one little community, and the
larger one of university
scale ... We have .. . chosen
negotiation and possible
compromise as the way to achieve
our common ends."
Walker told The Daily that
Germany XXII proposal was the
"working document" of the July
directors' conference in Vienna.
The Germany XXII proposal
said that the class attendance rule
"represents an unwarranted
intrusion by the administration
(or other students, if it comes to a
judicial case), on a relationship
between student and instructor."
One suggestion of the Germany
XXII rules committee which was
not adopted was abolition of the
rule prohibiting motorcycles and
motor scooters. The Germany
students argued that "the
University has no right to prohibit
private citizens from purchasing
what is legally personal property."
After the campus directors had
met for two sessions in Vienna
and had considered the
recommendations of Germany
XXII, they held a meeting there
with four students (one each from
Austria, France, Germany, and
Italy).
These students endorsed the
move to abolish the "residence"
rule, but called in addition for
greater opportunity for
independent work.
An open meeting was also held
in the Austria campus auditorium,
in which some students called for
making all rules at the local
campuses.
