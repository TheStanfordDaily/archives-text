## Computers And Privacy 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The Computer ranks with writing and the
printing press as a major extension of the human
brain. Like its forerunners, it also stands at the crux
of a social crisis expressed in terms like "the death
of privacy." The first written records must have
evoked a reaction of superstitious awe and
exultation similar to that now inspired by computer
management of data.
If people today still have an exaggerated belief in
what they see in print, they often place an even
higher credibility on computer printouts. The data
may be worthless or even intentionally manipulated,
but so long as the machine remains so mysterious,
its products will be improperly and uncritically
judged simply for having come from a computer.
An unfortunate by-product of this aura of
mystery is a tendency to make the computer a
scapegoat for social ills that stem from human
venality. In fact, no tangible evidence supports the
fear that the processing of personal data by
computers makes political witch-hunts more likely.
The only help that Hitler could have had from
computers would have been to reduce the
administrative costs of butchery. It is our social and
political traditions, and our system of freedom
under law, that need our attention more than any
particular piece of technology available to a
government.
For example, Gov. Ronald Reagan has just
vetoed a bill to extend the privilege of legal
confidence to professions like marriage counseling
and psychicatric social work. His grounds were that
law enforcement in California might be impeded, if,
say, a marriage counselor could refuse to testify in
court about information he had received from his
clients. Legal protection for the privacy of the most
intimate communications deserves a much higher
priority than the potential abuses of more efficient
statistical services.
Many citizens harbor a barely conscious
resentment of computer systems that make it harder
to cheat on income tax returns. This resentment will
not survive reflection on fair taxation in a
democratic society. However, we do have real cause

for concern about the extent to which our
compulsory tax returns (computerized or not) can
be made available to other investigative bodies
without our knowledge and for purposes unrelated
to tax administration. If there are social merits in an
annual registration that goes beyond the collection
of taxes, let this be freely and openly discussed—and
let us all know the rules of the game.
Meanwhile, the covert exchange of data on
individuals has generated wide unease about the
collection of vital statistical information for the
census and other operations. This is in the face of
the historical evidence that the Census Bureau has a
spotless record in following its legal mandate of
protecting the confidence of individual data even
against strong pressures from other government
agencies.
These traditions of the Census Bureau are the
strongest assurance that the law of confidence will
continue to be upheld despire the more dubious
history of wiretapping and similar intrusions by
other executive agencies.
One further step might be to remove the Bureau
from the Executive Branch, where it is theoretically
subject to presidential orders that are beyond the
reach of the courts. The census could be delegated
to a public corporation whose policies and practices
in collecting, protecting and collating information
could be governed by a law that would give
individuals a standing they do not now have in
potential grievances about abuse of privacy by the
central government.
Such a corporation would also be governed by a
board of private citizens who could give a unique
assurance of integrity and impartiality in its
operations. Within such a legal framework, we might
justify the confidence of individual citizens in the
degree of centralization of statistical data that we
badly need for assessing and planning our complex
society.

higher credibility on computer printouts. The data
may be worthless or even intentionally manipulated,
but so long as the machine remains so mysterious,
its products will be improperly and uncritically
judged simply for having come from a computer.
An unfortunate by-product of this aura of
mystery is a tendency to make the computer a
scapegoat for social ills that stem from human
venality. In fact, no tangible evidence supports the
fear that the processing of personal data by
computers makes political witch-hunts more likely.
The only help that Hitler could have had from
computers would have been to reduce the
administrative costs of butchery. It is our social and
political traditions, and our system of freedom
under law, that need our attention more than any
particular piece of technology available to a
government.
For example, Gov. Ronald Reagan has just
vetoed a bill to extend the privilege of legal
confidence to professions like marriage counseling
and psychicatric social work. His grounds were that
law enforcement in California might be impeded, if,
say, a marriage counselor could refuse to testify in
court about information he had received from his
clients. Legal protection for the privacy of the most
intimate communications deserves a much higher
priority than the potential abuses of more efficient
statistical services.
Many citizens harbor a barely conscious
resentment of computer systems that make it harder
to cheat on income tax returns. This resentment will
not survive reflection on fair taxation in a
democratic society. However, we do have real cause

for concern about the extent to which our
compulsory tax returns (computerized or not) can
be made available to other investigative bodies
without our knowledge and for purposes unrelated
to tax administration. If there are social merits in an
annual registration that goes beyond the collection
of taxes, let this be freely and openly discussed—and
let us all know the rules of the game.
Meanwhile, the covert exchange of data on
individuals has generated wide unease about the
collection of vital statistical information for the
census and other operations. This is in the face of
the historical evidence that the Census Bureau has a
spotless record in following its legal mandate of
protecting the confidence of individual data even
against strong pressures from other government
agencies.
These traditions of the Census Bureau are the
strongest assurance that the law of confidence will
continue to be upheld despire the more dubious
history of wiretapping and similar intrusions by
other executive agencies.
One further step might be to remove the Bureau
from the Executive Branch, where it is theoretically
subject to presidential orders that are beyond the
reach of the courts. The census could be delegated
to a public corporation whose policies and practices
in collecting, protecting and collating information
could be governed by a law that would give
individuals a standing they do not now have in
potential grievances about abuse of privacy by the
central government.
Such a corporation would also be governed by a
board of private citizens who could give a unique
assurance of integrity and impartiality in its
operations. Within such a legal framework, we might
justify the confidence of individual citizens in the
degree of centralization of statistical data that we
badly need for assessing and planning our complex
society.

The Computer ranks with writing and the
printing press as a major extension of the human
brain. Like its forerunners, it also stands at the crux
of a social crisis expressed in terms like "the death
of privacy." The first written records must have
evoked a reaction of superstitious awe and
exultation similar to that now inspired by computer
management of data.
If people today still have an exaggerated belief in
what they see in print, they often place an even
higher credibility on computer printouts. The data
may be worthless or even intentionally manipulated,
but so long as the machine remains so mysterious,
its products will be improperly and uncritically
