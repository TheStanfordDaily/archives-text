# Have I Ever Lied To You?
## An American In Rome 
### Art Buchwald 
The big mistake was taking my wife to Rome in
the first place. Any American husband in his right
mind should know better than to bring his spouse to
Italy, particularly for the first time. But I
underestimated the Italians, which is kind of hard to
do.
It all started when my wife came back to the
Excelsior Hotel from a shopping trip to the Via
Condotti. She had a big grin on her face.
"What's so funny?" I wanted to know.
"Three Italians flirted with me on the st <»et
today," she said, pleased with herself.
"Well, don't let it go to your head," I warn d
her. "They flirt with everybody."
"Don't be too sure," she said. "Besides, thv;
Roman men make you feel like you're really a
woman."
"I make you feel like you're a woman, too," I
said angrily.
"Did you ever call me blue eyes?" she wanted to
know.
"No, and for a very simple reason. You don t
have blue eyes."
