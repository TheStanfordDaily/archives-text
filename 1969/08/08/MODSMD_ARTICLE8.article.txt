To The Editor:
Someone has just brought to my attention a
story published in your paper on Tuesday, July 1, in
which Marc Weiss set forth what purported to be a
verbatim account of a conversation between the two
of us.
It is a highly inaccurate reportâ€”in fact, parts of it
are wholly fictional.
1 cannot understand the conception of
journalism that would permit you to publish such
an account. Did the thought not cross your mind
that the recounting of an argument by one of the
protagonists might not be wholly objective and
should be checked with the other?

"That's not the point. Even if they lie, they do it
beautifully. I think Italian men are wonderful."
I decided to drop the subject before I really lost
my temper. But the next day, after another
shopping tour, there she stood with the same smile
on her face.
"OK," I said, "what happened today?"
"A traffic policeman stopped all the traffic on
the Via Veneto so I could cross the street."
"Big deal," I said. "It so happens that traffic
policemen are supposed to stop traffic so people can
cross the street. That's their job."'
"When the light is green?" she asked. "Then, as I
crossed, he tipped his hat and all the cars were
blowing their horns. It's never happened to me in
any other city."
"Of course, it hasn't. In most cities traffic cops
are trying to save people's lives," I said.
"Don't be so smart," she said. "If you want
further proof that Italian men really care, this
morning I ordered a coffee at Doney's and the
waiter couldn't have been nicer."
"So what? Some waiters are nice. What does that
prove?"
"Nothing, except he picked up the check."
She was getting impossible, and the next
afternoon I was afraid to come back to the room.
The smile was waiting for me.
"I know," I said. "You went to Bulgari's and the
salesman gave you a diamond necklace free."
"Nothing that dramatic," she said. "But a taxi
driver asked me to go dancing with him tonight."
"Wait a minute. You don't speak Italian. How do
you know he asked you to go dancing tonight?
"He held up his hands as if he holding
somebody in them and he hummed a waltz."
"What's so great about that?"
"The cab was moving while he did it."
There was nothing I could say to that, so I tried
to walk out of the room.
"I think you're absolutely terrible," she said.
"Everyone has been so nice and all you want to do
is to throw cold water on me. American men just
don't know how to appreciate 3 woman."
"Is that so?" I said. "Well, it so happens I have a
cousin who went up to a girl on Fifth Ave. in New
York and told her she had the most beautiful figure
he had even seen, and he's now doing 20 years in
Sing Sing. Since then, I've kept my thoughts to
myself."
