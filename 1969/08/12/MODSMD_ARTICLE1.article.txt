# Revised ROTC Sought
## 
### BILL EVERS 
The Stanford administration is negotiating with the Army,
Navy, and Air Force in order to keep a Reserve Officer Training
Corps program here.
Stanford President Kenneth S. Pitzer told a Commonwealth
Club section meeting one week ago that the University was
making progress on a new contract with the Army, but was
having trouble with the Navy and the Air Force, because the new
contracts must conform to the ground rules established by the
Academic Senate of Stanford's faculty last February.
It was Pitzer's opinion that the difficulty with the Navy and
the Air Force stemmed from the desire of those services for
career officers rather than reserve officers.
In February, the faculty representatives decided to abolish
academic credit for ROTC starting with Stanford's 1970
freshman class. At the time, Prof. Lyman P. Van Slyke of the
history department said that the recommendation of the majority
of the faculty's study committee on ROTC saw "as acceptable
the continuation of ROTC scholarships, of voluntary on-campus
activities, and of off-campus and summer training."
The University is now negotiating a new contract with the
Department of Defense. It is quite possible that a new revamped
Army ROTC program will be approved by this fall, if unhappy
congressmen can be placated.
A University spokesman told The Daily that since the Army
began circulating its new plan, "there have been signs of
congressional opposition. But every effort has been made by
Army officials and civilian educators to persuade those opposed."
Other sources indicate that opposition to the plan is
concentrated in Representative F-. Edward Herbert's
subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee.
According to an article in the June 20 Christian Science
Monitor the new Army ROTC program, available for American
universities and colleges in 1970, includes major changes.
Required hours of instruction and training will be reduced
from 480 to 360 as a required minimum. But those 360 can be
evenly divided between military instruction and training of a
professional nature and elective courses agreed upon locally.
Increased flexibility will be allowed each college and
university. There is to be much greater decentralization of
control, with the professor of military science given broad powers
in working with faculty and administration to set up acceptable
programs.
The Army is willing to go so far as to give up drill, weapons,
and uniforms on campus where there is strong, organized
discontent over ROTC.
