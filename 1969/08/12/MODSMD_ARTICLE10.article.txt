# Tickets Are Now Available for Sunday's Rock Concert
## 
### 
The summer's biggest rock
concert will come to Frost
Amphitheater on Sunday with
seven bands.
Tickets are now on sale at $2
during the noon hour outside the
Bookstore. The Midpeninsula Free
University office on El Camino
Real in Menlo Park is also selling
tickets.
Sons A' Champlin heads the
bill for the six-hour concert,
which begins at 12:30. Country
Weather, Cold Blood, Sunbayr,

Lamb, Congress of Wonders and
Stone Rock Outcrop will also
play.
Artists and rock freaks from
the Midpeninsula Free University
are producing the show. All
proceeds go to the Stanford
Committee on Radical Education
(SCORE) for on-campus use.
SCORE has explained that the
$2 donation is needed because of
heavy financial pressure on the
organization and its members.
Many SCORE members, for

instance, were among the 103
students arrested by Palo Alto
police for protesting war research
at SRI in May. The police and
district attorney have tied up
more than $40,000 in bail money,
and legal expenses to protect the
students from political
persecution will exceed $20,000.
