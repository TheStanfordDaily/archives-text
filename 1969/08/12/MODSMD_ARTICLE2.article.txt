# Mexican-American Named To Dean Of Students Office
## 
### 
A Mexican-American, who will
coordinate Chicano student
relations at Stanford, will join the
Dean of Students office
September 1, it was announced
Friday.
The new assistant dean,
26-year-old Felix Guiterrez, is
now public information officer
for EYOA, an unbrella-type
organization that coordinates
youth activities in Los Angeles
County.
"Part of my job," Guiterrez
said in a campus interview Friday,
"will be to help awaken the
community to the problems of
the Spanish surname people and
to work with the Stanford chapter
of MECHA (Movimiento
Estudiantil Chicano de Aztlan),
formerly the Mexican-American
Student Confederation.
He expects there will be some
special problems among new
Chicano students because of
Stanford's "upper middle-class
white" orientation—but, he
conceded, not as many as there
might be if Stanford were public
instead of private.
Guiterrez expressed surprise at
the intensity of Stanford's
far-flung efforts to recruit
Chicano students. He noted that
th»' neighboring San Jose area has
one of the largest
lexican-American population
When a situation demands
nilitancy, Guiterrez said, he feels

believes in separatism because of
national characteristics and
language differences.
He feels separatism should
extend to the Mexican-American
communities because of the
apparently unbridgeable gulf of
prejudice and hostility of the
Anglo (white) population.
"We should have our own
hospitals, schools and police
force," he told a group of

reporters.
He is especially opposed to the
"tracking" systems in elementary
and secondary educational
systems, because it sells Chicano
students short. "There are many
more Chicanos who are able to
handle a college course, but they
are shunted aside because of the
language barrier and prejudices,"
he said.
