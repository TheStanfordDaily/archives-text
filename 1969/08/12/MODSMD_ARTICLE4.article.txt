# Electronics Conference
## Rambo Attacks A3M 
### YALE BRAUNSTEIN 
The first session of the
twenty-second annual Stanford
Electronics Research Review
featured a presentation billed as
the ''University Research
Program" by Professor W.R.
Rambo, director of the Stanford
Electronics Laboratories (SEL),
that became a political
show-and-tell.
In a urbane talk accompanied
by carefully selected slides,
Rambo gave his view of the
activities of this past spring and of
the April Third Movement. He

started by telling his largely
sympathetic audience of 200
engineers and physicists that the
Stanford Techniques Laboratory
(a part of SEL) has done "major
electronic warfare studies" and
finished with "you will be happy
to know that programs leaving the
university will not be lost"—an
apparent reference to the possible
shift of classified projects from
the university to Stanford
Research Institute (SRI).
Three years ago ("a more
rational time" according to
Rambo) the SEL research
program was given a "clean bill of
health" by the university.
However this year attacks on
classified studies and electronic
warfare research started. It was
Rambo's opinion that by
themselves these criticisms of his
laboratories had no support.
"Then in a masterful tactical
move, the leaders broadened the
movement to be against classified
research, war, and freshman
English," explained Rambo. As a
result this enabled several
thousand students to join the
movement and participate in the
nine day sit-in in the Applied
Electronics Lab, the home of the
Systems Techniques Laboratory.
The exact chain of logic that
ended in so many students being
duped was never explained, and
since no questions were allowed,
it was not clarified. The issue of
SRI and its relationship to the
university was not mentioned.
By Rambo's account the sit-in
was characterized "by endless
meetings run by what was called
participatory democracy but what
was actually manipulatory
democracy. It consisted of
thievery, pillage, and vandalism."
While showing a slide of the
SEL printing press, Rambo called
the April Third Movement printed
matter "outlandish propaganda on
stolen paper." He also showed a
slide of students in the AEL
hallways reading The Daily, which
he said "was designed to provide
joy to the people."
His conclusion was in two
parts—one dealing with the sit-in
and the other with research

policy. In answer to his own
question of "Why don't we throw
the bastards out? he replied "the
university is different from
outside communities.
"The unhappy part is that the
Academic Senate met in a highly
emotional state and decided the
classified research program would
end. Stanford was different in
allowing this research at a
university. In moving toward
conformity with other
universities, we could be moving
toward mediocrity."
The audience for Rambo's talk
was largely composed of
from local industry, attending the
two-day conference designed to
familiarize them with Stanford's
research program.
On Wednesday and Thursday,
the conference, including
Rambo's presentation, will be
rerun for an audience of
government scientists associated
with the agencies contracting with
the electronics labs. The sessions
are open to the public.
A radical who was present at
Monday's session, handing out
copies of the April Third
Movement's "The Goods on
AEL," told The Daily : "People
concerned about the continuation
of warfare research at Stanford
are coming to Rambo's talk at
nine o'clock Wednesday morning
in the Physics tank to give the
scientists a more life-like
impression of student unrest."
