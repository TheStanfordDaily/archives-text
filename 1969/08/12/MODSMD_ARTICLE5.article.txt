A fight which erupted
Saturday night during a free music
concert in The Plaza (formerly
Lytton Plaza) has developed into
a minor controversy between the
Palo Alto Times and the concert's

was interrupted by police almost

more than several minutes, was
described by the Times as a
"melee."

rape of a 17-year-old Redwood
City girl, which her father
reported to police the following
day. The incident was supposed to

the rape charge "looks like kind

the girl proved negative, and
accounts of what happened to the
girl were conflicting, according to

The Saturday night concerts on
Lytton Plaza have been held

consisting mainly of Free
University members and local high
hool students.
The Times account called the
event "an unauthorized rock
