# Controversy Arises Over Plaza Dance
## 
### 
A fight which erupted
Saturday night during a free music
concert in The Plaza (formerly
Lytton Plaza) has developed into
a minor controversy between the
Palo Alto Times and the concert's
organizers.
Yesterday's Times printed a
story about the incident which
many non-police observers feel is
grossly misleading.
The fighting incident, which
was interrupted by police almost
as soon as it began and lasted no
more than several minutes, was
described by the Times as a
"melee."
The paper's report also gave
prominent play to the purported
rape of a 17-year-old Redwood
City girl, which her father
reported to police the following
day. The incident was supposed to
have occurred in a vacant lot near
the Poppycock after the girl left
The Plaza concert.
Police last night reported that
the rape charge "looks like kind
of a farce." The medical report on
the girl proved negative, and
accounts of what happened to the
girl were conflicting, according to
the Palo Alto police.
The Saturday night concerts on
Lytton Plaza have been held
weekly this summer and last, and
are organized by the Free People s
Free Music Company, a group
consisting mainly of Free
University members and local high
hool students.

Police spokesmen have told the
Music Company that they will be
allowed to have the concerts until
complaints are registered about
the noise level or other
d is t u rbances.
At no time has there been any
indication that the concerts
themselves were illegal or that
authorization was needed,
according to concert organizers.
The Times did not indicate
what authorization was required.
It said that Equitable Savings and
Loan, which owns The Plaza, has
a rule prohibiting the use of the
plaza by more than 25 persons at
one time. Police have not tried to
enforce this company rule this
year at the concerts.
The Times quotes James
Kemp, managing officer of the
Equitable office in Palo Alto, as
saying that he had written to the
police Friday "giving them
permission to make arrests in The

There will be another dance in
