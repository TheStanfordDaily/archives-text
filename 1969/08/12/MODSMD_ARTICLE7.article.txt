# Sounds Like Summer
## Jazz By The Bay 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
Quality music in the Bay Area
certainly will not end with the
Summer Festival, and those of us
fortunate enough to be remaining
around here through September
can look forward to some exciting
sounds. The Concord Summer
Festival takes place the last week
in August, presenting six evenings
of great jazz and some reasonable
classical. Then September sees the
opening of the Monterey Jazz
Festival (in its twelfth year) with
another set of jazz artists.
Appreciators of good jazz will
have much to choose from.
The Concord Festival opens
Tuesday evening, August 26, in
the town of Concord, just north
of San Francisco. Featured will be
Erroll Garner, jazz pianist, with

his rhythm section; Laurindo
Almeida, the jazz-bossa
nova-classical guitarist; and
rock-jazz from the Third Wave
accompanied by the George Duke
Trio. The next evening, the
Romero family (Spanish guitar
quartet), Vince Guaraldi Trio
(fantastic Bay Area jazzmen), and
Amici Delia Musica (Bay Area
chamber orchestra of nationwide
renown) will appear.
Thursday evening, August 28,
Lalo Schifrin leads the Oakland
Symphony in three of his own
compositions and several others.
Included will be the world
premiere of Schifrin's
Improvisations for Jazz Soloists
and Symphony Orchestra, with
Jean Luc Ponty (violin), Tom
Scott (reeds), and Gary Barone

(trumpet), joining the Symphony.
Then the George Duke Trio will
join the Symphony and the three
jazz soloists for Schifrin's Blues
for Johann Sebastian let me just
say that I consider him and Dave
Brubeckthe two members of the
class of Greatest Jazzmen, as
composers, arrangers, and jazz
pianists. (You have probably
heard Schifrin without realizing
it~he composed and played the
theme of Mission: Impossible,
which is also on the program.)
Latin Jazz with the Cal Tjader
Quintet, the 8010 Sete Trio, and
the Willie Bobo Sextet, and the
north-of-the-border sound of Stan
Kenton's Orchestra make Friday
night's program the biggest and
flashiest. These are all well-known
groups, both as recording stars
and for their personal
appearances. Kenton is a fine
arranger, and has done some
marvelous things with imaginative
instrumentation—such as filling
out the brass section with
mellaphoniums. Tjader is the
unquestioned king of the vibes,
and is backed up by a very good
group. Friday's concert promises
to be the highlight of the Festival.
Saturday, August 30, sees the
return of George Duke, along with
the Don Ellis Big Band, and
Carmen Mcßae and her Trio. This
concert, and all previous, begin at
8:30 p.m. Sunday evening's
program, with the Buddy Rich
Band, vocalist Mel Torme, and
Shelly Manne Quintet (Drummer's
night—Rich and Manne are the
two best jazz percussionists
playing today), begins at 7:30
p.m.
The Concord Summer Festival
will be the biggest treat in years
for jazz lovers—six evenings of
dessert. Write to Concord for
tickets—unreserved seats on the
grass go for $3.00, a bargain at
twice the price. See you there.
Next issue: So what will
Monterey do for an encore?
