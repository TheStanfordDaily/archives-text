# A 						Conspiracy Of One
## The 						Negev Grippe 
### Dan Snell 
The Negev, Israel—My first
week in Israel as a student
preparing to enter the Hebrew
University has been spent learning
the script Hebrew alphabet and
being very sick with the "Negev
grippe." This latter malady is not
quite so flexible as the former.

It involves a fever of up to 103
degrees F. and a tedious pain in
the throat that makes swallowing
unpleasant. Two of my
roommates at the Hebrew school
here had bouts of varying
magnitude with the disease. And
when I had it, I also had a
collision with the problem of not
being able to speak the language
here.
When I first felt sick I tried to
resist the idea of turning myself in
to the infirmary, but one morning
I almost fainted after having
shaved only the right side of my
face. Perhaps my face was
unusually ugly that morning, but I
went to see the nurse here.
The nurse spoke six languages,
but "veery leetle Anglit." But I
slept most of the day until the
doctor came in the evening. A
grave big man with a bald head
and sunglasses, he judiciously
tapped my body for long minutes.
Finally he said something to
me in Hebrew.
"Be-vageshah be-Anglit," I
said, wittily asking him to say
what he had said in English.
"B'reet," he said. I didn't
know what that meant. But at the
time I was breathing, so he said,
"boot." So I surmised that he
wanted me to breathe deeply
whenever he said what he said in
Hebrew.
Next he stood me up to look
down my throat. First there was
the issue of what to do with my
tongue. He mumbled something
using the Hebrew word for
tongue—which I had just learned
the day before.
"Lo, 10, lo," he said, meaning I
shouldn't do that. So I kept it
inside my mouth while he jabbed
a little stick down my throat.
After a minute he allowed me
to slump back on my bed, and he

turned to the nurse. There was a
hard and fast interchange in
Hebrew.
Now it is true that there are
many English terms in Hebrew,
but I recognized none in this little
colloquy that was deciding my
fate. And modern Hebrew when
spoken has so many harsh sounds
that any exchange sounds to the
English ear like an argument.
Finally the doctor turned to
me, "Penicillin you have?
I said I hadn't had any.
He frowned. "Alergic in it? he
asked.
I allowed as how I wasn't.
He snapped a command to the
nurse and walked briskly out of
the room with an airy, "Shalom."
"Injection," beamed the nurse
to me.
"Shalom," I whispered weakly
after the doctor, by this time well
into the dust of the Negev.
