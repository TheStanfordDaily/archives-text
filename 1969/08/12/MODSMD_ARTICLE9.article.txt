## The 						Joffrey Ballet 
### LARRY FRIEDLANDER 
Once upon a time, in the
squalid but important
never-never-city called New York,
two giants stood nose to nose in
Frustration and Impasse (an urban
intersection), terrorizing the
locals. The prize they sought was
the tiny but fair princess called
the dance audience (she was long
supposed to be mythical, but
actually made a public appearance
in the post-war era). One giant
was of mixed origin, mainly
rooshian and fancy french, and his
name was Balanchine. He was
worshipped both by the Elegant
Discerning and the Reactionary
Snob, who came together in
uneasy alliance. The other giant
was pure American, he had many
heads, each of which called itself
the modern dance. He was only
worshipped by himself, but he
was growing heads daily, and so
was a formidable opponent. Each
giant believed in compromise,

artistic freedom, and change, and
each thought the other a liar.
After a long dull period, while
everyone grew dreadfully bored
and fairly rich, a young prince
crept into the city and stole the
princess. His name was Joffrey.
So much for Eastern myth.
Now a rag-to-riches story from the
Old West. Three years ago the
Joffrey Ballet played at the
Stanford Festival. Natives were
suspicious but curious. You could
get good seats fifteen minutes
before performance. This year,
the entire week of performances
was sold out months in advance.
What hath Joffrey wrought?
For the sophisticated dance world
of the east, he was a third world
movement, destroying old
rigidities by artfully and casually
bystepping ideological alliances,
creating a brilliant new and
eclectic theater which absorbed
the best of the current scene.
American dance in the post-war
period was opulently inventive
and technically brilliant. This
country both bred such great
pioneers as Graham, Humphry,
Limon, Cunningham, whose dance
ideas still dominate much of the
avant-garde, and refined the
traditions of European classicism,
especially in the extraordinarily
complex musical fantasies of the
original City-Center group under
Balanchine. Joffrey did not
innovate.
There was enough matter
there. He reassembled,
refurbished, theatricalized those
elements, fusing them into a fresh,
deceptively simple style of
movement, new, vigorous, clearly
American.
Our dance, like our music, is
best when it is jazzy, open, freely
improvised, and muscular. The
public first turned on, in a major
way to this gymnastic soul style in
Robbin's choreography for
West-Side Story. Joffrey distills
these strengths borrowing not so
much the themes and specific
stylistic idiosyncrasies of Graham,
Robbins, or Ballanchine, as their
sense of clean cool movement.

vitalized but lucid space,
unromantic physical exuberance.
He knows how to use other
people's work, how to pick and
choose at the common bargain
counter. But he always knows
how to keep it together, held in
by his feeling for American style,
American bodies, and American
audiences.
The company is presenting
seven ballets new to the west
coast, and they are a mongrel
selection. Two ballets by the great
nineteenth century Danish
choreographer, Bouronville, a new
satirical piece by Britain's
Ashton, three works by Joffrey's
main choreographer, Gerald
Arpino, and "Moves" an
interesting offering by Robbins,
which will be danced in silence,
without props or costumes. In
addition, "Olympics," an all-male
acrobatic fling, influenced 1 think
by Graham's study of athletic
movement; ''Clowns," a
multi-media parable; and I
"Astarte," Joffrey's famous j
mod-rock seduction piece, which !
made it to the cover of Time; all I
repeated from last year's
repertory.
What holds this all together?
Certainly the quality of the i
dancers, trained by Joffrey i
himself in one of the best schools
of dance in America. Joffrey's
skill as a teacher and
administrator is central to his
achievement. From the beginning
he attracted dancers who
otherwise might have drifted into
the chaotic but artistically
exciting world of modern dance.
He kept them for ballet, and used
their inventiveness and freedom to
create a new style of dance. And
it is this eclectic but lucid style
which reconciles the bewildering
variety of his repertory. That, and
a firm, almost cunning,
theatricality, which milks each
piece for everything it has got. j
Not all the ballets are good; I
doubt if any single one is great;
but the final effect is masterful.
