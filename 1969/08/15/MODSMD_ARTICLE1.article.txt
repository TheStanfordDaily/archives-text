# Draft On Benefits Faces Opposition
## 
### BILL EVERS 
A tentative proposal which
would place the net revenues from
student-run benefit shows in a
*und which disburses money to all
student organizations faces
organized opposition in several
quarters.
The suggestion comes in a
paragraph on page 22 of a draft
policy manual for the Committee
of Public Exercises.
It reads: "Income in excess of
expenditures (net profit) shall be
returned to the University or the
ASSU and placed in a general
operating fund for the benefit of
all organizations sharing resources
in this fund."
The manual is being circulated
by the Office of Public Events in
order to receive revisions, advice,
and consent from various
University constituencies.
The proposal on benefits is
subject to revision, either in part
or in full. The Office of Public
Events is apparently aware of the
rising discontent and is
considering the objections being
raised. It looks as if the
Committee on Public Exercises
will be unable to complete its
review of the policy before fall
quarter.
Threatens VIA
Gunnar Erickson of the
Volunteers in Asia program told
The Daily that VIA has scheduled
a fall quarter film series, but
cannot make a commitment on
taking the films until VIA knows
what the policy will be. Erickson
added:
"The Committee on Public
Exercises is considering
eliminating student benefits. The

rationale is that facilities are
overcrowded, but instead of
establishing a reasonable system
of priorities for allotting facility
use, they propose choking out
student organizations which rely
on income from film series and
benefits.
"Whatever the motives, the
impact is political. Lights out on

"Anybody in this university
who seriously believes that more
policies and regulations will solve
any problems or make life at
Stanford better is a master of
self-deception.
Tim Coburn of SCORE and the
Mid peninsula Free University,
who has dealt extensively with the
Office of Public Events this
summer, offered these criticisms:
"Formalized policies are
designed primarily to protect the
status quo and according to
trustee John Gardner are a sign of
decaying institutions in a decaying
society.
"There is no indication that
the ten thousand students at
Stanford are willing to peacefully
decay by smothering themselves
in a plethora of bureaucratic

regulations.
"Indeed, the only useful new
policy I can suggest is that all
administrative appointments on
this campus, including President,
should be reviewed every three or
four years.
"Such a policy would make the
rest of this crud unnecessary and
ridiculous."
Michael Sweeney, former
editor of The Daily and now with
The Chapparal, commented:
"As a basic principle, people
should be free to use University
facilities at any time for any
purpose. I don't understand why
there should be so many
restrictions on this freedom. My
suggestion is that the Committee
on Public Exercises hold public
hearings on the issue this fall."
Barry Askinas, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents
indicated in his comments to The
Daily that he felt the traditional
student opportunity to raise funds
in this way was valuable and
ought to be preserved. Askinas
could see an argument for some of
the profits going to the ASSU or
the University, but he believed
that the suggested policy, if
implemented would end many
student activities at Stanford and
destroy fund-raising initiative.
Pat Shea, another member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents
told The Daily last night that his
"initial reaction" to this
paragraph in the preliminary form
of the new policy was that it had
been "poorly drafted." Shea
considers the substance of the
suggested paragraph on benefits to
be out of the traditional context
in which student voluntary groups
have been able to operate. He
fears that putting into effect this

suggested change on benefits
would take away student initiative
in developing ways to fund their
own programs.
Shea, along with others who
are providing the Office of Public
Events with feedback on the
proposals contained in the draft
of the new policy, plans to send
Tom Bacchetti, the Director of
Public Events, a written
commentary on the matter. He
and Michael Sweeney also intend
to visit Bacchetti next week to
discuss with him whether public
hearings in the fall will be needed.
Paul Rupert of the Resistance

provided a political perspective on
the control of public activities at
Stanford. He sa id:*
"I suspect it's tHo University's
attempt to cut into the resources
of radical and other student
groups. As this spring showed, the
control of resources—buildings or
space, presses, other forms of
money/property—is crucial to
political control of the University.
We don't have much, but we
turned what little we had into
power. So they want to take that
away. The liberal facade will be
disappearing this year."

definitely have to cut back its
programs if the blackout goes into
effect."
"Anybody in this university
who seriously believes that more
policies and regulations will solve
any problems or make life at
Stanford better is a master of
self-deception.
Tim Coburn of SCORE and the
Mid peninsula Free University,
who has dealt extensively with the
Office of Public Events this
summer, offered these criticisms:
"Formalized policies are
designed primarily to protect the
status quo and according to
trustee John Gardner are a sign of
decaying institutions in a decaying
society.
"There is no indication that
the ten thousand students at
Stanford are willing to peacefully
decay by smothering themselves
in a plethora of bureaucratic

regulations.
"Indeed, the only useful new
policy I can suggest is that all
administrative appointments on
this campus, including President,
should be reviewed every three or
four years.
"Such a policy would make the
rest of this crud unnecessary and
ridiculous."
Michael Sweeney, former
editor of The Daily and now with
The Chapparal, commented:
"As a basic principle, people
should be free to use University
facilities at any time for any
purpose. I don't understand why
there should be so many
restrictions on this freedom. My
suggestion is that the Committee
on Public Exercises hold public
hearings on the issue this fall."
Barry Askinas, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents
indicated in his comments to The
Daily that he felt the traditional
student opportunity to raise funds
in this way was valuable and
ought to be preserved. Askinas
could see an argument for some of
the profits going to the ASSU or
the University, but he believed
that the suggested policy, if
implemented would end many
student activities at Stanford and
destroy fund-raising initiative.
Pat Shea, another member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents
told The Daily last night that his
"initial reaction" to this
paragraph in the preliminary form
of the new policy was that it had
been "poorly drafted." Shea
considers the substance of the
suggested paragraph on benefits to
be out of the traditional context
in which student voluntary groups
have been able to operate. He
fears that putting into effect this

suggested change on benefits
would take away student initiative
in developing ways to fund their
own programs.
Shea, along with others who
are providing the Office of Public
Events with feedback on the
proposals contained in the draft
of the new policy, plans to send
Tom Bacchetti, the Director of
Public Events, a written
commentary on the matter. He
and Michael Sweeney also intend
to visit Bacchetti next week to
discuss with him whether public
hearings in the fall will be needed.
Paul Rupert of the Resistance

provided a political perspective on
the control of public activities at
Stanford. He sa id:*
"I suspect it's tHo University's
attempt to cut into the resources
of radical and other student
groups. As this spring showed, the
control of resources—buildings or
space, presses, other forms of
money/property—is crucial to
political control of the University.
We don't have much, but we
turned what little we had into
power. So they want to take that
away. The liberal facade will be
disappearing this year."
A tentative proposal which
would place the net revenues from
student-run benefit shows in a
*und which disburses money to all
student organizations faces
organized opposition in several
quarters.
The suggestion comes in a
paragraph on page 22 of a draft
policy manual for the Committee
of Public Exercises.
It reads: "Income in excess of
expenditures (net profit) shall be
returned to the University or the
ASSU and placed in a general
operating fund for the benefit of
all organizations sharing resources
in this fund."
The manual is being circulated
by the Office of Public Events in
order to receive revisions, advice,
and consent from various
University constituencies.
The proposal on benefits is
subject to revision, either in part
or in full. The Office of Public
Events is apparently aware of the
rising discontent and is
considering the objections being
raised. It looks as if the
Committee on Public Exercises
will be unable to complete its
review of the policy before fall
quarter.
Threatens VIA
Gunnar Erickson of the
Volunteers in Asia program told
The Daily that VIA has scheduled
a fall quarter film series, but
cannot make a commitment on
taking the films until VIA knows
what the policy will be. Erickson
added:
"The Committee on Public
Exercises is considering
eliminating student benefits. The

rationale is that facilities are
overcrowded, but instead of
establishing a reasonable system
of priorities for allotting facility
use, they propose choking out
student organizations which rely
on income from film series and
benefits.
"Whatever the motives, the
impact is political. Lights out on
Resistance and A3M film series.
The Keio and Volunteers in Asia
series appear to be civilian
casualties in a war between
bureaucrats and radicals.

Pat Shea, another member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents
told The Daily last night that his
"initial reaction" to this
paragraph in the preliminary form
of the new policy was that it had
been "poorly drafted." Shea
considers the substance of the
suggested paragraph on benefits to
be out of the traditional context
in which student voluntary groups
have been able to operate. He
fears that putting into effect this

suggested change on benefits
would take away student initiative
in developing ways to fund their
own programs.
Shea, along with others who
are providing the Office of Public
Events with feedback on the
proposals contained in the draft
of the new policy, plans to send
Tom Bacchetti, the Director of
Public Events, a written
commentary on the matter. He
and Michael Sweeney also intend
to visit Bacchetti next week to
discuss with him whether public
hearings in the fall will be needed.
Paul Rupert of the Resistance

provided a political perspective on
the control of public activities at
Stanford. He sa id:*
"I suspect it's tHo University's
attempt to cut into the resources
of radical and other student
groups. As this spring showed, the
control of resources—buildings or
space, presses, other forms of
money/property—is crucial to
political control of the University.
We don't have much, but we
turned what little we had into
power. So they want to take that
away. The liberal facade will be
disappearing this year."
A tentative proposal which
would place the net revenues from
student-run benefit shows in a
*und which disburses money to all
student organizations faces
organized opposition in several
quarters.
The suggestion comes in a
paragraph on page 22 of a draft
policy manual for the Committee
of Public Exercises.
It reads: "Income in excess of
expenditures (net profit) shall be
returned to the University or the
ASSU and placed in a general
operating fund for the benefit of
all organizations sharing resources
in this fund."
The manual is being circulated
by the Office of Public Events in
order to receive revisions, advice,
and consent from various
University constituencies.
The proposal on benefits is
subject to revision, either in part
or in full. The Office of Public
Events is apparently aware of the
rising discontent and is
considering the objections being
raised. It looks as if the
Committee on Public Exercises
will be unable to complete its
review of the policy before fall
quarter.
Threatens VIA
Gunnar Erickson of the
Volunteers in Asia program told
The Daily that VIA has scheduled
a fall quarter film series, but
cannot make a commitment on
taking the films until VIA knows
what the policy will be. Erickson
added:
"The Committee on Public
Exercises is considering
eliminating student benefits. The

rationale is that facilities are
overcrowded, but instead of
establishing a reasonable system
of priorities for allotting facility
use, they propose choking out
student organizations which rely
on income from film series and
benefits.
"Whatever the motives, the
impact is political. Lights out on
Resistance and A3M film series.
The Keio and Volunteers in Asia
series appear to be civilian
casualties in a war between
bureaucrats and radicals.
"Volunteers in Asia will
definitely have to cut back its
programs if the blackout goes into
effect."
"Anybody in this university
who seriously believes that more
policies and regulations will solve
any problems or make life at
Stanford better is a master of
self-deception.
Tim Coburn of SCORE and the
Mid peninsula Free University,
who has dealt extensively with the
Office of Public Events this
summer, offered these criticisms:
"Formalized policies are
designed primarily to protect the
status quo and according to
trustee John Gardner are a sign of
decaying institutions in a decaying
society.
"There is no indication that
the ten thousand students at
Stanford are willing to peacefully
decay by smothering themselves
in a plethora of bureaucratic

regulations.
"Indeed, the only useful new
policy I can suggest is that all
administrative appointments on
this campus, including President,
should be reviewed every three or
four years.
"Such a policy would make the
rest of this crud unnecessary and
ridiculous."
Michael Sweeney, former
editor of The Daily and now with
The Chapparal, commented:
"As a basic principle, people
should be free to use University
facilities at any time for any
purpose. I don't understand why
there should be so many
restrictions on this freedom. My
suggestion is that the Committee
on Public Exercises hold public
hearings on the issue this fall."
Barry Askinas, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents
indicated in his comments to The
Daily that he felt the traditional
student opportunity to raise funds
in this way was valuable and
ought to be preserved. Askinas
could see an argument for some of
the profits going to the ASSU or
the University, but he believed
that the suggested policy, if
implemented would end many
student activities at Stanford and
destroy fund-raising initiative.
