# Draft On Benefits Faces Opposition
## 
### BILL EVERS 
A tentative proposal which
would place the net revenues from
student-run benefit shows in a
*und which disburses money to all
student organizations faces
organized opposition in several
quarters.
The suggestion comes in a
paragraph on page 22 of a draft
policy manual for the Committee
of Public Exercises.
It reads: "Income in excess of
expenditures (net profit) shall be
returned to the University or the
ASSU and placed in a general
operating fund for the benefit of
all organizations sharing resources
in this fund."
The manual is being circulated
by the Office of Public Events in
order to receive revisions, advice,

or in full. The Office of Public
Events is apparently aware of the
rising discontent and is
considering the objections being
raised. It looks as if the
Committee on Public Exercises
will be unable to complete its
review of the policy before fall
quarter.

a fall quarter film series, but
cannot make a commitment on

rationale is that facilities are
overcrowded, but instead of

of priorities for allotting facility
use, they propose choking out
student organizations which rely
on income from film series and
benefits.
"Whatever the motives, the
impact is political. Lights out on
Resistance and A3M film series.
The Keio and Volunteers in Asia
series appear to be civilian
casualties in a war between
bureaucrats and radicals.
