# Have I Ever Lied To You?
## House For Rending 
### Art Buchwald 
WASHINGTON—A friend of
mine rented his house on the
Long Island shore for the summer
while he was traveling abroad with
his family. Then he remembered
he had forgotten to tell the man
he had rented the house to that
someone was coming to fix the oil
burner, which was in a locked
room in the cellar. So he decided
to call his house and tell the man
where the workers could find the
key. He said the conversation
went something like this:
"Hello, this is Mr. Mellon," my
friend said. "I just wanted to . .
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mellon," the
wife of the man who rented the
house said. "My husband isn't
home now."
"That's all right," Mr. Mellon
said. "How is everything?"
"Just fine, Mr. Mellon. We're
really enjoying the
house . . . Peter, will you stop
pulling on those curtains, I'm

talking on the phone. The
children love it here . . . Wanda,
what are you doing with those
scissors . . . Peter, take those
scissors away from
Wanda . . . Excuse me, Mr.
Mellon, it's raining out and the
children have to stay indoors.
What did you call about, Mr.
Mellon? . . . One minute. Peter,
put those scissors down and get
away from the drapes . . . Ethel,
you know you're not supposed to
eat ice cream in the living room.
Now, will you all be quiet? Go
ahead, Mr. Mellon."
"I called to tell you that some
men are going to come to fix the
oil heater and I wanted you to
know it was all right to let them
in"
''Why certainly, Mr.
Mellon . . . Wanda, get down off
that coffee table this instant. I
don't care what Peter did this
morning, you're not supposed to
climb on Mr. Mellon's coffee

table . . . Peter, take Wanda into
the kitchen while I'm on the
phone . . . No, don't use the
scissors, just take her by the
hand . . . I'm still here, Mr.
Mellon."
Mr. Mellon was perspiring.
"Now, what did you say, Mr.
Mellon?"
"The key for the oil burner."
"Can you hold on one minute,
Mr. Mellon? . . . Ethel, get away
from the lamp. How many do you
have to break before you learn
your lesson? . . . Peter, I told you
to take Wanda into the
kitchen . . . Tell her I'll give her a
good spanking if she plays with
Mr. Mellon's dishes. She knows
we're not allowed to use those
dishes . . . I'm sorry, Mr. Mellon,
but it's the third day it's been
raining and the children are wild."
"Where's your husband?" Mr.
Mellon asked.
"He went down to buy some
rose bushes to replace the ones in
your garden."
"What was the matter with my
rose bushes?" Mr. Mellon
demanded.
"Nothing, except the children
were playing with the dog and he
got excited and . . .Ethel, I've told
you you can't paint on Mr.
Mellon's desk. Go in the kitchen
with Peter and Wanda and find
out what that crash was . . . But
don't worry, Mr. Mellon, my
husband saved the irises and
begonias. Hello, Mr. Mellon, are
you there?-Peter-Peter!"
Mellon heard a crash and then
silence.
Mr. Mellon doesn't seem to be
enjoying Europe as much as Mrs.
Mellon thought he would, and he
hasn't the heart to tell her why* |

morning, you're not supposed to
climb on Mr. Mellon's coffee

table . . . Peter, take Wanda into
the kitchen while I'm on the
phone . . . No, don't use the
scissors, just take her by the
hand . . . I'm still here, Mr.
Mellon."
Mr. Mellon was perspiring.
"Now, what did you say, Mr.
Mellon?"
"The key for the oil burner."
"Can you hold on one minute,
Mr. Mellon? . . . Ethel, get away
from the lamp. How many do you
have to break before you learn
your lesson? . . . Peter, I told you
to take Wanda into the
kitchen . . . Tell her I'll give her a
good spanking if she plays with
Mr. Mellon's dishes. She knows
we're not allowed to use those
dishes . . . I'm sorry, Mr. Mellon,
but it's the third day it's been
raining and the children are wild."
"Where's your husband?" Mr.
Mellon asked.
"He went down to buy some
rose bushes to replace the ones in
your garden."
"What was the matter with my
rose bushes?" Mr. Mellon
demanded.
"Nothing, except the children
were playing with the dog and he
got excited and . . .Ethel, I've told
you you can't paint on Mr.
Mellon's desk. Go in the kitchen
with Peter and Wanda and find
out what that crash was . . . But
don't worry, Mr. Mellon, my
husband saved the irises and
begonias. Hello, Mr. Mellon, are
you there?-Peter-Peter!"
Mellon heard a crash and then
silence.
Mr. Mellon doesn't seem to be
enjoying Europe as much as Mrs.
Mellon thought he would, and he
hasn't the heart to tell her why* |

WASHINGTON—A friend of
mine rented his house on the
Long Island shore for the summer
while he was traveling abroad with
his family. Then he remembered
he had forgotten to tell the man
he had rented the house to that
someone was coming to fix the oil
burner, which was in a locked
room in the cellar. So he decided
to call his house and tell the man
where the workers could find the
key. He said the conversation
went something like this:
"Hello, this is Mr. Mellon," my
friend said. "I just wanted to . .
"Oh, hello, Mr. Mellon," the
wife of the man who rented the
house said. "My husband isn't
home now."
"That's all right," Mr. Mellon
said. "How is everything?"
"Just fine, Mr. Mellon. We're
really enjoying the
house . . . Peter, will you stop
pulling on those curtains, I'm

talking on the phone. The
children love it here . . . Wanda,
what are you doing with those
scissors . . . Peter, take those
scissors away from
Wanda . . . Excuse me, Mr.
Mellon, it's raining out and the
children have to stay indoors.
What did you call about, Mr.
Mellon? . . . One minute. Peter,
put those scissors down and get
away from the drapes . . . Ethel,
you know you're not supposed to
eat ice cream in the living room.
Now, will you all be quiet? Go
ahead, Mr. Mellon."
"I called to tell you that some
men are going to come to fix the
oil heater and I wanted you to
know it was all right to let them
in"
''Why certainly, Mr.
Mellon . . . Wanda, get down off
that coffee table this instant. I
don't care what Peter did this
morning, you're not supposed to
climb on Mr. Mellon's coffee

table . . . Peter, take Wanda into
