## The 						Dead Are Aliveâ€”Are We? 
### DAVE STEVENS 
Things do tend to repeat
themselves. It was ten years ago, a
nice round figure, that the rock
music world was first shattered,
first by the plane crash that took
the lives of three of our most
promising artists, Buddy Holly,
Richie Valens, and the Big
Bopper, and second, in the
business world, by the payola
scandals. I was worried by my
brother's ducktail and his
collection of switchblades.
Now I'm worried about
methedrine in our kindergartens
and the porcine tendencies of our
Supreme Court. The day before
yesterday the Wild West Show was
cancelled, the record stores are
glutted with "psychedelic music"
and last week Bill Graham
announced that he'd had it:
nobody was grateful enough to
him for making a million dollars
off the community, so he's
splitting town in December. So
long, Bill.

After Buddy Holly died,
Bobby Vee made an album with
the Crickets, Holly's old back-up
group. And again the vultures are
moving in. The Iron Butterfly are
hot in Peoria, Richard Nixon is
down on dope, and Warren Burger
is resting in the East. Things do
tend to repeat themselves.
* * *
I have no doubt about it:
within a year or so, the vitality
and inventiveness that were the
musical expression of our scene
will be a memory. It's been dying
for two years now, and that's too
long a final spasm. So like swing
jazz fans, people like me who care
enough to write this kind of
column, and people like you who
care enough to read it, will be
hoarding our records with the
belief that it will never happen
again.
And maybe it won't, but
there's no small consolation in the
record I am going to preview
today: a double-album live
recording of the Grateful Dead to
be released sometime in the Fall.
It's the Grateful Dead record, in
fact the San Francisco record that
we've all been waiting for, a
nearly flawless vinyl reproduction
of what can actually go down at
tnose concerts.
I say nearly flawless because
there's really no way that
anybody is ever going to
reproduce the feeling, the original
feeling we might have had a tew
years ago about what was
happening here, the feeling you
still find yourself carrying around
like a secret hope: nobody dances,
nobody cares. No use to belabor
the point; this is a music column
and the proper topic of discussion
is music. Except that with a group
like the Grateful Dead it's
impossible to separate the music
from those people and what they
stand for. Witness leader Jerry
Garcia, in a recent Rolling Stone
interview, on what's happened
since the "good old days":
"It was magic, far out, beautiful
magic . . .a sensitive trip, and it's been
lost . . .Like Bill Graham, he was at the
Trips Festival, and all he saw was a

light show and a band. Take the two
and you've got a formula . . .It's
watching television, large loud
television."
* * *
All right, the album: I don't
even know the name of it. I
obtained it by recording it from
KSAN last May, the only time to
my knowledge it's been played in
its entirety. The tape I have, then,
is a copy of the original master,
which means that it might go
through some changes before it
becomes an album, and which
means that it hasn't yet been
sliced up into sides and bands.
And that's groovy, and hopefully
they will keep it this way: if
you've ever seen the Dead on a
good night, you know they don't
come on and say "now we're
going to play 'Satisfaction,' blah
blah, then we'll do this thing we
learned from Albert King, blah
blah, then we'll do this far-our
jam on 'Louie, Louie!"
In some pure sense, they just
come on stage and play music.
That's what this tape is: an
hour and a half or uninterrupted
rolling together music. It begins at
a low pressure, with some
excellent interplay between
bassist Phil Lesh and rhythm
guitarist Bob Weir and ends with a
mind-blowing ten minutes of
amplifier electronics. Garcia's
guitar has never been so beautiful
in its lyric, jazzy lines, and
(surprise) even the singing is good.
Of the numbers I can separate and
can give names to, they do "St.
Stephen", a happy, bouncing
number from their latest studio
album Aoxotnoxoa, a jam
following that which sounds like
R,ichie Valens' "La Bamba",
Bobby "Blue'' Bland's
"Lovelight", where wonderful old
Pig Pen struts his stuff, and a
breath-taking "Death Has No
Mercy", featuring melodic
feedback work by Garcia.
What can I say? What can be
said about the Grateful Dead's
music without talking about a
whole lot of things that are not
supposed to be the proper
concern of a rock music column?

Buy the album when it comes out;
it's beautiful, and they need the
bread.
Two things I leave you with (a
note of optimism): one, there's a
dance this Sunday at Frost
featuring the Sons of Champlin
and the best unrecorded band in
the area, Country Weather, a
benefit for some people that need
your support and your money. Go
to it. Second, next time you're

buying an Iron Butterfly album
and wondering when Bobby
Vinton will be nominated to the
Burger Court, remember that the
Grateful Dead have something
better for you just around the
corner: "We're tired of jerking
off," Garcia said in that same
interview, "and we want to start
fucking again." Goodbye, Bill
Graham, goodbye, summer
school. I won't miss either of you.

It's the Grateful Dead record, in
fact the San Francisco record that
we've all been waiting for, a
nearly flawless vinyl reproduction
of what can actually go down at
tnose concerts.
I say nearly flawless because
there's really no way that
anybody is ever going to
reproduce the feeling, the original
feeling we might have had a tew
years ago about what was
happening here, the feeling you
still find yourself carrying around
like a secret hope: nobody dances,
nobody cares. No use to belabor
the point; this is a music column
and the proper topic of discussion
is music. Except that with a group
like the Grateful Dead it's
impossible to separate the music
from those people and what they
stand for. Witness leader Jerry
Garcia, in a recent Rolling Stone
interview, on what's happened
since the "good old days":
"It was magic, far out, beautiful
magic . . .a sensitive trip, and it's been
lost . . .Like Bill Graham, he was at the
Trips Festival, and all he saw was a

light show and a band. Take the two
and you've got a formula . . .It's
watching television, large loud
television."

All right, the album: I don't
even know the name of it. I
obtained it by recording it from
KSAN last May, the only time to
my knowledge it's been played in
its entirety. The tape I have, then,
is a copy of the original master,
which means that it might go
through some changes before it
becomes an album, and which
means that it hasn't yet been
sliced up into sides and bands.
And that's groovy, and hopefully
they will keep it this way: if
you've ever seen the Dead on a
good night, you know they don't
come on and say "now we're
going to play 'Satisfaction,' blah
blah, then we'll do this thing we
learned from Albert King, blah
blah, then we'll do this far-our
jam on 'Louie, Louie!"
In some pure sense, they just
come on stage and play music.
That's what this tape is: an
hour and a half or uninterrupted
rolling together music. It begins at
a low pressure, with some
excellent interplay between
bassist Phil Lesh and rhythm
guitarist Bob Weir and ends with a
mind-blowing ten minutes of
amplifier electronics. Garcia's
guitar has never been so beautiful
in its lyric, jazzy lines, and
(surprise) even the singing is good.
Of the numbers I can separate and
can give names to, they do "St.
Stephen", a happy, bouncing
number from their latest studio
album Aoxotnoxoa, a jam
following that which sounds like
R,ichie Valens' "La Bamba",
Bobby "Blue'' Bland's
"Lovelight", where wonderful old
Pig Pen struts his stuff, and a
breath-taking "Death Has No
Mercy", featuring melodic
feedback work by Garcia.
What can I say? What can be
said about the Grateful Dead's
music without talking about a
whole lot of things that are not
supposed to be the proper
concern of a rock music column?

Buy the album when it comes out;
it's beautiful, and they need the
bread.
Two things I leave you with (a
note of optimism): one, there's a
dance this Sunday at Frost
featuring the Sons of Champlin
and the best unrecorded band in
the area, Country Weather, a
benefit for some people that need
your support and your money. Go
to it. Second, next time you're

buying an Iron Butterfly album
and wondering when Bobby
Vinton will be nominated to the
Burger Court, remember that the
Grateful Dead have something
better for you just around the
corner: "We're tired of jerking
off," Garcia said in that same
interview, "and we want to start
fucking again." Goodbye, Bill
Graham, goodbye, summer
school. I won't miss either of you.
Things do tend to repeat
themselves. It was ten years ago, a
nice round figure, that the rock
music world was first shattered,
first by the plane crash that took
the lives of three of our most
promising artists, Buddy Holly,
Richie Valens, and the Big
Bopper, and second, in the
business world, by the payola
scandals. I was worried by my
brother's ducktail and his
collection of switchblades.
Now I'm worried about
methedrine in our kindergartens
and the porcine tendencies of our
Supreme Court. The day before
yesterday the Wild West Show was
cancelled, the record stores are
glutted with "psychedelic music"
and last week Bill Graham
announced that he'd had it:
nobody was grateful enough to
him for making a million dollars
off the community, so he's
splitting town in December. So
long, Bill.

After Buddy Holly died,
Bobby Vee made an album with
the Crickets, Holly's old back-up
group. And again the vultures are
moving in. The Iron Butterfly are
hot in Peoria, Richard Nixon is
down on dope, and Warren Burger
is resting in the East. Things do
tend to repeat themselves.
* * *
I have no doubt about it:
within a year or so, the vitality
and inventiveness that were the
musical expression of our scene
will be a memory. It's been dying
for two years now, and that's too
long a final spasm. So like swing
jazz fans, people like me who care
enough to write this kind of
column, and people like you who
care enough to read it, will be
hoarding our records with the
belief that it will never happen
again.
And maybe it won't, but
there's no small consolation in the
record I am going to preview
today: a double-album live
recording of the Grateful Dead to
be released sometime in the Fall.

learned from Albert King, blah
blah, then we'll do this far-our
jam on 'Louie, Louie!"
In some pure sense, they just
come on stage and play music.
That's what this tape is: an
hour and a half or uninterrupted
rolling together music. It begins at
a low pressure, with some
excellent interplay between
bassist Phil Lesh and rhythm
guitarist Bob Weir and ends with a
mind-blowing ten minutes of
amplifier electronics. Garcia's
guitar has never been so beautiful
in its lyric, jazzy lines, and
(surprise) even the singing is good.
Of the numbers I can separate and
can give names to, they do "St.
Stephen", a happy, bouncing
number from their latest studio
album Aoxotnoxoa, a jam
following that which sounds like
R,ichie Valens' "La Bamba",
Bobby "Blue'' Bland's
"Lovelight", where wonderful old
Pig Pen struts his stuff, and a
breath-taking "Death Has No
Mercy", featuring melodic
feedback work by Garcia.
What can I say? What can be
said about the Grateful Dead's
music without talking about a
whole lot of things that are not
supposed to be the proper
concern of a rock music column?

Buy the album when it comes out;
it's beautiful, and they need the
bread.
Two things I leave you with (a
note of optimism): one, there's a
dance this Sunday at Frost
featuring the Sons of Champlin
and the best unrecorded band in
the area, Country Weather, a
benefit for some people that need
your support and your money. Go
to it. Second, next time you're

buying an Iron Butterfly album
and wondering when Bobby
Vinton will be nominated to the
Burger Court, remember that the
Grateful Dead have something
better for you just around the
corner: "We're tired of jerking
off," Garcia said in that same
interview, "and we want to start
fucking again." Goodbye, Bill
Graham, goodbye, summer
school. I won't miss either of you.
Things do tend to repeat
themselves. It was ten years ago, a
nice round figure, that the rock
music world was first shattered,
first by the plane crash that took
the lives of three of our most
promising artists, Buddy Holly,
Richie Valens, and the Big
Bopper, and second, in the
business world, by the payola
scandals. I was worried by my
brother's ducktail and his
collection of switchblades.
Now I'm worried about
methedrine in our kindergartens
and the porcine tendencies of our
Supreme Court. The day before
yesterday the Wild West Show was
cancelled, the record stores are
glutted with "psychedelic music"
and last week Bill Graham
announced that he'd had it:
nobody was grateful enough to
him for making a million dollars
off the community, so he's
splitting town in December. So
long, Bill.

After Buddy Holly died,
Bobby Vee made an album with
the Crickets, Holly's old back-up
group. And again the vultures are
moving in. The Iron Butterfly are
hot in Peoria, Richard Nixon is
down on dope, and Warren Burger
is resting in the East. Things do
tend to repeat themselves.
* * *
I have no doubt about it:
within a year or so, the vitality
and inventiveness that were the
musical expression of our scene
will be a memory. It's been dying
for two years now, and that's too
long a final spasm. So like swing
jazz fans, people like me who care
enough to write this kind of
column, and people like you who
care enough to read it, will be
hoarding our records with the
belief that it will never happen
again.
And maybe it won't, but
there's no small consolation in the
record I am going to preview
today: a double-album live
recording of the Grateful Dead to
be released sometime in the Fall.
It's the Grateful Dead record, in
fact the San Francisco record that
we've all been waiting for, a
nearly flawless vinyl reproduction
of what can actually go down at
tnose concerts.
I say nearly flawless because
there's really no way that
anybody is ever going to
reproduce the feeling, the original
feeling we might have had a tew
years ago about what was
happening here, the feeling you
still find yourself carrying around
like a secret hope: nobody dances,
nobody cares. No use to belabor
the point; this is a music column
and the proper topic of discussion
is music. Except that with a group
like the Grateful Dead it's
impossible to separate the music
from those people and what they
stand for. Witness leader Jerry
Garcia, in a recent Rolling Stone
interview, on what's happened
since the "good old days":
"It was magic, far out, beautiful
magic . . .a sensitive trip, and it's been
lost . . .Like Bill Graham, he was at the
Trips Festival, and all he saw was a

light show and a band. Take the two
and you've got a formula . . .It's
watching television, large loud
television."
* * *
All right, the album: I don't
even know the name of it. I
obtained it by recording it from
KSAN last May, the only time to
my knowledge it's been played in
its entirety. The tape I have, then,
is a copy of the original master,
which means that it might go
through some changes before it
becomes an album, and which
means that it hasn't yet been
sliced up into sides and bands.
And that's groovy, and hopefully
they will keep it this way: if
you've ever seen the Dead on a
good night, you know they don't
come on and say "now we're
going to play 'Satisfaction,' blah
blah, then we'll do this thing we
learned from Albert King, blah
blah, then we'll do this far-our
jam on 'Louie, Louie!"
