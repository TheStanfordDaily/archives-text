## Profits In Privacy 
### Joshua Lederberg 
The collection of data for statistical purposes is a threat to
individual privacy which has figured in many recent books and
articles. It is mostly a hypothetical threat, supported by few if any
examples of real abuse. However, there is some foundation for the
concern that malicious people will exploit the convenience and low
cost of sieving large amounts of data with a computer, and w«
should be thinking about the kind of laws we need to prevent such
abuse.
Meanwhile, two kinds of organizations make a business of
analyzing personal information. In the public domain, we have the
law enforcement agencies, investigative committees of Congress and
welfare administrations. Here we must balance community versus
individual values: for example, how far should we delve into citizens'
private affairs to be sure that no one cheats on welfare payments, or
to discover whether someone might be a security risk because
someone else might blackmail him?
It is easy for the privileged to set up very strict rules—for the
others. I must appeal to those who are crying the loudest alarms
about the violation of privacy "by computers" to be equally
concerned about wiretapping, preventive detention, indictment by
publicity and humiliating "need tests" for public benefits. In this
sphere, computers are merely the instruments of policy that is, for
the most part, set by affirmative law.
In our relationship with the government, we can secure any
degree of privacy to the extent that we value this over the seeming
efficiency of government. Law enforcement could become the
overriding goal to the exclusion of other values. We then pay for it
by many intrusions on and occasional injustices to the innocent.
This, after all, is what we mean by the "police state."
Private business is also deeply involved in marketing personal
information on a large scale, a trade that used to be the province of
the private detective. Credit bureaus maintain files on over 100
million citizens and, with a few commendable exceptions, are quite
lax about the quality of their data or the purposes to which their
customers put it.
This comment is not to depreciate the ethical motivation of the
credit bureaucrat. It is just an economic fact that reliable data would
be expensive to maintain, as would be any effective surveillance of
their end uses. Merchants are also pressed to accept cheap
evaluations of credit risks, which must be biased to blackball every
deadbeat, even if many conscientious, bill-paying consumers are also
hurt by human or mechanical errors.
Such an industry has to be regulated or it will be dominated by
its most irresponsible and insensitive members. Computer
technology aggravates the situation by making it inexpensive to keep
and transfer large files of wooden data. If humanly oriented
standards are established, the same technology can help assure that
spurious or unfair records kept by different organizations are all
correctly updated without requiring an impossible effort by the
consumer.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act, being pushed in the House by
Rep. C.E. Gallegher (D-N.J.) and in the Senate by Sen. William
Proxmire (D-Wis.) is an important, but limited, step towards
effective regulation. It has also been endorsed by Virginia Knauer,
the President's adviser on consumer affairs.
Its most important provision would give the Federal Reserve
Board some general regulatory authority over the bureaus to ensure
the accuracy and confidentiality of their files. Individual customers
would have to be notified of certain adverse reports and would have
the right to submit corrections.
As Mrs. Knauer pointed out, the bill as written would not require
notification except for "matter of public record" and would allow
secret slanders to smolder in the files. The bill is nevertheless an
important first step. It should be enacted as a foundation for
extending its principles, for example, as Rep. Edward Koch (D-N.Y.)
has attempted in his Federal Privacy Act for data held by
governmental agencies.
We should also think about requiring the bonding of key
employees in the bureaus and promulgating a general ethical code
for data-handling personnel who are entrusted with the dignity and
reputation of so many citizens.

efficiency of government. Law enforcement could become the
overriding goal to the exclusion of other values. We then pay for it
by many intrusions on and occasional injustices to the innocent.
This, after all, is what we mean by the "police state."
Private business is also deeply involved in marketing personal
information on a large scale, a trade that used to be the province of
the private detective. Credit bureaus maintain files on over 100
million citizens and, with a few commendable exceptions, are quite
lax about the quality of their data or the purposes to which their
customers put it.
This comment is not to depreciate the ethical motivation of the
credit bureaucrat. It is just an economic fact that reliable data would
be expensive to maintain, as would be any effective surveillance of
their end uses. Merchants are also pressed to accept cheap
evaluations of credit risks, which must be biased to blackball every
deadbeat, even if many conscientious, bill-paying consumers are also
hurt by human or mechanical errors.
Such an industry has to be regulated or it will be dominated by
its most irresponsible and insensitive members. Computer
technology aggravates the situation by making it inexpensive to keep
and transfer large files of wooden data. If humanly oriented
standards are established, the same technology can help assure that
spurious or unfair records kept by different organizations are all
correctly updated without requiring an impossible effort by the
consumer.
The Fair Credit Reporting Act, being pushed in the House by
Rep. C.E. Gallegher (D-N.J.) and in the Senate by Sen. William
Proxmire (D-Wis.) is an important, but limited, step towards
effective regulation. It has also been endorsed by Virginia Knauer,
the President's adviser on consumer affairs.
Its most important provision would give the Federal Reserve
Board some general regulatory authority over the bureaus to ensure
the accuracy and confidentiality of their files. Individual customers
would have to be notified of certain adverse reports and would have
the right to submit corrections.
As Mrs. Knauer pointed out, the bill as written would not require
notification except for "matter of public record" and would allow
secret slanders to smolder in the files. The bill is nevertheless an
important first step. It should be enacted as a foundation for
extending its principles, for example, as Rep. Edward Koch (D-N.Y.)
has attempted in his Federal Privacy Act for data held by
governmental agencies.
We should also think about requiring the bonding of key
employees in the bureaus and promulgating a general ethical code
for data-handling personnel who are entrusted with the dignity and
reputation of so many citizens.

The collection of data for statistical purposes is a threat to
individual privacy which has figured in many recent books and
articles. It is mostly a hypothetical threat, supported by few if any
examples of real abuse. However, there is some foundation for the
concern that malicious people will exploit the convenience and low
cost of sieving large amounts of data with a computer, and w«
should be thinking about the kind of laws we need to prevent such
abuse.
Meanwhile, two kinds of organizations make a business of
analyzing personal information. In the public domain, we have the
law enforcement agencies, investigative committees of Congress and
welfare administrations. Here we must balance community versus
individual values: for example, how far should we delve into citizens'
private affairs to be sure that no one cheats on welfare payments, or
to discover whether someone might be a security risk because
someone else might blackmail him?
It is easy for the privileged to set up very strict rules—for the
others. I must appeal to those who are crying the loudest alarms
about the violation of privacy "by computers" to be equally
concerned about wiretapping, preventive detention, indictment by
publicity and humiliating "need tests" for public benefits. In this
sphere, computers are merely the instruments of policy that is, for
the most part, set by affirmative law.
In our relationship with the government, we can secure any
degree of privacy to the extent that we value this over the seeming
efficiency of government. Law enforcement could become the
overriding goal to the exclusion of other values. We then pay for it
by many intrusions on and occasional injustices to the innocent.
