# Sounds Like Summer
## Jazz Fantastic 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
As I noted in our last issue, the
Concord Summer Festival, a
newcomer to the Bay Area jazz
calendar, has slated some great
jazz groups. Their marquee glitters
with the names of Shelly Manne,
Buddy Rich, Bola Sete, Cal
Tjader, Stan Kenton, Lalo
Schifrin, Don Ellis, and Vince
Guaraldi, among others. But the
long-established Monterey Jazz
Festival answers the challenge of
the younger Festival with stars of
its own, and while Monterey will
have fewer shows (five to
Concord's seven), they will have
more groups overall, 25 to the 21
playing at Concord. And everyone
at Monterey plays jazz.
Monterey opens with the
Modern Jazz Quartet and Sly and
the Family Stone, along with the
Peanuts Hucko-Red No rv o
Quintet and the Tony Williams
Trio, on Friday night at 9 PM,
September 19. The MJQ —piano,
vibes, bass, and drums—has been
playing off and on at the Festival
since 1958, and has built up
something of a reputation for
imaginative styling and intriguing
arrangements both in this country
and abroad. They are a tasteful
and talented group, and should
provide quite a contrast to Sly
and the Family Stone.
The next concert is Saturday
afternoon at 1:30, and stars the
Buddy Guy Blues Band and the
all-time jazz great, Willie "the
Lion" Smith, with Roberta Flack
and her Trio and Little Esther
Phillips. Buddy Guy is among the
best blues men around, with
blazing guitar technique,
gospel-inspired vocals, and an
impassioned energy that infuses
all his work. Again, an interesting
contrast is the legendary jazz
pianist, Lion Smith. He has been
playing professionally since 1914;
he has been through dozens of
jazz fads and movements,
changing a little with the times,
but always retaining his ebullent
style, his big cigar, and his bowler
hat.
The Miles Davis Quintet and
the Thelonious Monk Quartet

highlight Saturday evening's
performance, along with Bobby
Bryant and Joe Williams. Davis
and Monk are two of the most
popular jazz artist, and have also
served the cause of continuing
jazz by bringing younger men into
the jazz scene. They both play
solid driving jazz, very good
listening.
Sunday afternoon's concert, at
1:30 PM, could be interesting, and
could fall flat. Monterey has
jumped onto the eclectic
bandwagon, by signing the MJQ
to play with the Los Angeles
String Quartet, and then to be
joined by Cannonball Adderly.
Also playing will be the Fourth
Way, a new jazz-oriented quartet
with violin, piano, bass and
drums. It might be good, but since
two of the works are world
premieres, one by John Lewis and
the other by Bill Fischer, I really
can't be sure.
The final show is Sunday,
September 21, at 7:15 PM, and it
will really swing with the Buddy
Rich Band, Cannonball Adderly
Quintet, Sarah Vaugn, George
Duke Trio and Bobby Bryant with
the Monterey Jazz Festival

All-Stars. Cannonball Adderly,
who acquired his nickname
because of his prodigious appetite
(he used to be known as
"Cannibal"), plays alto and leads
the great group consisting of
brother Nat on cornet, Joe
Zawinul on piano, Victor Gaskin
on bass and Roy McCurdy on
drums. Cannonball played with
Miles Davis until 1959, and you
will recognize the similarities in
their styles. I find Adderly's group
more daring and more creative,
however—and their ideas and
innovations usually work. One
example is their recording of
Nippon Soul, made on a Far East
tour, in which they translate into
music how they felt about Japan.
So there you have it. Two
excellent jazz festivals in the Bay
Area in the next two months—at
Concord from August 26 through
the 31 (Concord Summer Festival,
P.O. Box 845, Concord, 94520),
and at the Monterey Fairgrounds
from September 19 through the
21 (Monterey Jazz Festival, PO
Box JAZZ, ftionterey, 93940).
With such incredible collections of
talent, tickets will be going fast,
so write now.

and abroad. They are a tasteful
and talented group, and should
provide quite a contrast to Sly
and the Family Stone.
The next concert is Saturday
afternoon at 1:30, and stars the
Buddy Guy Blues Band and the
all-time jazz great, Willie "the
Lion" Smith, with Roberta Flack
and her Trio and Little Esther
Phillips. Buddy Guy is among the
best blues men around, with
blazing guitar technique,
gospel-inspired vocals, and an
impassioned energy that infuses
all his work. Again, an interesting
contrast is the legendary jazz
pianist, Lion Smith. He has been
playing professionally since 1914;
he has been through dozens of
jazz fads and movements,
changing a little with the times,
but always retaining his ebullent
style, his big cigar, and his bowler
hat.
The Miles Davis Quintet and
the Thelonious Monk Quartet

highlight Saturday evening's
performance, along with Bobby
Bryant and Joe Williams. Davis
and Monk are two of the most
popular jazz artist, and have also
served the cause of continuing
jazz by bringing younger men into
the jazz scene. They both play
solid driving jazz, very good
listening.
Sunday afternoon's concert, at
1:30 PM, could be interesting, and
could fall flat. Monterey has
jumped onto the eclectic
bandwagon, by signing the MJQ
to play with the Los Angeles
String Quartet, and then to be
joined by Cannonball Adderly.
Also playing will be the Fourth
Way, a new jazz-oriented quartet
with violin, piano, bass and
drums. It might be good, but since
two of the works are world
premieres, one by John Lewis and
the other by Bill Fischer, I really
can't be sure.
The final show is Sunday,
September 21, at 7:15 PM, and it
will really swing with the Buddy
Rich Band, Cannonball Adderly
Quintet, Sarah Vaugn, George
Duke Trio and Bobby Bryant with
the Monterey Jazz Festival

All-Stars. Cannonball Adderly,
who acquired his nickname
because of his prodigious appetite
(he used to be known as
"Cannibal"), plays alto and leads
the great group consisting of
brother Nat on cornet, Joe
Zawinul on piano, Victor Gaskin
on bass and Roy McCurdy on
drums. Cannonball played with
Miles Davis until 1959, and you
will recognize the similarities in
their styles. I find Adderly's group
more daring and more creative,
however—and their ideas and
innovations usually work. One
example is their recording of
Nippon Soul, made on a Far East
tour, in which they translate into
music how they felt about Japan.
So there you have it. Two
excellent jazz festivals in the Bay
Area in the next two months—at
Concord from August 26 through
the 31 (Concord Summer Festival,
P.O. Box 845, Concord, 94520),
and at the Monterey Fairgrounds
from September 19 through the
21 (Monterey Jazz Festival, PO
Box JAZZ, ftionterey, 93940).
With such incredible collections of
talent, tickets will be going fast,
so write now.
As I noted in our last issue, the
Concord Summer Festival, a
newcomer to the Bay Area jazz
calendar, has slated some great
jazz groups. Their marquee glitters
with the names of Shelly Manne,
Buddy Rich, Bola Sete, Cal
Tjader, Stan Kenton, Lalo
Schifrin, Don Ellis, and Vince
Guaraldi, among others. But the
long-established Monterey Jazz
Festival answers the challenge of
the younger Festival with stars of
its own, and while Monterey will
have fewer shows (five to
Concord's seven), they will have
more groups overall, 25 to the 21
playing at Concord. And everyone
at Monterey plays jazz.
Monterey opens with the
Modern Jazz Quartet and Sly and
the Family Stone, along with the
Peanuts Hucko-Red No rv o
Quintet and the Tony Williams
Trio, on Friday night at 9 PM,
September 19. The MJQ —piano,
vibes, bass, and drums—has been
playing off and on at the Festival
since 1958, and has built up
something of a reputation for
imaginative styling and intriguing
arrangements both in this country
and abroad. They are a tasteful
and talented group, and should
provide quite a contrast to Sly
and the Family Stone.
