## The 						Joffrey Ballet 
### LARRY FRIEDLANDER 
My voice can add little to the
laudamus tc which has choired
about the Joffrey company on its
recent tours. It is worth seeing.
See it if you still can.
But after praise comes
appraisal and the ever cautionary
note of the critic. For Joffery is
an ambitious man; in his desire to
unite the multiple styles of
contemporary dance within a
single company, he faces
extraordinarily difficult problems.
Classical and modern dance
techniques do not blend easily.
They are products of diverse ages,
and diverse needs. They offer
profoundly differing visions of
man's relationship to his body and
the space it inhabits.
True to its aristocratic lineage,
classical ballet is severely
hierarchical and rational. That is,
it picks and chooses from the
endless possibilities of physical
gesture only those which seem
essential, permanent and ordered.
To these movements it assigns the
quality of beauty.
Primarily beauty is linked to
those moments when the conflict
between a powerful impulse to
transcend the laws of gravity and
the confines of space and the
absolute demands of controlled
form and decorum reaches highest
tension. The technique is
mathematical, the destination,
infinity. The dancer hovering in
the air one split second longer
than mortals should, the ballerina
extending her limbs in the
limitless line of an arabesque,
both make manifest for us an
ideal mastery and control
ordinarily denied man.
Tension and joy. The f aint
quiver of the outstretched toot,
the nervous calm of the dancer's
neck and arms, the perfectly
geometric forms sculpted by the
body, by the arms, by the
carefully phrased enchainemcnts.
In the modern dance, man is
no longer the shaper of his own
space; he does not create it, carry
it with him, lovingly define it;
rather, he moves through the
emptiness of the stage as through
a great resistance, pushing and
probing; he retreats deep within
his own body, down into the
pelvis and the stomach. As much
object as master, his density and
power are counterbalanced by
the surrounding impassivities.
Bodies are not resonant and
meta-physical, at least not
automatically. They struggle to
break loose, to extend, to impress
the emptiness about them; as
often as not they fail. The body

contracts; hands let go, torsoes
slither and turn; a brooding
impassivity inhabits the once
aspiring and confident dancer.
With the fundamental
relationship so profoundly
reversed, hierarchies of movement
lose their point. Every ache,
shudder, and spasm of the body is
true because there. Presented with
the fact of these bodies in this
space we watch every contrivance
of the dancer with equal interest.
We watch as he even relinquishes
movement to the space,
experiencing with him its
emptiness and its silence.
The peculiar flat footed
assertive walk of the modern
dancer, his sudden transitions
from immobility to convulsive or
lyrical movement form the basic
pattern. The comedy of the clown
and the madman is always close at
hand.
Robbm's 'Moves' is a glorious
ballet, performed without music
or costumes. Dancers meet, touch,
move, drift apart, regroup, in
constant tentativeness probing of
themselves and others. Freeing
itself from music, the ballet is in
the highest sense musical; the
rhythms of contact and release are
elaborated by the shuffling,
stamping, and stylized breathing
of the dancers. Silence and space
are magically alive, but not
human. When the dancers end, we
feel the stage itself should take a
bow.
"Astarte" on the other hand,
in spite of its rash of modish and
fashionable effects: movies,
strobes, undressings, and a dancer
who disappears through the
backstage door into the street, is
basically traditional in its
conception. After the dancer has
undressed he still looks quite
clothed, in the clarity of his own
body and gestures. I'm not
putting it down; it works as
theater, but as a poorly temporary
solution to the problem created
by the clash of styles and intent.
Here the ironic juxtaposition of a
formal pas de deux and the
frenzied montage of the screen
creates a unity. But in "Clowns,"
by Arpino, the choreographer has
not found a style appropriate to
the subject. The agony of the
characters represented through
conventional mine, in sound and
fury, is not made manifest in a
fresh vision of the body moving in
space. Arpino's effects are
masterful; he knows spectacle and
is a master of illusionistic effects.
But these accomplishments are
negated to the emptiness of the
dance invention.

The company's eclecticism is
not only refreshing; it is
necessary. However, there must be
a stronger, tougher attempt to
face up to the problems posed by
this avid ingathering of techniques
and style, questions which have to
be worked out both in the
classroom and in the
choreographer's mind.
