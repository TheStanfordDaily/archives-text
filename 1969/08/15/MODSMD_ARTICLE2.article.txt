# Students Plan Workshops

### 
By TIM COBURN
Starting this fall students will
be offered a chance to study, for
academic credit, some of the
"stark and immediate problems"
facing our society. The problem
areas range from Arms Control
and Disarmament Negotiations to
Privacy in the Computer Age to
The Causes of Migration of Low
Income Families From the Palo
Alto Area. The total number of
workshops scheduled is presently
ten with two or three additional
offerings being considered. They
will be open to all students.
The impetus for courses on
current social and political issues
arose this last spring. According to
Bob Jaffe, one of the graduate
students organizing the
workshops, "the haivete of many
members of the Stanford
community on social and political
questions became apparent during
the April 3rd Movement and

consequent sit-in. Sophisticated
scientists, forced to make
decisions for the community at
large, appeared helpless and
uninformed. They seemed to
resent the demands made on their
valuable time, implying, in effect,
that they don't make policy
decisions, they only work here."
The underlying assumption of
the proposed workshops is that all
of the members of the Stanford
community do more than "just
work here." Indeed, the
organizers feel that the university
has a major responsibility for
learning and supplying both the
facts on social and political
problems as well as thoughtfully
directed channels of action which
reflect the appropriate "sense of
urgency." The workshops will also
differ from the standard
university course offerings by
their multidisciplinary approach
to a specific problem. In the past,

the multidisciplinary ' view has
only been available to some
graduate students and has only
been encouraged by a few faculty
members and departments.
The structures of the
workshops vary considerably.
Some will have faculty sponsors,
some will be conducted largely by
graduate students and staff.
Moreover, according to the
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops On
Political and Social Issues)
organizing committee, "the
format of the workshops will
evolve as the work proceeds.
Initially, most groups will
probably meet weekly, or twice a
week as seminars. Later, field
trips, interviews, and community
action projects should be
anticipated ... It is expected that

One of the more imaginative
possibilities in the workshops is
suggested for the Arms Control
and Disarmament group. "It is
expected that this workshop may
want to arrange a conference
between Russian and American
students who have studied
disarmament questions." No
doubt, such a conference would
have to be held in Geneva if
present state department
paranoias are any indication.
Another problem for the
workshops lies in the area of
funding and control. If this fall's
efforts prove successful and
popular some funding may
become available from general
university funds.

Starting this fall students will
be offered a chance to study, for
academic credit, some of the
"stark and immediate problems"
facing our society. The problem
areas range from Arms Control
and Disarmament Negotiations to
Privacy in the Computer Age to
The Causes of Migration of Low
Income Families From the Palo
Alto Area. The total number of
workshops scheduled is presently
ten with two or three additional
offerings being considered. They
will be open to all students.
The impetus for courses on
current social and political issues
arose this last spring. According to
Bob Jaffe, one of the graduate
students organizing the
workshops, "the haivete of many
members of the Stanford
community on social and political
questions became apparent during
the April 3rd Movement and

consequent sit-in. Sophisticated
scientists, forced to make
decisions for the community at
large, appeared helpless and
uninformed. They seemed to
resent the demands made on their
valuable time, implying, in effect,
that they don't make policy
decisions, they only work here."
The underlying assumption of
the proposed workshops is that all
of the members of the Stanford
community do more than "just
work here." Indeed, the
organizers feel that the university
has a major responsibility for
learning and supplying both the
facts on social and political
problems as well as thoughtfully
directed channels of action which
reflect the appropriate "sense of
urgency." The workshops will also
differ from the standard
university course offerings by
their multidisciplinary approach
to a specific problem. In the past,

the multidisciplinary ' view has
only been available to some
graduate students and has only
been encouraged by a few faculty
members and departments.
The structures of the
workshops vary considerably.
Some will have faculty sponsors,
some will be conducted largely by
graduate students and staff.
Moreover, according to the
SWOPSI (Stanford Workshops On
Political and Social Issues)
organizing committee, "the
format of the workshops will
evolve as the work proceeds.
Initially, most groups will
probably meet weekly, or twice a
week as seminars. Later, field
trips, interviews, and community
action projects should be
anticipated ... It is expected that
some of the workshops would
extend over two or more quarters
in order to allow for full study of
the problem and substantial work
of solutions."
One of the more imaginative
possibilities in the workshops is
suggested for the Arms Control
and Disarmament group. "It is
expected that this workshop may
want to arrange a conference
between Russian and American
students who have studied
disarmament questions." No
doubt, such a conference would
have to be held in Geneva if
present state department
paranoias are any indication.
Another problem for the
workshops lies in the area of
funding and control. If this fall's
efforts prove successful and
popular some funding may
become available from general
university funds.

The SWOPSI organizing
committee is anxious to have any
student, faculty, or staff member
interested in helping with the
workshop program contact them
through Bob Jaffe in Physics, or
Joyce Kobayashi at ASSU. Full
descriptions of courses and sign
up lists will be available at fall
registration.
