# SRI Trials Start Monday

### YALE BRAUNSTEIN 
Copyright The Stanford Daily
The first of several trials arising
out of the arrests of April Third
Movement (A3M) members for
the demonstration and work
stoppage at the Stanford Research
Institute Hanover facility May 16
starts Monday. Jeanne Friedman,
Myron Filene, and Scott Johnson
are each charged with inciting to
riot, unlawful assembly,
obstructing a public area, trespass,
and disturbing the peace.
They will be defending
themselves in a jury trial. They
have stated that it is their intent
to make the trial a political rather
than a legal event.
Subpoenas Served
In an organized move last

evening subpoenas requested by
the defendants were served on
SRI officials. The subpoenas
require presence in court so that
testimony on the demonstration
and the events leading up to it
may be taken.
Those served are SRI President
Charles Anderson; Homer Meaders
Jr., public relations director;
Weldon Gibson, executive
vice-president and director of SRI
International; Lloyd Schuknecht
and Milton Nurom of SRI
security; Vice-President for
Economics Kenneth Beggs; and
Gordon Parker, executive assistant
to the president.
An additional subpoena was
served on Ernest Arbuckle, trustee
of both Stanford and SRI and

former dean of the Graduate
School of Business.
Court Motions
Other legal activity has
centered on a defendant-filed
discovery motion seeking police
radio tapes in addition to other
prosecution evidence. A discovery
motion, once approved by the
court, must be complied with in
five days. That time period has
elapsed, and the tapes have still
not been released.
After being questioned by the
defendants, the District Attorney
suggested they file a "show cause"
order against the police. This step
is still under consideration.
A similar motion had been
filed by attorneys for the other 85
defendants. They will seek a court
order today demanding the tapes.
Named in this action will be Palo
Alto Mayor Arnold, City Manager
Morgan, Chief of Police Hydie,
Detective Goodyear, and the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney.
Several A3M members
speculated that the tapes will
show a conscious effort by the
police to arrest radicals while
leaving members of the Young
Americans for Freedom and the
Coalition for an Academic
Community untouched. The YAF
and CAC members were present in
an effort to help obtain evidence
for the police by observing and
taking photographs of the events
which occurred.
Further Trials
Monday's trial will be followed
by others in September. The
charges range from trespass to
assualt and from failure to
disperse to motor vehicle code
violations.
Most of the trials will be for
groups of defendants. The

Monday's trial will be followed
by others in September. The
charges range from trespass to
assualt and from failure to
disperse to motor vehicle code
violations.
Most of the trials will be for
groups of defendants. The
groupings are based on the
similarities in the charges and in
the time of occurrence.
Members of the A3M have
stated the opinion that they are
being tied up in court in an effort
to prevent further political
activity by radical students. They
also point out that over $30,000
is being tied up in bail—money
that they could use for leaflets
and other expenses.
Student Opinion
When asked to comment on
the use of the courts by the A3M,
one Stanford student expressed
these views:
"Although this gives the
trustees and others a taste of their
own medicine, leftists serving
subpoenas are co-operating with
the police state. This is a clear
case of subpoenas envy. The Palo
Alto pigs and Friedenthal's
judicial council use subpoenas;
now the trial defendants are
crypto-piglets with their own
subpoenas, very like Harvey
Hukari and his blue-buttoned
hayakawas."
In reply one A3M member said
that she felt that this use of
subpoenas and court motions
came out of the common law
tradition which people have used
throughout history. She went on
to distinguish between laws
written to support the ruling class
and laws that have evolved to
insure justice.

and disturbing the peace.
They will be defending
themselves in a jury trial. They
have stated that it is their intent
to make the trial a political rather
than a legal event.
Subpoenas Served
In an organized move last

evening subpoenas requested by
the defendants were served on
SRI officials. The subpoenas
require presence in court so that
testimony on the demonstration
and the events leading up to it
may be taken.
Those served are SRI President
Charles Anderson; Homer Meaders
Jr., public relations director;
Weldon Gibson, executive
vice-president and director of SRI
International; Lloyd Schuknecht
and Milton Nurom of SRI
security; Vice-President for
Economics Kenneth Beggs; and
Gordon Parker, executive assistant
to the president.
An additional subpoena was
served on Ernest Arbuckle, trustee
of both Stanford and SRI and

former dean of the Graduate
School of Business.
Court Motions
Other legal activity has
centered on a defendant-filed
discovery motion seeking police
radio tapes in addition to other
prosecution evidence. A discovery
motion, once approved by the
court, must be complied with in
five days. That time period has
elapsed, and the tapes have still
not been released.
After being questioned by the
defendants, the District Attorney
suggested they file a "show cause"
order against the police. This step
is still under consideration.
A similar motion had been
filed by attorneys for the other 85
defendants. They will seek a court
order today demanding the tapes.
Named in this action will be Palo
Alto Mayor Arnold, City Manager
Morgan, Chief of Police Hydie,
Detective Goodyear, and the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney.
Several A3M members
speculated that the tapes will
show a conscious effort by the
police to arrest radicals while
leaving members of the Young
Americans for Freedom and the
Coalition for an Academic
Community untouched. The YAF
and CAC members were present in
an effort to help obtain evidence
for the police by observing and
taking photographs of the events
which occurred.
Further Trials
Monday's trial will be followed
by others in September. The
charges range from trespass to
assualt and from failure to
disperse to motor vehicle code
violations.
Most of the trials will be for
groups of defendants. The
groupings are based on the
similarities in the charges and in
the time of occurrence.
Members of the A3M have
stated the opinion that they are
being tied up in court in an effort
to prevent further political
activity by radical students. They
also point out that over $30,000
is being tied up in bail—money
that they could use for leaflets
and other expenses.
Student Opinion
When asked to comment on
the use of the courts by the A3M,
one Stanford student expressed
these views:
"Although this gives the
trustees and others a taste of their
own medicine, leftists serving
subpoenas are co-operating with
the police state. This is a clear
case of subpoenas envy. The Palo
Alto pigs and Friedenthal's
judicial council use subpoenas;
now the trial defendants are
crypto-piglets with their own
subpoenas, very like Harvey
Hukari and his blue-buttoned
hayakawas."
In reply one A3M member said
that she felt that this use of
subpoenas and court motions
came out of the common law
tradition which people have used
throughout history. She went on
to distinguish between laws
written to support the ruling class
and laws that have evolved to
insure justice.
