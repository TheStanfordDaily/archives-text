The first of several trials arising
out of the arrests of April Third
Movement (A3M) members for
the demonstration and work
stoppage at the Stanford Research
Institute Hanover facility May 16
starts Monday. Jeanne Friedman,
Myron Filene, and Scott Johnson
are each charged with inciting to
riot, unlawful assembly,
obstructing a public area, trespass,
and disturbing the peace.
They will be defending
themselves in a jury trial. They
have stated that it is their intent
to make the trial a political rather
than a legal event.
Subpoenas Served
In an organized move last

evening subpoenas requested by
the defendants were served on
SRI officials. The subpoenas
require presence in court so that
testimony on the demonstration
and the events leading up to it
may be taken.
Those served are SRI President
Charles Anderson; Homer Meaders
Jr., public relations director;
Weldon Gibson, executive
vice-president and director of SRI
International; Lloyd Schuknecht
and Milton Nurom of SRI
security; Vice-President for
Economics Kenneth Beggs; and
Gordon Parker, executive assistant
to the president.
An additional subpoena was
served on Ernest Arbuckle, trustee
of both Stanford and SRI and

former dean of the Graduate
School of Business.
Court Motions
Other legal activity has
centered on a defendant-filed
discovery motion seeking police
radio tapes in addition to other
prosecution evidence. A discovery
motion, once approved by the
court, must be complied with in
five days. That time period has
elapsed, and the tapes have still
not been released.
After being questioned by the
defendants, the District Attorney
suggested they file a "show cause"
order against the police. This step
is still under consideration.
A similar motion had been
filed by attorneys for the other 85
defendants. They will seek a court
order today demanding the tapes.
Named in this action will be Palo
Alto Mayor Arnold, City Manager
Morgan, Chief of Police Hydie,
Detective Goodyear, and the
Santa Clara County District
Attorney.
Several A3M members
speculated that the tapes will
show a conscious effort by the
police to arrest radicals while
leaving members of the Young
Americans for Freedom and the
Coalition for an Academic
Community untouched. The YAF
and CAC members were present in
an effort to help obtain evidence
for the police by observing and
taking photographs of the events
which occurred.
Further Trials
Monday's trial will be followed
by others in September. The
charges range from trespass to
assualt and from failure to
disperse to motor vehicle code
violations.
Most of the trials will be for
groups of defendants. The
groupings are based on the
