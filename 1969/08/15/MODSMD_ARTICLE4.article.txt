# Rapes And Petty Theft Increase
## 
### RICK ATKINS PAUL DE LIBAN 
Two rapes took place on the Stanford
campus during the summer months
according to Director of Public Safety, Dan
DeYoung.
The first incident occurred in the Wilbur
Hall section occupied by women students.
The victim, according to DeYoung, awoke
in the middle of the night to find a strange
man beside her bed. "There was no
evidence of breaking and entering,"
DeYoung said, "but I can't remember off
hand whether or not she locked her door."
According to the girl involved, who was
contacted by The Daily last night, the
intruder entered via the door to her room.
She was not told when she moved into
Wilbur Hall that the inside lock to her door
malfunctioned, and that in order to lock it,
one had to do so from the outside. The
incident took place between 2 a.m. and 3
a.m. and the assailant left immediately
thereafter via that door. The victim,
confused and overwhelmed, did not report
the incident for approximately eight hours.
Her physical condition was evaluated the
next day by a noted Palo Alto
gynecologist.
The second victim chose not to enter a
formal complaint with the police, so the
information surrounding that incident is
rather meager. "If in fact medical
evaluation was sought regarding the
incidents, both girls would have pursued it
on their own," DeYoung remarked.
DeYoung stated that the amount of
police protection on campus would not be
increased as a result of the incidents, nor
would there be, to his knowledge, a greater
number of Santa Clara County deputies on
Stanford grounds. "I don't know how
many plainclothesmen are on the campus

at any one time," said DeYoung, "and I
don't know that the sheriff would tell me
if I asked. I only know that there is one
uniformed officer for four hours per day
whose chief duty is to pursue moving
traffic violators."
DeYoung suggested that improvements
in street lighting might help to solve the
crime problem on campus. Students should
further be encouraged to keep their doors
and windows locked at night and when not
in their rooms. Wallets and pocketbooks
should not be left unattended, particularly
in gym locker rooms. "There are literally
hundreds of cases of recorded petty theft
which could have been prevented had these
simple steps been taken."
There are more police at Stanford than
there were a year ago, and there are
presently five beats on campus. "But let's
face it," DeYoung contended, "this is a
hell of a big campus, and it's impossible to
protect all of it all of the time." Several
police cars have occasionally been noticed
late at night on the knoll facing the back of
Florence Moore Hall, presumably to affect
the safety of the women students living
there. When questioned about the frequent
stakeout, DeYoung responded, "The men
probably stopped there to keep an eye on
what was going on."
DeYoung viewed the rapes as something
other than a violation of the campus policy
on disruptions. "They're really felonies,"
he added. "It's rough for you and me as
human beings to realize that girls aren't
safe any more. The FBI announced
recently that the overall crime rate has
climbed some 17%, and I suppose that
rapes are included in that figure, too. You

Although Stanford's crime rate has risen
over the summer, it is only following the
national trend.
The greatest increase has been in thefts
from locked vehicles (burglaries). If the
vehicle is unlocked and items are stolen it
is probably a petty theft. Stereo tape decks
are the most popular targets of I he thieves.
If a thief knows what he's 'Joing it takes
only five minutes according to Stanford
Police Captain William Wullschleger.
In June, 12 owners of vehicles were
victims; only three of these thefts involved
parts of the vehicles themselves. Auto
parts, tools, cameras, stereo tape decks,
tapes, clothing, portable auto radio, watch,
and money were among items taken from
cars over the summer. In July, such losses
totaled $1173.
Also during June, six thefts, usually of
wallets and other valuables taken from
purses (left unattended to) from academic
buildings were reported. The wallets
usually turn up later, but Wullschleger
cautions women to lock up valuables in
their desks if they don't take their purses
with them.
In one of the 12 vehicle accidents during
June and July, one minor injury occurred.
Four were reported last summer.
Since September 1968, two rapes and
one attempt have been reported. The
attempt was foiled when the victim
screamed at a passing bicyclist as her
attacker dragged her into some bushes. Her
assailant fled when she screamed.
The Stanford police offer to engrave
owners' names on items of value was
accepted by only three or four people,
Wullschleger commented. Many people
don't even know the make or model of

their valuables, nor arc the serial numbers
recorded, he added, which makes positive
identification of recovered items very
difficult. Keeping such records will help in
identification. Stanford police perform the
engraving service free of charge three days
a week.
Comparative statistics for academic
years (September-June) 1967-68 and
1968-69 show the rising crime trend. In
1968-69, 88 vehicle burglaries occurred,
while the previous year produced 49. A
total of 471 thefts hit Stanford this year,
while 388 were reported last year. The
vehicle accident rate increases from 129 to
134, but injury accidents dropped from 49
to 40. Three more vehicles were stolen this
year (51) and 39 (not necessarily the same
as those stolen) recovered. No drunken
driving has been reported since September
1967.
Stanford police arrested 37 people this
year, contrasted to 15 the previous year.
The increase of the Stanford force to 35
uniformed officers contributed to the
increase in arrests.
Since many of the crimes committed on
campus are felonies, they are investigated
by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office
after Stanford police report the offenses to
them. Stanford only investigates
misdemeanors.
Two sergeants will be added to next
year's Stanford force, bringing the total to
five. Four will patrol and supervise, the
other man will handle training of Stanford
policemen. Of the ten applicants who took
the written test, six will go on to the oral
examination August 20. This will bring the
strength of fhe Stanford Police Department
to 43, including office personnel.

owners' names on items of value was
accepted by only three or four people,
Wullschleger commented. Many people
don't even know the make or model of

their valuables, nor arc the serial numbers
recorded, he added, which makes positive
identification of recovered items very
difficult. Keeping such records will help in
identification. Stanford police perform the
engraving service free of charge three days
a week.
Comparative statistics for academic
years (September-June) 1967-68 and
1968-69 show the rising crime trend. In
1968-69, 88 vehicle burglaries occurred,
while the previous year produced 49. A
total of 471 thefts hit Stanford this year,
while 388 were reported last year. The
vehicle accident rate increases from 129 to
134, but injury accidents dropped from 49
to 40. Three more vehicles were stolen this
year (51) and 39 (not necessarily the same
as those stolen) recovered. No drunken
driving has been reported since September
1967.
Stanford police arrested 37 people this
year, contrasted to 15 the previous year.
The increase of the Stanford force to 35
uniformed officers contributed to the
increase in arrests.
Since many of the crimes committed on
campus are felonies, they are investigated
by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office
after Stanford police report the offenses to
them. Stanford only investigates
misdemeanors.
Two sergeants will be added to next
year's Stanford force, bringing the total to
five. Four will patrol and supervise, the
other man will handle training of Stanford
policemen. Of the ten applicants who took
the written test, six will go on to the oral
examination August 20. This will bring the
strength of fhe Stanford Police Department
to 43, including office personnel.

of visitors to the Stanford campus
from the outside, and some of
these people have less of a regard
for others than you or I do. Rapes
have always happened and always
will because of people's interest in
it."
Two rapes took place on the Stanford
campus during the summer months
according to Director of Public Safety, Dan
DeYoung.
The first incident occurred in the Wilbur
Hall section occupied by women students.
The victim, according to DeYoung, awoke
in the middle of the night to find a strange
man beside her bed. "There was no
evidence of breaking and entering,"
DeYoung said, "but I can't remember off
hand whether or not she locked her door."
According to the girl involved, who was
contacted by The Daily last night, the
intruder entered via the door to her room.
She was not told when she moved into
Wilbur Hall that the inside lock to her door
malfunctioned, and that in order to lock it,
one had to do so from the outside. The
incident took place between 2 a.m. and 3
a.m. and the assailant left immediately
thereafter via that door. The victim,
confused and overwhelmed, did not report
the incident for approximately eight hours.
Her physical condition was evaluated the
next day by a noted Palo Alto
gynecologist.
The second victim chose not to enter a
formal complaint with the police, so the
information surrounding that incident is
rather meager. "If in fact medical
evaluation was sought regarding the
incidents, both girls would have pursued it
on their own," DeYoung remarked.
DeYoung stated that the amount of
police protection on campus would not be
increased as a result of the incidents, nor
would there be, to his knowledge, a greater
number of Santa Clara County deputies on
Stanford grounds. "I don't know how
many plainclothesmen are on the campus

at any one time," said DeYoung, "and I
don't know that the sheriff would tell me
if I asked. I only know that there is one
uniformed officer for four hours per day
whose chief duty is to pursue moving
traffic violators."
DeYoung suggested that improvements
in street lighting might help to solve the
crime problem on campus. Students should
further be encouraged to keep their doors
and windows locked at night and when not
in their rooms. Wallets and pocketbooks
should not be left unattended, particularly
in gym locker rooms. "There are literally
hundreds of cases of recorded petty theft
which could have been prevented had these
simple steps been taken."
There are more police at Stanford than
there were a year ago, and there are
presently five beats on campus. "But let's
face it," DeYoung contended, "this is a
hell of a big campus, and it's impossible to
protect all of it all of the time." Several
police cars have occasionally been noticed
late at night on the knoll facing the back of
Florence Moore Hall, presumably to affect
the safety of the women students living
there. When questioned about the frequent
stakeout, DeYoung responded, "The men
probably stopped there to keep an eye on
what was going on."
DeYoung viewed the rapes as something
other than a violation of the campus policy
on disruptions. "They're really felonies,"
he added. "It's rough for you and me as
human beings to realize that girls aren't
safe any more. The FBI announced
recently that the overall crime rate has
climbed some 17%, and I suppose that
rapes are included in that figure, too. You

Although Stanford's crime rate has risen
over the summer, it is only following the
national trend.
The greatest increase has been in thefts
from locked vehicles (burglaries). If the
vehicle is unlocked and items are stolen it
is probably a petty theft. Stereo tape decks
are the most popular targets of I he thieves.
If a thief knows what he's 'Joing it takes
only five minutes according to Stanford
Police Captain William Wullschleger.
In June, 12 owners of vehicles were
victims; only three of these thefts involved
parts of the vehicles themselves. Auto
parts, tools, cameras, stereo tape decks,
tapes, clothing, portable auto radio, watch,
and money were among items taken from
cars over the summer. In July, such losses
totaled $1173.
Also during June, six thefts, usually of
wallets and other valuables taken from
purses (left unattended to) from academic
buildings were reported. The wallets
usually turn up later, but Wullschleger
cautions women to lock up valuables in
their desks if they don't take their purses
with them.
In one of the 12 vehicle accidents during
June and July, one minor injury occurred.
Four were reported last summer.
Since September 1968, two rapes and
one attempt have been reported. The
attempt was foiled when the victim
screamed at a passing bicyclist as her
attacker dragged her into some bushes. Her
assailant fled when she screamed.

late at night on the knoll facing the back of
Florence Moore Hall, presumably to affect
the safety of the women students living
there. When questioned about the frequent
stakeout, DeYoung responded, "The men
probably stopped there to keep an eye on
what was going on."
DeYoung viewed the rapes as something
other than a violation of the campus policy
on disruptions. "They're really felonies,"
he added. "It's rough for you and me as
human beings to realize that girls aren't
safe any more. The FBI announced
recently that the overall crime rate has
climbed some 17%, and I suppose that
rapes are included in that figure, too. You

Although Stanford's crime rate has risen
over the summer, it is only following the
national trend.
The greatest increase has been in thefts
from locked vehicles (burglaries). If the
vehicle is unlocked and items are stolen it
is probably a petty theft. Stereo tape decks
are the most popular targets of I he thieves.
If a thief knows what he's 'Joing it takes
only five minutes according to Stanford
Police Captain William Wullschleger.
In June, 12 owners of vehicles were
victims; only three of these thefts involved
parts of the vehicles themselves. Auto
parts, tools, cameras, stereo tape decks,
tapes, clothing, portable auto radio, watch,
and money were among items taken from
cars over the summer. In July, such losses
totaled $1173.
Also during June, six thefts, usually of
wallets and other valuables taken from
purses (left unattended to) from academic
buildings were reported. The wallets
usually turn up later, but Wullschleger
cautions women to lock up valuables in
their desks if they don't take their purses
with them.
In one of the 12 vehicle accidents during
June and July, one minor injury occurred.
Four were reported last summer.
Since September 1968, two rapes and
one attempt have been reported. The
attempt was foiled when the victim
screamed at a passing bicyclist as her
attacker dragged her into some bushes. Her
assailant fled when she screamed.
The Stanford police offer to engrave
owners' names on items of value was
accepted by only three or four people,
Wullschleger commented. Many people
don't even know the make or model of

their valuables, nor arc the serial numbers
recorded, he added, which makes positive
identification of recovered items very
difficult. Keeping such records will help in
identification. Stanford police perform the
engraving service free of charge three days
a week.
Comparative statistics for academic
years (September-June) 1967-68 and
1968-69 show the rising crime trend. In
1968-69, 88 vehicle burglaries occurred,
while the previous year produced 49. A
total of 471 thefts hit Stanford this year,
while 388 were reported last year. The
vehicle accident rate increases from 129 to
134, but injury accidents dropped from 49
to 40. Three more vehicles were stolen this
year (51) and 39 (not necessarily the same
as those stolen) recovered. No drunken
driving has been reported since September
1967.
Stanford police arrested 37 people this
year, contrasted to 15 the previous year.
The increase of the Stanford force to 35
uniformed officers contributed to the
increase in arrests.
Since many of the crimes committed on
campus are felonies, they are investigated
by the Santa Clara County Sheriff's office
after Stanford police report the offenses to
them. Stanford only investigates
misdemeanors.
Two sergeants will be added to next
year's Stanford force, bringing the total to
five. Four will patrol and supervise, the
other man will handle training of Stanford
policemen. Of the ten applicants who took
the written test, six will go on to the oral
examination August 20. This will bring the
strength of fhe Stanford Police Department
to 43, including office personnel.

of visitors to the Stanford campus
from the outside, and some of
these people have less of a regard
for others than you or I do. Rapes
have always happened and always
will because of people's interest in
it."
Two rapes took place on the Stanford
campus during the summer months
according to Director of Public Safety, Dan
DeYoung.
The first incident occurred in the Wilbur
Hall section occupied by women students.
The victim, according to DeYoung, awoke
in the middle of the night to find a strange
man beside her bed. "There was no
evidence of breaking and entering,"
DeYoung said, "but I can't remember off
hand whether or not she locked her door."
According to the girl involved, who was
contacted by The Daily last night, the
intruder entered via the door to her room.
She was not told when she moved into
Wilbur Hall that the inside lock to her door
malfunctioned, and that in order to lock it,
one had to do so from the outside. The
incident took place between 2 a.m. and 3
a.m. and the assailant left immediately
thereafter via that door. The victim,
confused and overwhelmed, did not report
the incident for approximately eight hours.
Her physical condition was evaluated the
next day by a noted Palo Alto
gynecologist.
The second victim chose not to enter a
formal complaint with the police, so the
information surrounding that incident is
rather meager. "If in fact medical
evaluation was sought regarding the
incidents, both girls would have pursued it
on their own," DeYoung remarked.
DeYoung stated that the amount of
police protection on campus would not be
increased as a result of the incidents, nor
would there be, to his knowledge, a greater
number of Santa Clara County deputies on
Stanford grounds. "I don't know how
many plainclothesmen are on the campus

at any one time," said DeYoung, "and I
don't know that the sheriff would tell me
if I asked. I only know that there is one
uniformed officer for four hours per day
whose chief duty is to pursue moving
traffic violators."
DeYoung suggested that improvements
in street lighting might help to solve the
crime problem on campus. Students should
further be encouraged to keep their doors
and windows locked at night and when not
in their rooms. Wallets and pocketbooks
should not be left unattended, particularly
in gym locker rooms. "There are literally
hundreds of cases of recorded petty theft
which could have been prevented had these
simple steps been taken."
There are more police at Stanford than
there were a year ago, and there are
presently five beats on campus. "But let's
face it," DeYoung contended, "this is a
hell of a big campus, and it's impossible to
protect all of it all of the time." Several
police cars have occasionally been noticed
late at night on the knoll facing the back of
