One might suspect that a Daily editorial would be
suggesting that you read the Pacific Study Center's Pacific
Research and World Empire Telegram or Dave Jones' Cross
Currents. Instead we are recommending one of the big
three in glossy American magazines. It should be shown to
parents, alumni, and others.
The August 26 issue of Look continues the magazine's
feature on American militarism with stories on the defense
establishment, generals and the contractors, waste in the
federal budget, and one entitled "The University Arsenal."
On page 34 Ruth Gelmis considers Stanford as being
"deeply enmeshed in the defense establishment." She
relates the episode of the March 11 open Trustee Forum
and the confrontation over values that arose. A discussion
of the Trustees' activities in the Third World concludes
with:
"Counterinsurgency is not the brainchild of these
directors, hut it protects their interests very well. "
"Law is perhaps the most pernicious of all weapons in political struggles
precisely because of Ihe halo that surrounds the concept of right and
justice. When it becomes "political", justice breeds hatred and despair
among those it singles out for attack. Those whom it favors, on the other
hand, develop a profound contempt for the very value of justice; they
know it can be purchased by the powerful. As a device for strengthening
one political group at the expense of others, for eliminating enemies and
assisting political allies, law then threatens the fundamental conventions
upon which the tradition of our civilization rest.
The technical possibilities of perverting justice for political ends are
widespread in every legal system . . ."
