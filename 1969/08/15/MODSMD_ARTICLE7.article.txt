To the Editor:
I would appreciate your printing the following
letter which I sent to the Stanford Annual Fund:
Dear Friends:
In catching up on some accumulated mail, I
find two letters, dated March and April of this
year, requesting that I contribute a financial gift to
the Stanford Annual Fund. Although Stanford is
proud to consider itself one of the finer
universities in the country, I have grave
reservations about the consequences of Stanford's
stature. Specifically, I am extremely bothered by
the increasingly complex and clandestine
connections that Stanford has with the federal
government. I am bothered by the implications of
research projects, whether contracted or not,
whether classified or not, undertaken by
Stanford's various scientific laboratories, by the
Stanford Research Institute, and by the Hoover
Institution. Too much of this research is oriented
toward tacit, if not enthusiastic, support of federal
programs and policies which I consider detrimental
or immoral. My information is that Stanford is
involved in research projects dealing with
dispersion of "crowd control" gases, with
germicide warfare, and with counter-insurgency in
Thailand. In short, these projects, under the clever
guise of academic neutralism or scientific
curiosity, are heavily supportive of militarism and
political repression. To me this is unacceptable. It

seems that these research efforts are contributing
to an already unimaginably frightful potential for
destruction. They accentuate the problems we face
and bear only fear and despair. If this research,
and the university which sponsors it, are not part
of the solution, then they are part of the problem.
Thus they promote a joyless climate of nihilism
that fails to account for human needs and human
priorities.
Incidentally, I do not think that the trustees'
recent decision to sell the Stanford Research
Institute is the way toward moral cleansing. On
the contrary, I feel that Stanford should retain
ownership and control of the Institute and then
make it an agent of life rather than death.
I have wondered what I can personally do to
encourage Stanford to cease its involvements in
death and destruction. As I understand it, the
contributions to the Annual Fund will be used for
scholarships, professors' salaries and library
acquisitions—all worthy purposes. However, I have
decided that I cannot make a donation to an
institution so heavily at odds with my ideals.
There will be no check enclosed with this letter or
in response to future letters soliciting my support.
When I am satisfied that Stanford has changed its
focus, then I will gladly and proudly make a
financial gift to an institution of hope.

find two letters, dated March and April of this
year, requesting that I contribute a financial gift to
the Stanford Annual Fund. Although Stanford is
proud to consider itself one of the finer
universities in the country, I have grave
reservations about the consequences of Stanford's
stature. Specifically, I am extremely bothered by
the increasingly complex and clandestine
connections that Stanford has with the federal
government. I am bothered by the implications of
research projects, whether contracted or not,
whether classified or not, undertaken by
Stanford's various scientific laboratories, by the
Stanford Research Institute, and by the Hoover
Institution. Too much of this research is oriented
toward tacit, if not enthusiastic, support of federal
programs and policies which I consider detrimental
or immoral. My information is that Stanford is
involved in research projects dealing with
dispersion of "crowd control" gases, with
germicide warfare, and with counter-insurgency in
Thailand. In short, these projects, under the clever
guise of academic neutralism or scientific
curiosity, are heavily supportive of militarism and
political repression. To me this is unacceptable. It

seems that these research efforts are contributing
to an already unimaginably frightful potential for
destruction. They accentuate the problems we face
and bear only fear and despair. If this research,
and the university which sponsors it, are not part
of the solution, then they are part of the problem.
Thus they promote a joyless climate of nihilism
that fails to account for human needs and human
priorities.
Incidentally, I do not think that the trustees'
recent decision to sell the Stanford Research
Institute is the way toward moral cleansing. On
the contrary, I feel that Stanford should retain
ownership and control of the Institute and then
make it an agent of life rather than death.
I have wondered what I can personally do to
encourage Stanford to cease its involvements in
death and destruction. As I understand it, the
contributions to the Annual Fund will be used for
scholarships, professors' salaries and library
acquisitions—all worthy purposes. However, I have
decided that I cannot make a donation to an
institution so heavily at odds with my ideals.
There will be no check enclosed with this letter or
in response to future letters soliciting my support.
When I am satisfied that Stanford has changed its
focus, then I will gladly and proudly make a
financial gift to an institution of hope.
