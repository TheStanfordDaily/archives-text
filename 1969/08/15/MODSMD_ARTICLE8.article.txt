## The 						Movement In Court 
### Leonard Siegel 
When the first three defendants
from the A3M/SRI-Hanover
demonstration go on trial
Monday, the script won't be quite
like "Perry Mason", or even "The
Defenders." The courts of
America are not neutral arbiters
of the truth, as our high school
civics textbooks would have us
believe. Rather they are political
institutions, designed to protect
the interests of the powerful. The
Law, the selective enforcement of
the Law, and the courtroom itself
are all part of the same system.
No society can exist without
laws of some kind. Many laws
today, such as the vehicle code,
clearly serve the people. Others
could, if enforced properly. But
there are laws authorizing the
forceful eviction of tenants, yet
there is no rent control (with a
few exceptions). Striking workers
can be enjoined from picketing,
but their employers can sell
unsafe products with false or

"The law, in its majestic equality, forbids the rich as well
as the poor to sleep under bridges, to beg in the streets, and
to steal bread."

misleading advertising. I cannot
drink beer legally, but I can be
drafted. And an SRI researcher
can plot the scenario for years of
death and destruction through
war and counterinsurgency, while
our friends are arrested for
disturbing the 'peace' —standing
in an intersection. These are laws
of the rich and powerful, for the
rich and powerful, by the rich and
powerful.
But because our Constitution
guarantees civil liberties, and
because our country has a
democratic heritage, our statutes
are not the worst in the world. On
paper we have "equal justice
before the law." But any Stanford
student knows this is hogwash. We
can get away with a lot more than
someone who does not have such
a privileged class position.
In political cases statutes can
also be applied arbitrarily, serving
the political needs of those in
power. According to the

prosecution and police, any A3M
sympathizer on May 16 committed
"unlawful assembly," "trespass,"
or "riot." Any YAFer,
photographer, or bystander who
didn't support the goals of the
April Third Movement was going
about his legal business.
We will go into the courtroom
over the next few months
defending our acts. We will raise
the questions above, and many
more! But the prosecutor —
although he will try to scare the
jury with our politics and
associations—will deny that these
cases are political trials. He will
insist that the only questions are
t e chnical—whether specific
individuals committed specific
acts. And the judge will probably
instruct the jury that such facts
are the only basis for a verdict.
Yet we will defend ourselves
politically. We will explain to the
juries and the courtroom why we
went to SRI, and why we will do
it again.

individuals committed specific
acts. And the judge will probably
instruct the jury that such facts
are the only basis for a verdict.
Yet we will defend ourselves
politically. We will explain to the
juries and the courtroom why we
went to SRI, and why we will do
it again.

When the first three defendants
from the A3M/SRI-Hanover
demonstration go on trial
Monday, the script won't be quite
like "Perry Mason", or even "The
Defenders." The courts of
America are not neutral arbiters
of the truth, as our high school
civics textbooks would have us
believe. Rather they are political
institutions, designed to protect
the interests of the powerful. The
Law, the selective enforcement of
the Law, and the courtroom itself
are all part of the same system.
No society can exist without
laws of some kind. Many laws
today, such as the vehicle code,
clearly serve the people. Others
could, if enforced properly. But
there are laws authorizing the
forceful eviction of tenants, yet
there is no rent control (with a
few exceptions). Striking workers
can be enjoined from picketing,
but their employers can sell
unsafe products with false or

misleading advertising. I cannot
drink beer legally, but I can be
drafted. And an SRI researcher
can plot the scenario for years of
death and destruction through
war and counterinsurgency, while
our friends are arrested for
disturbing the 'peace' —standing
in an intersection. These are laws
of the rich and powerful, for the
rich and powerful, by the rich and
powerful.
But because our Constitution
guarantees civil liberties, and
because our country has a
democratic heritage, our statutes
are not the worst in the world. On
paper we have "equal justice
before the law." But any Stanford
student knows this is hogwash. We
can get away with a lot more than
someone who does not have such
a privileged class position.
In political cases statutes can
also be applied arbitrarily, serving
the political needs of those in
power. According to the

prosecution and police, any A3M
sympathizer on May 16 committed
"unlawful assembly," "trespass,"
or "riot." Any YAFer,
photographer, or bystander who
didn't support the goals of the
April Third Movement was going
about his legal business.
We will go into the courtroom
over the next few months
defending our acts. We will raise
the questions above, and many
more! But the prosecutor —
although he will try to scare the
jury with our politics and
associations—will deny that these
cases are political trials. He will
insist that the only questions are
t e chnical—whether specific
individuals committed specific
acts. And the judge will probably
instruct the jury that such facts
are the only basis for a verdict.
