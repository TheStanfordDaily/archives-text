Start the academic year off with a gesture of financial independence...
visit your local branch of Bank of America. Get acquainted with our student
advisor who's there to help you with such banking needs as getting
your checking account started. He'll probably recommend our Tenplan
account because it's designed for student customers who usually write
less than 10 checks per month. With it you obtain personalized checks
and there's no minimum balance required. Just one charge of 15c for
each check you write. (And now, Bank of America's new scenic checks are
available at a moderate additional cost.) So check with us-and save!
