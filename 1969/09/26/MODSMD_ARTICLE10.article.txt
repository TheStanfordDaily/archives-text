## What's Disrupted? 
### John Spiegel Brad Cornell 
Student protest has already contributed to the coming year at
Stanford by enlivening our annual back-to-school
much-ado-about-nothing.
The notable feature of the expectant atmosphere which invariably
surrounds the beginning of the school year is that now for the first
time apprehension over campus unrest seems to rival speculation over
the college football season.
Editors, educators, and politicians across the broadest political
spectrum —from Reagan to Lowenstein, from the National Review to
the New Republic —have warned that student violence will not be
tolerated in the coming academic year. In the face of this chorus
condemning campus disruptions, one must ask just what is being
disrupted.
Academy or Factory?
Those who cry for the preservation of the university's intellectual
atmosphere suggest an image of a Platonic academy whose members
are passionately committed to the understanding of man and the
universe and are frustrated in their disinterested pursuit of knowledge
by the "violent disruptions" of the radical barbarians.
On closer inspection, however, the image of the Platonic academy
recedes before that of the factory. American higher education is the
crucial step in the training and selection process which produces the
human material required for the functioning of the corporate state.
This process is a kind of institutionalized carrot and stick, which holds
out the promise of a well-paying, high-status job and at the same time
the threat of failure, with all that implies in our society.
Status Competition
In general, the motivating force behind the "good student ' is
status competition; his educational experience amounts to the
accumulation of credentials for a successful career. The motto of a
local college (which coincidentally had its first disruption last year) is
remarkably candid: "Education —Gateway to Achievement."
The classic ideal of education, relegated to commencement oratory
in today's multiuniversity, has been revived as a battle cry in the
counterattack against student radicalism.
Suddenly the mammoth complex of narrow academic departments
and government-contracted institutes, caught in the act of reaching
halfway around the globe to "pacify" Vietnam or drill for oil in
Kuwait, squeals that its contemplative serenity is being disturbed, that
its truth-seekers are being obstructed —or is it only that the peaceful
making of nerve gas is being interrupted?
