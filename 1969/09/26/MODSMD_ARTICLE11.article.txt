# Rough Draft Review
## What is the Choice? 
### Alan Strain 
All of you who are now
entering Stanford for the first
time, whether as freshmen or
transfers, are certainly aware of
the draft. If you are a male
student and a U.S. citizen or
permanent resident you now have
or soon will have some
relationship with the Selective
Service.
You are perhaps unaware,
however, of the pervasive
influence the draft may have on
basic decisions you make during
the next six or eight years.
You may already have decided
to be in college at this time or to
come to Stanford in particular
because of the draft. You may
choose your field of study or
change it with a future deferment
in mind. You may decide to enroll
in ROTC or some other reserve
program as a way to avoid being a

draftee. You may decide to go
into VISTA or the Peace Corps as
a way to extend your deferment
until at least age 24. You may
decide at some point to refuse to
cooperate with the requirements
of Selective Service and possibly
become a federal felon. And
psychiatrist Semous Halleck
suggests that because of the
premium the draft places on
physical or psychological illness,
you may even subconsciously
"decide" the state of your health
on the basis of the draft.
These wide ranging effects of
the draft on a variety of basic
decisions are no accident. The
Selective Service memo called
"Channeling," for several years
sent out in all Selective Service
public relations packets and
presently the basis of a chapter in
the course outline which Selective
Service makes available to high
schools, spells out in great detail
the "beneficial effects of
pressured motivation" which is
the American or indirect way of
achieving what is done by
direction in countries where
choice is not permitted."
This document includes a
number of remarkably frank
revelations.
"Delivery of manpower for
induction," it states, "the process
of providing a few thousand men
with transportation to a reception
center, is not much of an
administrative or financial
challenge. It is dealing with the
other millions of registrants that
the system is heavily occupied,
developing more effective human
beings in the national interest."
It declares, "The club of
induction has been used to drive
cut of areas considered to be less
important to the areas of greater
importance in which deferments
were given, the individuals who
did not or could not participate in
activities which were considered
essential to the defense of the
Nation.
. . ."From the individual's
viewpoint, he is standing in a
room which has been made
uncomfortably warm. Several
doors are open to him, but they
all lead to various forms of
patriotic service to the Nation.
Some accept the alternatives
gladly—some with reluctance. The
consequence is approximately the
same." the document concludes.
One consequence of "pressured
motivation" which was probably
not anticipated was the degree to

which sucn manipulation would
make the draft a major issue on
college campuses. There is some
indication that Congress and the
Administration now recognize this
as a real problem.
A basic result of President
Nixon's recent proposals and of
most draft reform legislation now
before Congress will be to limit
"the beneficial effects" of
channeling by limiting the period
of high liability to one year at as
early an age as possible.
However, there is no serious
possibility that student
deferments will be abandoned and
students enrolling at Stanford
should not count on any changes
in the law during the coming year
which will appreciably affect their
draft situation.
Whatever you decide to do
with respect to the draft should,
at the very least, be based on the
most complete and accurate
information you can get on the
alternatives you are considering
and the implications and
consequences of your decision.
For this reason the University
believes it has the responsibility to
make available the most complete
information possible about
Selective Service.
The Office of Special Services
in Old Union room 324 and room
3 in the Clubhouse is responsible
for providing such services.
Counseling relating to all
questions and concerns about
Selective Service as well as sample
forms and printed information
about the law and about Selective
Service procedures are available
from these offices.
Those of you who have not yet
registered —about 30 percent of all
entering freshmen—have a choice
about what local draft board will
have jurisdiction over you for as
long as you are subject to
Selective Service.
First of all, you may register in
Old Union room 324. At that
time, depending upon the address
you give Selective Service as your
permanent address, you may
establish as your local board the
one which has jurisdiction over
your address at Stanford, or the
board having jurisdiction over a
home address elsewhere.
Once registered, it is virtually
impossible to change your local
board, though you will be able to
transfer the location of a physical
examination, an appeal, or an
order to report for induction or
civilian work.

which sucn manipulation would

A basic result of President
Nixon's recent proposals and of

Whatever you decide to do
with respect to the draft should,
at the very least, be based on the
most complete and accurate
information you can get on the
alternatives you are considering
and the implications and
consequences of your decision.
For this reason the University
believes it has the responsibility to
make available the most complete
information possible about
Selective Service.
The Office of Special Services
in Old Union room 324 and room
3 in the Clubhouse is responsible
for providing such services.
Counseling relating to all
questions and concerns about
Selective Service as well as sample
forms and printed information
about the law and about Selective
Service procedures are available
from these offices.
Those of you who have not yet
registered —about 30 percent of all
entering freshmen—have a choice
about what local draft board will
have jurisdiction over you for as
long as you are subject to
Selective Service.
First of all, you may register in
Old Union room 324. At that
time, depending upon the address
you give Selective Service as your
permanent address, you may
establish as your local board the
one which has jurisdiction over
your address at Stanford, or the
board having jurisdiction over a
home address elsewhere.
Once registered, it is virtually
impossible to change your local
board, though you will be able to
transfer the location of a physical
examination, an appeal, or an
order to report for induction or
civilian work.
All of you who are now
entering Stanford for the first
time, whether as freshmen or
transfers, are certainly aware of
the draft. If you are a male
student and a U.S. citizen or
permanent resident you now have
or soon will have some
relationship with the Selective
Service.
You are perhaps unaware,
however, of the pervasive
influence the draft may have on
basic decisions you make during
the next six or eight years.
You may already have decided
to be in college at this time or to
come to Stanford in particular
because of the draft. You may
choose your field of study or
change it with a future deferment
in mind. You may decide to enroll
in ROTC or some other reserve
program as a way to avoid being a

draftee. You may decide to go
into VISTA or the Peace Corps as
a way to extend your deferment
until at least age 24. You may
decide at some point to refuse to
cooperate with the requirements
of Selective Service and possibly
become a federal felon. And
psychiatrist Semous Halleck
suggests that because of the
premium the draft places on
physical or psychological illness,
you may even subconsciously
"decide" the state of your health
on the basis of the draft.
These wide ranging effects of
the draft on a variety of basic
decisions are no accident. The
Selective Service memo called
"Channeling," for several years
sent out in all Selective Service
public relations packets and
presently the basis of a chapter in
the course outline which Selective
Service makes available to high
schools, spells out in great detail
the "beneficial effects of
pressured motivation" which is
the American or indirect way of
achieving what is done by
direction in countries where
choice is not permitted."
This document includes a
number of remarkably frank
revelations.
"Delivery of manpower for
induction," it states, "the process
of providing a few thousand men
with transportation to a reception
center, is not much of an
administrative or financial
challenge. It is dealing with the
other millions of registrants that
the system is heavily occupied,
developing more effective human
beings in the national interest."

Old Union room 324. At that
time, depending upon the address
you give Selective Service as your
permanent address, you may
establish as your local board the
one which has jurisdiction over
your address at Stanford, or the
board having jurisdiction over a
home address elsewhere.
Once registered, it is virtually
impossible to change your local
board, though you will be able to
transfer the location of a physical
examination, an appeal, or an
order to report for induction or
civilian work.
All of you who are now
entering Stanford for the first
time, whether as freshmen or
transfers, are certainly aware of
the draft. If you are a male
student and a U.S. citizen or
permanent resident you now have
or soon will have some
relationship with the Selective
Service.
You are perhaps unaware,
however, of the pervasive
influence the draft may have on
basic decisions you make during
the next six or eight years.
You may already have decided
to be in college at this time or to
come to Stanford in particular
because of the draft. You may
choose your field of study or
change it with a future deferment
in mind. You may decide to enroll
in ROTC or some other reserve
program as a way to avoid being a

draftee. You may decide to go
into VISTA or the Peace Corps as
a way to extend your deferment
until at least age 24. You may
decide at some point to refuse to
cooperate with the requirements
of Selective Service and possibly
become a federal felon. And
psychiatrist Semous Halleck
suggests that because of the
premium the draft places on
physical or psychological illness,
you may even subconsciously
"decide" the state of your health
on the basis of the draft.
These wide ranging effects of
the draft on a variety of basic
decisions are no accident. The
Selective Service memo called
"Channeling," for several years
sent out in all Selective Service
public relations packets and
presently the basis of a chapter in
the course outline which Selective
Service makes available to high
schools, spells out in great detail
the "beneficial effects of
pressured motivation" which is
the American or indirect way of
achieving what is done by
direction in countries where
choice is not permitted."
This document includes a
number of remarkably frank
revelations.
"Delivery of manpower for
induction," it states, "the process
of providing a few thousand men
with transportation to a reception
center, is not much of an
administrative or financial
challenge. It is dealing with the
other millions of registrants that
the system is heavily occupied,
developing more effective human
beings in the national interest."
It declares, "The club of
induction has been used to drive
cut of areas considered to be less
important to the areas of greater
importance in which deferments
were given, the individuals who
did not or could not participate in
activities which were considered
essential to the defense of the
Nation.
. . ."From the individual's
viewpoint, he is standing in a
room which has been made
uncomfortably warm. Several
doors are open to him, but they
all lead to various forms of
patriotic service to the Nation.
Some accept the alternatives
gladly—some with reluctance. The
consequence is approximately the
same." the document concludes.
One consequence of "pressured
motivation" which was probably
not anticipated was the degree to

which sucn manipulation would
make the draft a major issue on
college campuses. There is some
indication that Congress and the
Administration now recognize this
as a real problem.
A basic result of President
Nixon's recent proposals and of
most draft reform legislation now
before Congress will be to limit
"the beneficial effects" of
channeling by limiting the period
of high liability to one year at as
early an age as possible.
However, there is no serious
possibility that student
deferments will be abandoned and
students enrolling at Stanford
should not count on any changes
in the law during the coming year
which will appreciably affect their
draft situation.
Whatever you decide to do
with respect to the draft should,
at the very least, be based on the
most complete and accurate
information you can get on the
alternatives you are considering
and the implications and
consequences of your decision.
For this reason the University
believes it has the responsibility to
make available the most complete
information possible about
Selective Service.
The Office of Special Services
in Old Union room 324 and room
3 in the Clubhouse is responsible
for providing such services.
Counseling relating to all
questions and concerns about
Selective Service as well as sample
forms and printed information
about the law and about Selective
Service procedures are available
from these offices.
Those of you who have not yet
registered —about 30 percent of all
entering freshmen—have a choice
about what local draft board will
have jurisdiction over you for as
long as you are subject to
Selective Service.
