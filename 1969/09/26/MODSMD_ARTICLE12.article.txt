### ANDY ISRAEL 
Get your motor running . . .get
out on the highway . . .looking for
adventure or whatever conies our
way. Anyone denying the
adventure of trying to compress
the combined masses of three
footlockers, a complete home
entertainment center, six dozen
tapes, five posters, four blankets,
three people, two hundred road
maps, and a partridge in a pear
tree into the trunk and other
apertures of a 1958 Nash-Rambler
(really Dad shouldn't we take the
Edsel) must be the legendary man
with soul so dead.
Packing for school is a trauma
akin only to the terror of realizing
that you are not really sure if you
are physically, emotionally, and
morally prepared to climb to a
fourth floor penthouse dorm
room with your life's posssessions
in your hands.
* * *
Points of interest on the route
to school are always groovy. "Is
that a patrol car up ahead?" "No,
Dad, it's a gold Chevy with a
white top." "You're in a lot of
trouble if it is a cop," (as he
pressed his foot to the
floorboards).

* * *
"We have a great football
squad this year," I announced as
the grapevines whizzed past at
75mph.
"The kids on our block had a
football when I was a kid,"
remarked my old man, "but the
cop cut it apart cause we weren't
supposed to be playing ball in the
park."
"What do you mean 'cut it
apart'?"
"Well he took his pocket knife
and zzzippp."
"Zzzippp? Didn't you call the
ACLU or something?"
"Not in those days. . .we
weren't really too upset, it was a
pigskin and we were all Jewish
anyway."
* * *
They weren't too surprised at
my intention to try and join the
paper. "It runs in the family you
know, I was a gossip columnist
when I was in high school." "You
never told me that, mom." "Sure,
they gave me the pen and scroll
award." I turned and noticed the
outline of a smile on his face.
"Where??"
