# Campus Drivers Cautioned
## Tighter Parking Regs Put In Effect 
### 
Changes in enforcement of
parking regulations and several
new parking regulations become
effective Wednesday.
Vehicle registration with the
Stanford Police Dept. will be
optional for faculty, staff, and
off-campus students.
Last year these vehicles re
quired registration. Registered
vehicles, however, will receive
preferred parking privileges. On
campus students must register
their vehicles.
Unregistered vehicles violating
parking regulations will receive
Santa Clara County citations to
the Palo Alto-Mountain View
Municipal Court. Moving vio
lations will be handled in the same
manner.
Registered vehicles in violation
will receive University citations
requiring the registrant to pay the
fine within ten days or request an
appeal within five days.
Officer To Be Appointed
A parking appeals officer,
whose appointment will be an
nounced in the next few days, will
hear all appeals. Registration will
be revoked for faculty or staff
violators who do not pay the fine
or request an appeal, or who do
not pay the charge on a denied
appeal. The vehicle could then
park only in a general parking
area.
Student violators may not
register for any succeeding quarter

and transcripts will be withheld
until parking fines are paid. Their
vehicle registration will not be
revoked, however.
Rules of the road contained in
the California Vehicle Code
generally apply to Stanford and
the speed limit will be 25 m.p.h.
Regulations Enforced
Most common violations at
Stanford include parking in an
intersection; in a crosswalk; in
front of a driveway; on a side
walk; double parking; not parked
within 18 inches of the curb; and
parking within 15 feet of a fire
hydrant.
Violations of this type will be
enforced by Santa Clara County
Sheriff's deputies and five Stan
ford policemen with peace officer
status solely for enforcement of
parking regulations.
All violations of the vehicle
code will be enforced by Santa
Clara Co. Sheriff and violators
cited to Palo Alto-Mountain View
Municipal Court.
Motorcycles and motor
scooters may not be operated
within 100 feet of a classroom
building or parked within 100 feet
of a classroom building or parked
within 100 feet of classroom
buildings or dorms.
Order from Chaos
President Pitzer described the
new regulations as "filling an
urgent need to bring order to
what has been a chaotic parking

and traffic situation."
That the campus vehiclo pop
ulation has rcachcd crisis propor
tions was amply indicated in a
survey compiled by Oscar Nelson,
senior planner in the University s
Planning Office.
His figures show that whereas
in 1957-58, more than 75 per cent
of the campus population had cars

registered with the Police Depart
ment, figures for the 1968-69
academic year show that now
more than QO per cent have cars
registered.
Current registration shows that
17,744 vehicles were registered, of
which 367 were motorcycles.
Parking permits issued to faculty
and senior staff totaled 3476;

those to junior staff, teaching
assistants and research personnel
totaled 7668, and those to stu
dents 6600.
Of the students, 3043 re
quested permission for off-campus
parking areas and 3557 requested
on-campus parking.
Chairman of the faculty-staff
student parking committee which
will serve as a continuing advisory
group is Prof. John Brauman,
Chemistry; other faculty members
are Prof. Clarkson Oglesby of Civil
Engineering and Gayton E.
Germane of the Graduate School
of Business.
Staff members are Dan
DeYoung, Assistant Business
Manager; Assistant Dean of
Students Daniel Williams, and
Miss Jane Fajardo, administrative
aide in Aeronautics and Astro
nautics.
Students include John Grube,
of the Associated Student's
Council of Presidents, David Swift
and Fred Nold.
Prof. Brauman was also chair
man of a committee appointed in
October 1968 by Acting President
Robert Glaser, which pulled to
gether the original regulations.
Summaries of parking regula
tions, a parking map, and letter
from President Pitzer accompany
all registration stickers and also
can be obtained at the Stanford
police station.

Order from Chaos
President Pitzer described the

urgent need to bring order to
what has been a chaotic parking

and traffic situation."
That the campus vehiclo pop
ulation has rcachcd crisis propor
tions was amply indicated in a
survey compiled by Oscar Nelson,
senior planner in the University s
Planning Office.
His figures show that whereas
in 1957-58, more than 75 per cent
of the campus population had cars

registered with the Police Depart
ment, figures for the 1968-69
academic year show that now
more than QO per cent have cars

which 367 were motorcycles.
Parking permits issued to faculty
and senior staff totaled 3476;

those to junior staff, teaching

police station.
Changes in enforcement of
parking regulations and several
new parking regulations become
effective Wednesday.
Vehicle registration with the
