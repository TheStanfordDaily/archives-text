### 
Chaparral, a 70-year-old stu
dent magazine at Stanford,
appeared yesterday for the first
time in nine months in a new,
radical format.
The 2'l-page tabloid contained
feature articles, satire, essays and
a section on arts & entertainment.
Staff members -announced that
Chaparral will appear every other
Thursday. The next issue is
October 9.
Copies of the issue have been
distributed free throughout cam
pus, according to Chaparral staff.
A letters section will be added
to the next issue, according to
Michael Sweeney of Chaparral. He
said that all members of the
Stanford community, "especially

artists, professional journalists and
other fanatics," are welcome to
join the staff.
Chaparral was founded in 1899
as a "college comic." For most of
its existence. Chaparral appeared
as a monthly humor magazine. In
1967, the editors announced that
they were switching to a general
feature formal appearing quarter
ly. The magazine failed financially
soon afterwards.
Chaparral, unlike other student
publications at Stanford, is legally
independent from the ASSU or
any other group. The owner is the
Hammer & Coffin Society, an
unincorporated association found
ed in 1906 and reorganized as a
business trust in 1 937.
