# Easy Entertainment At Stanford
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
The word "entertainment" can
mean a hundred different things
to as many people. Doubtless,
some people can find and/or
create enough diversions solely
within the confines of their own
lives to satisfy extra-curricular,
extra-essential needs. Some may
prefer politics, football or getting
stoned. Others may be too busy
to simply "pass the time," or
would just rather kill it. Be this as
it may, this writer's activities are
dedicated to the proposition that
there is a preponderance of
individuals with an interest in the
popular arts.
An entertainment writer at
once faces an important decision:
will he act as a reviewer or as a
critic? Particularly apt, I think, is
Walter Kerr's maxim that the
difference between reviewing and
criticism is making the assumption
that the reader has not seen the
work discussed and assuming that
he has. As I must function as both
a reporter and a critic, some
articles will be of a basically
informative nature with
accompanying personal comments
(such as a weekly capsule survey
of campus films) while other
pieces will go into depth on
specific works, particularly in the
fields of film and drama.
All dogmatic miscellany aside,
there are always innumerable
entertainment opportunities both
on campus and in the Bay Area.
At Stanford, a minimum of nine
films are shown each week at
various series, with Clive Miller's
Tuesday night festival of old
American films and personal
favorites, the weekend showings
at Tresidder and the Sunday
Flicks usually being the most
crowded. A complete campus film
schedule will be published early
next week but as a preview, the
Friday night Tresidder series will
offer a chronological,
near-complete retrospective of the
work of director Jean-Luc
Godard, culminating with
screenings of his latest, most
controversial film, Weekend, while
on Saturdays, the Union will
present actors' and directors'
classics such as The Maltese
Falcon, Boudu Saved From
Drowning and Sunset Boulevard.
There are several easily
accessible cinemas in the Palo
Alto area and most pictures run
here concurrently with their San
Francisco engagements or open
soon afterwards. The Paris, the
Guild in Menlo Park and, from
time to time, the Los Altos are
the local art houses, but all the
theatres are worth watching for an
occasionally unusual double bill
or revival.
Theatrical activity abounds at
Stanford throughout the year.
This quarter, we will see the
return of the student-created
musical extravaganza, Gaities,
after a year's absence. The
Stanford Repertory Company will
stage O'Neill's The Iceman
Cometh and Shaw's Androcles
and (he Lion within the next
three months and will complete
the season with Shakespeare's The
Winter's Tale, Peter Ustinov's The
Unknown Soldier and His Wife,
Robert Ardrey's Shadow of
Heroes and the world premiere of
The Drums of Snow. Productions
can also be expected from the
undergraduate drama group, The
Company, as well as from other

experimental troupes and visiting
companies.
Of major interest to the
Stanford community is The
Illigitimate Theatre. Located just
east of El Camino Real on
University, this unusual
establishment offers a comic
improvisational revue amidst the
setting of an intimate nightclub

While San Francisco may seem
impregnable to those without cars
and impractical even to people
with wheels, the lure of what the
cit.y offers is often too much to
resist. San Francisco is second
only to New York in its cultural
dominion and what it lacks in
quantity is often compensated for
in freshness and daring and by the

Living in Paris has recently
opened after a brief engagement
at Stanford this summer, as has
Dames At Sea, a satire/nostalgia
piece set in the mythical era of
the 1930's musical. As a West
Coast edition of the off-Broadway
abomination, Geese, and an
uncalled for revival of Neil
Simon's Come Blow Your Horn
mark time at downtown theatres,
we can await the arrival of the
Grand Kabuki, a pre-Rroadway
engagement of Meredith Willson's
new musical, 1491 and, most
eagerly or most apprehensively,
the sexsational Oh! Calcutta! San
Francisco's erratic but sometimes
brilliant American Conservatory
Theatre is now in New York for a
brief stay but will soon return to
begin another active season. As a
footnote, You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown and The
Fantasticks are in their third and
fifth years respectively and The
Committee continues to amuse
with its currently excellent, if
overly brief, satiric revue.

brilliant American Conservatory

brief stay but will soon return to

The word "entertainment" can
mean a hundred different things
to as many people. Doubtless,
some people can find and/or
create enough diversions solely
within the confines of their own
lives to satisfy extra-curricular,
extra-essential needs. Some may
prefer politics, football or getting
stoned. Others may be too busy
to simply "pass the time," or
would just rather kill it. Be this as
it may, this writer's activities are
dedicated to the proposition that
there is a preponderance of
individuals with an interest in the
popular arts.
An entertainment writer at
once faces an important decision:
will he act as a reviewer or as a
critic? Particularly apt, I think, is
Walter Kerr's maxim that the
difference between reviewing and
criticism is making the assumption
that the reader has not seen the
work discussed and assuming that
he has. As I must function as both
a reporter and a critic, some
articles will be of a basically
informative nature with
accompanying personal comments
(such as a weekly capsule survey
of campus films) while other
pieces will go into depth on
specific works, particularly in the
fields of film and drama.
All dogmatic miscellany aside,
there are always innumerable
entertainment opportunities both
on campus and in the Bay Area.
At Stanford, a minimum of nine
films are shown each week at
various series, with Clive Miller's
Tuesday night festival of old
American films and personal
favorites, the weekend showings
at Tresidder and the Sunday
Flicks usually being the most
crowded. A complete campus film
schedule will be published early
next week but as a preview, the
Friday night Tresidder series will
offer a chronological,
near-complete retrospective of the
work of director Jean-Luc
Godard, culminating with
screenings of his latest, most
controversial film, Weekend, while
on Saturdays, the Union will
present actors' and directors'
classics such as The Maltese
Falcon, Boudu Saved From
Drowning and Sunset Boulevard.
There are several easily
accessible cinemas in the Palo
Alto area and most pictures run
here concurrently with their San
Francisco engagements or open
soon afterwards. The Paris, the
Guild in Menlo Park and, from
time to time, the Los Altos are
the local art houses, but all the
theatres are worth watching for an
occasionally unusual double bill
or revival.
Theatrical activity abounds at
Stanford throughout the year.
This quarter, we will see the
return of the student-created
musical extravaganza, Gaities,
after a year's absence. The
Stanford Repertory Company will
stage O'Neill's The Iceman
Cometh and Shaw's Androcles
and (he Lion within the next
three months and will complete
the season with Shakespeare's The
Winter's Tale, Peter Ustinov's The
Unknown Soldier and His Wife,
Robert Ardrey's Shadow of
Heroes and the world premiere of
The Drums of Snow. Productions
can also be expected from the
undergraduate drama group, The
Company, as well as from other

experimental troupes and visiting
companies.
Of major interest to the
Stanford community is The
Illigitimate Theatre. Located just
east of El Camino Real on
University, this unusual
establishment offers a comic
improvisational revue amidst the
setting of an intimate nightclub

While San Francisco may seem
impregnable to those without cars

Dames At Sea, a satire/nostalgia
piece set in the mythical era of
the 1930's musical. As a West
Coast edition of the off-Broadway
abomination, Geese, and an
uncalled for revival of Neil
Simon's Come Blow Your Horn
mark time at downtown theatres,
we can await the arrival of the
Grand Kabuki, a pre-Rroadway
engagement of Meredith Willson's
new musical, 1491 and, most
eagerly or most apprehensively,
the sexsational Oh! Calcutta! San
Francisco's erratic but sometimes
brilliant American Conservatory
Theatre is now in New York for a
brief stay but will soon return to
begin another active season. As a
footnote, You're a Good Man,
Charlie Brown and The
Fantasticks are in their third and
fifth years respectively and The
Committee continues to amuse
with its currently excellent, if
overly brief, satiric revue.
