# "The City"
## Culture Up North 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
While Stanford may at first
seem to offer enough activities,
programs and events to fill even
the most avid culture monger's
schedule, anyone who confines
himself exclusively to campus
"art" will be missing the many
opportunities offered by glorious
San Francisco.
Throughout the year, I'll be
writing about music and related
entertainments, especially what is
generally know as "classical"
music. An amazing amount of
great music, both live and
recorded, is available to you; with
a little effort, and surprisingly
little money. First and foremost is
the San Francisco Symphony.
Student tickets will be on sale
soon at incredibly low prices.
Josef Krips and Seiji Oaawa are
the principle conductors; Krips is
internationally known for his
interpretations of Beethoven
symphonies and concerti, and
Ozawa for his work on Stravinsky
and other contemporary
composers. The Symphony itself
occupies a leading position in the
extended midrange of American
symphonies, which is to say it is
good but not great. But attending
the Symphony is an enjoyable
experience, and the upcoming
season looks to be the best one is
many years.
This is the two hundredth
anniversary of Beethoven's birth,
and the Symphony is celebrating
in grand fashion. The master's
symphonies, all five piano
concerti, the violin concerto,
several overtures and the Missa
Solemnis will all be presented.
Ozawa will present an
all-Stravinsky evening, and the
season is shaping up as one of
well-known, always accepted
music. A safe but very worthwhile
set of programs, and season
tickets amount to a little over a
dollar per concert. The full season

of Wednesday evening
performances is twenty-two
concerts, and there is a choice of
either or both of two different
eleven concert series. For those
without cars, a chartered bus
leaves from the dorms and returns
after the concert.
The City also has an opera and
a ballet, but you'll be hearing
about them from Rick Atkins.
Corey Goodman will be covering
the rock scene, which is highly
active in San Francisco and even,
to a limited degree, in Palo Alto.
Everything else of a musical
nature will be found in this
column.
The most immediate
excitement around, and some of
the best you'll find all year,
occurs twice this weekend. All
day Saturday and Sunday in
Marin, north of San Francisco
about five miles, the Renaissance
Pleasure Faire offers the sixteenth
century with the music and dance,
artisans and artists, foodmongers
and wine merchants—a re-creation
of a Renaissance country fair.
Stall-keepers sell stained-glass
windows, amulets, sandaL, and
water-pipes; the food available
consists of mutton stew, roast
turkey, frt>h-baked bread, lentil
soup, with wine and mead to
drink. But the best thing about
the Faire is that the participants
and many visitors come dressed in
Renaissance costumes—flowing
gowns, rustic tunics, leather boots
and sandals, feathered caps. When
you go, you need not dress in that

style, but you are welcome to
(and you'll enjoy it nore if you
do). Stay all day, watch the
folk-dancers, the musicians and
the singers, the marionette shows,
and live a different life for a day.
As the Faire has been going on
each weekend in September, the
last two days may be busy. Leave
early, drive up Bayshore to the
City, go across the Golden Gate
(free going north, four bits
coming back), and get off 101 at
the Marin Civic Center; then just
follow the signs and the cars. If
you have time, drop into the
MCC, Frank Lloyd Wright's
creation.
So here you are. You're about
to pay some incredible sum for
tuition, room and board, you're
apprehensive about The Future,
someone told you the whole place
is about to tip over the Edge of
Greatness, and I'm telling you to
chuck it all and split for Marin.
And that's just for starters.

gowns, rustic tunics, leather boots
and sandals, feathered caps. When
you go, you need not dress in that

style, but you are welcome to
(and you'll enjoy it nore if you
do). Stay all day, watch the
folk-dancers, the musicians and
the singers, the marionette shows,
and live a different life for a day.
As the Faire has been going on
each weekend in September, the
last two days may be busy. Leave
early, drive up Bayshore to the
City, go across the Golden Gate
(free going north, four bits
coming back), and get off 101 at
the Marin Civic Center; then just
follow the signs and the cars. If
you have time, drop into the
MCC, Frank Lloyd Wright's
creation.
So here you are. You're about
to pay some incredible sum for
tuition, room and board, you're
apprehensive about The Future,
someone told you the whole place
is about to tip over the Edge of
Greatness, and I'm telling you to
chuck it all and split for Marin.
And that's just for starters.
While Stanford may at first
seem to offer enough activities,
programs and events to fill even
the most avid culture monger's
schedule, anyone who confines
himself exclusively to campus
"art" will be missing the many
opportunities offered by glorious
San Francisco.
Throughout the year, I'll be
writing about music and related
entertainments, especially what is
generally know as "classical"
music. An amazing amount of
great music, both live and
recorded, is available to you; with
a little effort, and surprisingly
little money. First and foremost is
the San Francisco Symphony.
Student tickets will be on sale
soon at incredibly low prices.
Josef Krips and Seiji Oaawa are
the principle conductors; Krips is
internationally known for his
interpretations of Beethoven
symphonies and concerti, and
Ozawa for his work on Stravinsky
and other contemporary
composers. The Symphony itself
occupies a leading position in the
extended midrange of American
symphonies, which is to say it is
good but not great. But attending
the Symphony is an enjoyable
experience, and the upcoming
season looks to be the best one is
many years.
This is the two hundredth
anniversary of Beethoven's birth,
and the Symphony is celebrating
in grand fashion. The master's
symphonies, all five piano
concerti, the violin concerto,
several overtures and the Missa
Solemnis will all be presented.
Ozawa will present an
all-Stravinsky evening, and the
season is shaping up as one of
well-known, always accepted
music. A safe but very worthwhile
set of programs, and season
tickets amount to a little over a
dollar per concert. The full season

of Wednesday evening
performances is twenty-two
concerts, and there is a choice of
either or both of two different
eleven concert series. For those
without cars, a chartered bus
leaves from the dorms and returns
after the concert.
The City also has an opera and
a ballet, but you'll be hearing
about them from Rick Atkins.
Corey Goodman will be covering
the rock scene, which is highly
active in San Francisco and even,
to a limited degree, in Palo Alto.
Everything else of a musical
nature will be found in this
column.
The most immediate
excitement around, and some of
the best you'll find all year,
occurs twice this weekend. All
day Saturday and Sunday in
Marin, north of San Francisco
about five miles, the Renaissance
Pleasure Faire offers the sixteenth
century with the music and dance,
artisans and artists, foodmongers
and wine merchants—a re-creation
of a Renaissance country fair.
Stall-keepers sell stained-glass
windows, amulets, sandaL, and
water-pipes; the food available
consists of mutton stew, roast
turkey, frt>h-baked bread, lentil
soup, with wine and mead to
drink. But the best thing about
the Faire is that the participants
and many visitors come dressed in
Renaissance costumes—flowing
gowns, rustic tunics, leather boots
and sandals, feathered caps. When
you go, you need not dress in that

style, but you are welcome to
(and you'll enjoy it nore if you
do). Stay all day, watch the
