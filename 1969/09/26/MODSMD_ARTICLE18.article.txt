# Minority Enrollment Increases
## 
### ROBERT MICHELET 
A drive by Stanford to recruit
more minority group students has
resulted in a large increase in the
number of black and Chicano
(Mexican-American) students on
campus.
A campaign involving both
administration officials and
students has brought a record
number of minority students to
Stanford, most of them in the
freshman Class of 1973.
Two men headed up drives last
year to bring more minority
students to Stanford this fall. Luis
Nogales, working with MECHA,
the Chicano student organization

on campus, and Tom Rhue,
working part-time, spearheaded
efforts to recruit the students.
Fifteen Chicano students aided
Nogales by traveling to high
schools in California, Arizona,
New Mexico, Colorado and Texas.
As a result, the Chicano
population of Stanford will rise
from 57 last year to nearly 200,
including almost 70 freshmen, 20
transfers and 30 to 40 graduate
students.
Rhue, because of his part-time
status, had a very small program
and traveled only in California,
but the results were encouraging.
The number of black applicants
doubled to 300 and 112 were
admitted, a larger number than
ever before. 63 freshmen are
among the nearly 300 black
students now at Stanford.
The totals are dramatically
higher than those of just a few
years ago. There were only 88
blacks admitted last year, and
three years ago there were only
three Chicanos in the entering
freshman class.
Standards Not Lowered
Nogales and Rhue both
stressed that admission standards
were not lowered to accept the

minority students. "We did not
apply lower standards, but did use
a different criteria," Nogales said.
He explained that these different
criteria included examination of
the family income. In many
Chicano families, the children are
forced to work to help support
the home. Because of this, the
student is unable to participate in
high school extra-curricular
activities which would improve his
chances of acceptance.
A chicano student has another
large disadvantage in that Spanish
is his first language and he has to
then learn English.
Nogales explained that these
students still have the potential to
succeed in college, although their
high school records differ from
those of students normally
accepted to Stanford. "Other
human characteristics will help
bridge the gap," he said.
"Credibility Gap"
He also outlined a "credibility
gap" that exists between the
Chicano community and an
institution like Stanford. He says
the Chicanos ask two questions:
"Is Stanford interested in bringing
Chicanos to Stanford? If yes,
why?" Nogales' answer to the first

question is yes, that there are
many individuals—administration,
faculty and students that are
interested in bringing in more
Chicano students. "Not everyone,
but some—enough to make a
difference."
And why? "Because they
realize that certain people have
been banned from the school," he
says. Nogales also claims that by
admitting more minority students,
the alienation that exists between
the groups and society can be
eased
Both agree that the results of
increased numbers of minority
students will be good. Rhue says
that an increased black population
will help the blacks already here
"develop a sensitivity for
themselves," and give them more
of an identity. Nogales claims
"the Chicano students can bring a
different perspective. It is
important for Stanford students
to be exposed to minority
students." But the situation is also
"a two-way street. It makes for
mutual understanding."
Financial aid is an important
factor in the recruiting of
minority students. Since the
homes of minority students are
* :
Diversity is the key for this
year's entering freshman class.
The old reputation that to
become a student at Stanford one
had to be his high school's student
body president or a varsity
athelete is no longer true. What
other university has a freshman
who has derived an equation for
the "pointiness" of a pencil, one
who contracted to paint 110,000
tricycle wheels, or who ran belly
button contests?
Freshman ingenuity has
extended to a study of
"geometrical and mathematical
efficiency of bees in the
construction of their
honeycombs." One freshman
sponsored a balsa bridge building
contest, and another was
politically involved to the extent
of being the president of the
president's council of presidents!
Minority Increases
Out of 9345 applicants came
this freshman class of 1410
individuals. Of this number, 955
are males and 455 are females.
The admissions department has
continued to increase the number
of minority students entering
Stanford. This year the freshmen

less able to provide funds than
those of white students,
additional aid is required to bring
them to Stanford. Nogales
explained, however, that by
accepting more minority students,
new sources are becoming
available. "In order to support
them, we are tapping previously
unavailable sources. There are
Educational Opportunity Grants,
Cal State scholarships, foundation
money, even private money
available."
Rhue says that the amount of
financial aid available has put a
quota on the number of minority
students that can be accepted. As
soon as the money for student aid
runs out, they cannot admit any
more students.
Rhue, who would like to see a
10 per cent black population
minimum at Stanford, feels the
increase in the number of black
students is meant to bring about
more self-determination by blacks
of their lives.
Both say response by minority
students has been very
enthusiastic, although, as Nogales
says, "Stanford had to do a selling
job to overcome the problems of
its credibility gap."
c *
class includes 63 black students
and 70 Mexican-American
students, four and five percent of
the class respectively. This
represents the largest percentage
of minority enrollment in
Stanford history.
The freshmen come from all
over the United States, with 19
percent from east of the
Mississippi and 81 percent from
west of the Mississippi.
California draws the most
entering students, this year having
48 percent of the class. Following
California, are Washington,
Oregon, Texas, Colorado, New
York and Illinois heading the list
of home states. Two percent of
the class of '72 come to Stanford
from foreign countries.
This year's freshmen seem to
have no lack of academic ability
with nine Presidential Scholars,
eight Sloan Scholars, and 70
National Merit Scholars.
Another increase over the last
few years is in financial aid to
students. This year 48 percent of
the freshman class will be
receiving aid as contrasted to an
average of approximately 40
percent over the last five years.

individuals. Of this number, 955
are males and 455 are females.
The admissions department has
continued to increase the number
of minority students entering
Stanford. This year the freshmen

less able to provide funds than
those of white students,
additional aid is required to bring
them to Stanford. Nogales
explained, however, that by
accepting more minority students,
new sources are becoming
available. "In order to support
them, we are tapping previously
unavailable sources. There are
Educational Opportunity Grants,
Cal State scholarships, foundation
money, even private money
available."
Rhue says that the amount of
financial aid available has put a
quota on the number of minority
students that can be accepted. As
soon as the money for student aid
runs out, they cannot admit any
more students.
Rhue, who would like to see a
10 per cent black population
minimum at Stanford, feels the
increase in the number of black
students is meant to bring about
more self-determination by blacks
of their lives.
Both say response by minority
students has been very
enthusiastic, although, as Nogales
says, "Stanford had to do a selling
job to overcome the problems of
its credibility gap."
c *
class includes 63 black students
and 70 Mexican-American
students, four and five percent of
the class respectively. This
represents the largest percentage
of minority enrollment in
Stanford history.
The freshmen come from all
over the United States, with 19
percent from east of the
Mississippi and 81 percent from
west of the Mississippi.
California draws the most
entering students, this year having
48 percent of the class. Following
California, are Washington,
Oregon, Texas, Colorado, New
York and Illinois heading the list
of home states. Two percent of
the class of '72 come to Stanford
from foreign countries.
This year's freshmen seem to
have no lack of academic ability
with nine Presidential Scholars,
eight Sloan Scholars, and 70
National Merit Scholars.
Another increase over the last
few years is in financial aid to
students. This year 48 percent of
the freshman class will be
receiving aid as contrasted to an
average of approximately 40
percent over the last five years.
A drive by Stanford to recruit
more minority group students has
resulted in a large increase in the
number of black and Chicano
(Mexican-American) students on
campus.
A campaign involving both
administration officials and
students has brought a record
number of minority students to
Stanford, most of them in the
freshman Class of 1973.
Two men headed up drives last
year to bring more minority
students to Stanford this fall. Luis
Nogales, working with MECHA,
the Chicano student organization

on campus, and Tom Rhue,
working part-time, spearheaded
efforts to recruit the students.
Fifteen Chicano students aided
Nogales by traveling to high
schools in California, Arizona,
New Mexico, Colorado and Texas.
As a result, the Chicano
population of Stanford will rise
from 57 last year to nearly 200,
including almost 70 freshmen, 20
transfers and 30 to 40 graduate
students.
Rhue, because of his part-time
status, had a very small program
and traveled only in California,
but the results were encouraging.
The number of black applicants
doubled to 300 and 112 were
admitted, a larger number than
ever before. 63 freshmen are
among the nearly 300 black
students now at Stanford.
The totals are dramatically
higher than those of just a few
years ago. There were only 88
blacks admitted last year, and
three years ago there were only
three Chicanos in the entering
freshman class.
Standards Not Lowered
Nogales and Rhue both
stressed that admission standards
were not lowered to accept the

minority students. "We did not
apply lower standards, but did use
a different criteria," Nogales said.
He explained that these different
criteria included examination of
the family income. In many
Chicano families, the children are
forced to work to help support
the home. Because of this, the
student is unable to participate in
high school extra-curricular
activities which would improve his
chances of acceptance.
A chicano student has another
large disadvantage in that Spanish
is his first language and he has to
then learn English.
Nogales explained that these
students still have the potential to
succeed in college, although their
high school records differ from
those of students normally
accepted to Stanford. "Other
human characteristics will help
bridge the gap," he said.
"Credibility Gap"
He also outlined a "credibility
gap" that exists between the
Chicano community and an
institution like Stanford. He says
the Chicanos ask two questions:
"Is Stanford interested in bringing
Chicanos to Stanford? If yes,
why?" Nogales' answer to the first

question is yes, that there are
many individuals—administration,
faculty and students that are
interested in bringing in more
Chicano students. "Not everyone,
but some—enough to make a
difference."
And why? "Because they
realize that certain people have
been banned from the school," he
says. Nogales also claims that by
admitting more minority students,
the alienation that exists between
the groups and society can be
eased
Both agree that the results of
increased numbers of minority
students will be good. Rhue says
that an increased black population
will help the blacks already here
"develop a sensitivity for
themselves," and give them more
of an identity. Nogales claims
"the Chicano students can bring a
different perspective. It is
important for Stanford students
to be exposed to minority
students." But the situation is also
"a two-way street. It makes for
mutual understanding."
Financial aid is an important
factor in the recruiting of
minority students. Since the
homes of minority students are
* :
Diversity is the key for this
year's entering freshman class.
The old reputation that to
become a student at Stanford one
had to be his high school's student
body president or a varsity
athelete is no longer true. What
other university has a freshman
who has derived an equation for
the "pointiness" of a pencil, one
who contracted to paint 110,000
tricycle wheels, or who ran belly
button contests?
Freshman ingenuity has
extended to a study of
"geometrical and mathematical
efficiency of bees in the
construction of their
honeycombs." One freshman
sponsored a balsa bridge building
contest, and another was
politically involved to the extent
of being the president of the
president's council of presidents!

high school records differ from
those of students normally
accepted to Stanford. "Other
human characteristics will help
bridge the gap," he said.
"Credibility Gap"
He also outlined a "credibility
gap" that exists between the
Chicano community and an
institution like Stanford. He says
the Chicanos ask two questions:
"Is Stanford interested in bringing
Chicanos to Stanford? If yes,
why?" Nogales' answer to the first

question is yes, that there are
many individuals—administration,
faculty and students that are
interested in bringing in more
Chicano students. "Not everyone,
but some—enough to make a
difference."
And why? "Because they
realize that certain people have
been banned from the school," he
says. Nogales also claims that by
admitting more minority students,
the alienation that exists between
the groups and society can be
eased
Both agree that the results of
increased numbers of minority
students will be good. Rhue says
that an increased black population
will help the blacks already here
"develop a sensitivity for
themselves," and give them more
of an identity. Nogales claims
"the Chicano students can bring a
different perspective. It is
important for Stanford students
to be exposed to minority
students." But the situation is also
"a two-way street. It makes for
mutual understanding."
Financial aid is an important
factor in the recruiting of
minority students. Since the

Diversity is the key for this

The old reputation that to
become a student at Stanford one
had to be his high school's student
body president or a varsity
athelete is no longer true. What
other university has a freshman
who has derived an equation for
the "pointiness" of a pencil, one
who contracted to paint 110,000
tricycle wheels, or who ran belly
button contests?
Freshman ingenuity has
extended to a study of
"geometrical and mathematical
efficiency of bees in the

sponsored a balsa bridge building
contest, and another was

president's council of presidents!
Minority Increases
Out of 9345 applicants came
this freshman class of 1410
individuals. Of this number, 955
are males and 455 are females.
The admissions department has
continued to increase the number
of minority students entering
Stanford. This year the freshmen

less able to provide funds than
those of white students,
additional aid is required to bring
them to Stanford. Nogales
explained, however, that by
accepting more minority students,
new sources are becoming
available. "In order to support
them, we are tapping previously
unavailable sources. There are
Educational Opportunity Grants,
Cal State scholarships, foundation
money, even private money
available."
Rhue says that the amount of
financial aid available has put a
quota on the number of minority
students that can be accepted. As
soon as the money for student aid
runs out, they cannot admit any
more students.
Rhue, who would like to see a
10 per cent black population
minimum at Stanford, feels the
increase in the number of black
students is meant to bring about
more self-determination by blacks
of their lives.
Both say response by minority
students has been very
enthusiastic, although, as Nogales
says, "Stanford had to do a selling
job to overcome the problems of
its credibility gap."
c *
class includes 63 black students
and 70 Mexican-American
students, four and five percent of
the class respectively. This
represents the largest percentage
of minority enrollment in
Stanford history.
The freshmen come from all
over the United States, with 19
percent from east of the
Mississippi and 81 percent from
west of the Mississippi.
California draws the most
entering students, this year having
48 percent of the class. Following
California, are Washington,
Oregon, Texas, Colorado, New
York and Illinois heading the list
of home states. Two percent of
the class of '72 come to Stanford
from foreign countries.
This year's freshmen seem to
have no lack of academic ability
with nine Presidential Scholars,
eight Sloan Scholars, and 70
National Merit Scholars.
Another increase over the last
few years is in financial aid to
students. This year 48 percent of
the freshman class will be
receiving aid as contrasted to an
average of approximately 40
percent over the last five years.
A drive by Stanford to recruit
more minority group students has
resulted in a large increase in the
number of black and Chicano
(Mexican-American) students on
campus.
A campaign involving both
administration officials and
students has brought a record
number of minority students to
Stanford, most of them in the
freshman Class of 1973.
Two men headed up drives last
year to bring more minority
students to Stanford this fall. Luis
Nogales, working with MECHA,
the Chicano student organization

on campus, and Tom Rhue,
working part-time, spearheaded
efforts to recruit the students.
Fifteen Chicano students aided
Nogales by traveling to high
schools in California, Arizona,
New Mexico, Colorado and Texas.
As a result, the Chicano
population of Stanford will rise
from 57 last year to nearly 200,
including almost 70 freshmen, 20
transfers and 30 to 40 graduate
students.
Rhue, because of his part-time
status, had a very small program
and traveled only in California,
but the results were encouraging.
The number of black applicants
doubled to 300 and 112 were
admitted, a larger number than
ever before. 63 freshmen are
among the nearly 300 black
students now at Stanford.
The totals are dramatically
higher than those of just a few
years ago. There were only 88
blacks admitted last year, and
three years ago there were only
three Chicanos in the entering
freshman class.
Standards Not Lowered
Nogales and Rhue both
stressed that admission standards
were not lowered to accept the

minority students. "We did not
apply lower standards, but did use
a different criteria," Nogales said.
He explained that these different
criteria included examination of
the family income. In many
Chicano families, the children are
forced to work to help support
the home. Because of this, the
student is unable to participate in
high school extra-curricular
activities which would improve his
chances of acceptance.
A chicano student has another
large disadvantage in that Spanish
is his first language and he has to
then learn English.
Nogales explained that these
students still have the potential to
succeed in college, although their
high school records differ from
those of students normally
accepted to Stanford. "Other
