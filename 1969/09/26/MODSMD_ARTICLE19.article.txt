# Vague Status
## Sponsors Under Fire 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Fifty-three upperclassmen
chosen last spring by the Sponsor
Selection Committee are living in
freshman residences. Fifty are
officially designated university
sponsors. The other three are not.
The three students—Barbara
Hyland, Barbara Lee, and Geoff
White—were found guilty of dis
ruptive activities in the occu
pation of Encina Hall on May 1
last year, and placed on probation
in early June. Their limbo situa
tion represents a compromise: the
students will live in freshmen
dorms but will get no official title
or salary from the university.
The compromise is looked
upon by many administration
members as correcting an instance
of university overreaction. It was
worked out among various univer
sity constituencies in a situation
of ambiguous authority.
A memo dated May 14 (after
the Encina sit-in, but before the
students were found guilty) from
Associate Dean of Students Sally
Mahoney to Eric Larson, Chair
man of the Sponsor Selection
Committee, indicated that proba
tion would not interfere with

sponsor appointments. In part,
the memo read, "a sponsor may
continue to hold his residence
staff position provided that he
complies with the terms of his
probation." President Kenneth
Pitzer considered the memo to
effect, only "students on proba
tion at that time."
Defining Probation
No consensus on the definition
of "probation" existed. The Stu
dent Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) is charged with defining
the terms of penalties, but had
not clarified the meaning of
"probation." Special Assistant to
the President Willard Wyman
explains that, "In SCLC's failure
to establish a definition, it was
done administratively."
Pitzer consulted the Chairman
of SJC, professor Jack Frieden
thal, as to the SJC's intention in
its recommendations. "I talked
with Professor Friedenthal,"
Pitzer says,"and asked him
whether he thought it would be
feasible to get a definition of
'probation'. He thought it im
practical to get the Council
together but advised me so as to
avoid a conflict with SJC's inten
tions."
Dick Lee, a student member of
the SJC last spring, denies, how
ever, that Pitzer's decision ac
curately reflected the ideas of the
SJC. "Pitzer stretched even the
recommendations the Council did
send to him (regarding the Encina
case)," says Lee, "by defining the
word 'probation' in such a way
that the penalties the Council
recommended were in several
cases made more severe than the
Council had intended."
Pitzer's decision was announced
in a letter sent to convicted
defendants on June 16 by Wyman
on the President's behalf. It stated
that students already on proba
tion found guilty of another
violation of university rules would
be suspended. This statement was
later revised so that suspension
was no longer automatic.
The Pitzer decision also in
cluded the statement that stu
dents on probation may not hold
a "university position of trust and
responsibility." This is the state
ment which affected the appoint
ment of sponsors.
Critics of the decision charge

that Pitzer was using his admin
istrative power to carry out a
judicial matter. Pitzer, however,
denies that this is so. "Appoint
ments to positions that receive
university funds are an executive
matter, not a judicial one," he
says. "Official university des
ignates are under the ultimate
responsibility of the President and
his officers."
Another related criticism of
Pitzer's decision is that the
administration is interferriiig in
the selection of sponsors. Barbara
Lee, one of the three involved,
believes that Pitzer saw that "the
type of students becoming
sponsors are more controversial."
Barbara Hyland adds, "it was an
attempt to pacify alumni and
others who want to crack down
on us."
Reaching a Compromise
During the siiiiuner, Dean of
Students Peter Bulkeley negoti
ated with H«iad Sponsors Caroline
Bixby and Roger Boesche to
determine exactly what the
decision will mean. Boesche com
pliments Bulkeley for "doing an
excellent job of trying to under
stand the student side."
The Sponsor Selection Commit
tee, composed of 6 sponsors,
three freshmen, and three resi
dence directors, had chosen
Hyland, Lee and White to serve as
sponsors, and the three had
control on university housing.
Every effort was made to work
out an equitable solution.
The compromise that was
reached permits the three to live
in freshmen dorms without the
official title of sponsor, and
without receiving university
funds. (There is a precedent for
allowing upperclassmen to live in
freshmen dorms—The Daily
knows of two such cases last
year.)
The funds which were to have
been distributed among the 53
sponsors was divided among the
remaining 50. However, many
sponsors have decided to volun
tarily contribute, as Boesche ex
plains, "so that Barbara, Barbara,
and Geoff will be getting as much
as we are."
The three believe they are de
facto sponsors, if not officially
recognized by the university.
The Future
Bulkeley hopes to reestablish
the Student Services Committee.
Students will participate signifi
cantly, he says, and "one of their
specific responsibilities will be to
furnish a policy for the residence
system —including review of the
entire problem of the residence
staff."
Pitzer would also like to see
changes made in the sponsor
selection system. He says,"I think
the selection of sponsors should
be more of a university-wide
community affair —including
faculty and administration. These
people are carrying a university
designation, and all parts of the
university should be represented."
Boesche warns, however, that
"sponsors won't ever be admin
istrators." He fears that if Pitzer
tries to get more administrative
input into sponsor selection, "he
will destroy the sponsor pro
gram which is a vital part of the
residence system."
