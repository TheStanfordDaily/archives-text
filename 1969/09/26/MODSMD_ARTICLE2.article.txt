# Diversity A Theme
## Frosh Voice Views 
### MARION JOHNSTON 
Laden down with stereos and
amps, confusion and anticipation,
the freshmen arrived on campus
Wednesday. Whether propelled
here by parental advice, big school
reputation, or fear of the draft,
they are excited about the pos
sibilities before them for the next
four years.
Many expectations are about
meeting people, and as they were
greeted by sponsors, roommates,
and, for the girls, yellow-shirted
SAE's, freshmen appeared over
whelmed by all the attention.
"People are so friendly," says
Merritt Alden. "They'll see my
name tag and say 'hi'."
"I want to meet people,"
explained Chris Burke, and he was
echoed by Bonnie Barnes, and
many more. Mike Lipson elabor
ated, "I don't want to lose out on
the opportunity to meet anyone,
but I know I have my prejudices,
and I want to meet free type
people—aware."
New Opportunities
Stanford offers not only new
people but also new opportunities
to the freshmen. Many are unsure
of what they want, but know that
they want to try out as many
different things as possible. As
Chris Nordeen says,"I want to
look around, take a little of
everything."
Those (and there are many)
who are undecided about major
interests were drawn to Stanford
because, as John Johnston ex

plains, "Stanford has a decent
program in about everything, and
I'm undecided."
The relaxed requirements in
courses are also attractive to
freshmen. "Other places had end
less programs," says Richard
Cordtz "and I wanted to be able
to take what I wanted."
For most freshmen, continuing
on to college was the only path
they ever considered, but some of
the boys admit that if it hadn't
been for the draft, they might be
elsewhere this fall. "The draft had
a lot to do with me being here,"
says Dave Horgan. Mike Lipson
adds, "If it weren't for the draft, I
don't know if I'd be in college; I'd
love to just hitchhike around for
awhile."
Demonstrations
Most students arrive with some
knowledge and opinion on the
demonstrations which occurred at
Stanford last year. Some, like Dan
Bowers, feel "The administration
handled it very well."
Many are still curious and feel
they must find out more. "I want
to learn about the SDS," says
Tom Muirhead. Charlie Spaeth
offers, "I want to see for myself,
but I think violence is necessary in
some cases."
Parents seem to be more
apprehensive. Chris Nordeen's
mother, a Cal graduate, wouldn't
let her daughter go to Berkeley.
"If kids feel strongly about
something, it's all right to let
people know,"says Mrs. Nordeen,
"but I'm opposed to violence. It

should be within the law."
But not all freshmen thinking is
political. Quite a few still get
excited about sports—especially
football. "I want to see Jim
Plunkett," says Tom Muirhead.
And Theresa Ramirez hopes "to
go to all the football games."
Other interests range from drama
to music to tennis.
In fact, about the most one can
say about the freshmen is that
they are an assortment of individ
uals, waiting to see what Stanford
has to offer.
