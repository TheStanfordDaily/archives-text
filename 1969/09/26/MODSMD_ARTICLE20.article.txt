Pierre Cardin is breaking
another fashion precedent. After
having revolutionized concepts of
what the well-dressed man should
wear, he is about to show the
world how the man-in-the-know
should travel.
The interior of the car is
entirely decorated in synthetic
leather. The seats take the form of
pouffy Moroccan cushions. The
dashboard will sparkle with flash
ing green, white and red lights.
Instead of a conventional steering
wheel, spectators will see a re
duced wheel of about 8 inch
diameter encircling an enormous
mod watch. Available exterior
colors remain top-secret, but are
reputedly special inventions of
Cardin himself. Wherever chrome
trim would adorn a conventional
car, rubber bumpers grace the
Cardin model. With thorough
padding in the interior, the vehicle
is considered quite safe. Accord
ing to Simca, the lines of the
automobile are "sober, simple,
and terribly sophisticated."
