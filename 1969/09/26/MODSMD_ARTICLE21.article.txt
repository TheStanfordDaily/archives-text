# Printing Facilities Open To Students
## 
### 
The ASSU has set up a new
non-profit typesetting facility that
will allow student organizations to
publish newspapers, booklets and
pamphlets at a greatly reduced
cost.
The shop uses modern IBM
equipment to set type for photo
offset printing. Paste-up composi
tion is also provided. The shop
does not have a printing press, but
it will help student organizations
arrange for printing.
The shop is now in operation at
the Storke Student Publications
Building on Lomita Drive. Among
the publications being handled by

the shop on a regular basis are The
Stanford Daily, Stanford Chapar
ral and the Black Student Union's
The Colonist. The facility will do
work for any student organiza
tion, as time permits.
Information and rates may be
obtained from Tom Dawson,
Publications Board chairman,
whose office is in the Storke
Student Publications Building at
321-2300, extension 4631.
Supervisor for the printing shop
is Mrs. Beverly Hendricks, work
ing with Chris Stoneking, Pat
Alsop and several part-time stu
dent assistants.
