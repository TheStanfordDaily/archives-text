# Academic Senate Eases Regulations
## 
### 
B
The Academic Senate, in its
late summer and early fall ses
sions, has radically simplified
academic requirements for gradua
tion.
The Senate also created the
new administrative position of
Dean of Undergraduate Studies to
head the newly formed Commit
tee on Undergraduate Studies.
Both actions were designed to
create a new focus on undergrad
uate education.
In abolishing the "General
Studies Requirements," the
Senate provided simply that the
student must complete a two
quarter course in written composi
tion and take a total of three
quarters' work in each of three
areas: 1) humanities and the fine
arts; 2) social sciences; and 3)
mathematics, natural sciences, and
technology.
New Writing Requirements
Not all students will be re
quired to take composition
courses offered by the English
department. The requireemnt will
be waived for freshmen who 1)
pass a writing test in the Fall
quarter; 2) take one quarter of the
course and obtain a favorable
recommendation from their ad
visors; or 3) take two quarters of
any course approved by the newly
established Subcommittee on
Writing of the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
The Senate action drops foreign
language and the History of
Western Civilization as require
ments. Still, students are "strong
ly advised" to take a language
other than English; further cur
ricular guidelines may "recom
mend" that students elect to take
at least one history course.

Action Not Final
Since more than fifty pro
fessors have petitioned that the
Academic Council review the
Senate decision on the language
requirement, the decision is not
yet final.
In its other major action the
Senate abolished the Undergrad
uate Education and General
Studies Committees. In their place
it substituted the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
The Senate resolution specif
ically charges the dean with the
responsibility of "supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
the renovation of what is inad
equate, stimulating and assisting
educational innovation." A search
committee is now being formed to
nominate the dean.
In adopting the new require
ments and reorganizing the under
graduate education committees,
the Senate was acting on the
recommendations developed over
the last three years by the over
200 faculty, staff, and students
involved in the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES).

Action Not Final
Since more than fifty pro
fessors have petitioned that the
Academic Council review the
Senate decision on the language
requirement, the decision is not
yet final.
In its other major action the
Senate abolished the Undergrad
uate Education and General
Studies Committees. In their place
it substituted the Committee on
Undergraduate Studies.
The Senate resolution specif
ically charges the dean with the
responsibility of "supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
the renovation of what is inad
equate, stimulating and assisting
educational innovation." A search
committee is now being formed to
nominate the dean.
In adopting the new require
ments and reorganizing the under
graduate education committees,
the Senate was acting on the
recommendations developed over
the last three years by the over
200 faculty, staff, and students
involved in the Study of Educa
tion at Stanford (SES).
