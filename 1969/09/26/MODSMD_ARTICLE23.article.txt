# Next To Branner
## â€˜Out-Of-Style' Trailers Open 
### JULIE FLEECE 
A long-standing Stanford
tradition has been broken this fall,
as 468 undergraduates move into
on-campus housing without red
tile roofs. Manzanita Park, a
trailer community constructed
during the summer, is a maze of
light green buildings with white
aluminum roofs next to Branner
Hall.
The total cost of the project
has been estimated at $1,350,000,
which the Trustees authorized for
the project from site preparation
to landscaping. The construction
crew worked throughout the
summer to complete the mobile
home units, and the residents
began moving in Wednesday.

There are still several small
maintenance jobs to be
completed, but the trailers are
ready for occupancy.
The 117 trailer units provide
housing for 468 undergraduates
who would otherwise have been
forced to move off-campus. They
are expected to be in use until
1974 to ease Stanford's housing
crisis.
Each trailer unit houses four
people and has two single
bedrooms, a double bedroom, a
bath and a shower, a large
living-dining area, and a kitchen.
The units are arranged in clusters
of four around small courtyards.
Trailers Praised
The general reaction to the

trailers seems good. F.E.
Gallagher, director of Esrondido
Village and Manzanita Park, said
they have received mostly praise
so far. Few people even thought
they could be completed in time
for the start of fall quarter.
One resident described the
trailers as "off-campus living on
the campus, which you can't find
anywhere else". The rent is $205
a quarter, which is about $68 a
month.
The interiors of the trailers are
furnished, and one student
described the decor as "fantastic".
Residents have to buy their
own linens, kitchenware, and
tableware. A list distributed at the
Manzanita Park office estimates

the cost of linens at $25.20 per
person and of dishes and silver at
$7.00. A complete kitchenware
set is estimated at $40, which
would be $10 a person. Many
residents will spend much less
after bringing linens or
kitchenware from home.
Problems Voiced
The main complaints have been
that there are only three desks for
the four people in each unit and
that the inside walls are very thin.
There is also little closet space,
especially in the double bedroom.
Gallagher explained that in the
original blueprint, there was a
larger wardrobe closet in the
double bedroom but that it was
taken out to make the room larger
instead. There is no central
storage space for park residents.
The somewhat barren exterior
of the mobile homes is another
concern to many residents. At
present, painting the walls is
against regulations. The
administration is concerned about
it, however, and would consider

any feasible plan to improve
Manzanita.
The park is also quite dark at
night. As more residents move in,
there will probably be more light
from the homes themselves. A
survey will be conducted soon to
determine whether more lighting
at night is necessary.
Another problem one resident
mentioned is that there are no
washing machines yet. A
"community building" is being
built that will have laundry
facilities, a large meeting room,
and a director's office. This
building will be completed in
mid-October. Until then,
Manzanita residents may use the
laundry room in he basement of
McFarland House, Escondido
Village.
A landscaped area in the center
of the park will also be finished
by mid-October, or possibly
earlier. The area will be a grassy
field suitable for volleyball and
other recreation.

Gallagher explained that in the
original blueprint, there was a
larger wardrobe closet in the
double bedroom but that it was
taken out to make the room larger
instead. There is no central
storage space for park residents.
The somewhat barren exterior
of the mobile homes is another
concern to many residents. At
present, painting the walls is
against regulations. The
administration is concerned about
it, however, and would consider

any feasible plan to improve
Manzanita.
The park is also quite dark at
night. As more residents move in,
there will probably be more light
from the homes themselves. A
survey will be conducted soon to
determine whether more lighting
at night is necessary.
Another problem one resident
mentioned is that there are no
washing machines yet. A
"community building" is being
built that will have laundry
facilities, a large meeting room,
and a director's office. This
building will be completed in
mid-October. Until then,
Manzanita residents may use the
laundry room in he basement of
McFarland House, Escondido
Village.
A landscaped area in the center
of the park will also be finished
by mid-October, or possibly
earlier. The area will be a grassy
field suitable for volleyball and
other recreation.

A long-standing Stanford
tradition has been broken this fall,
as 468 undergraduates move into
on-campus housing without red
tile roofs. Manzanita Park, a
trailer community constructed
during the summer, is a maze of
light green buildings with white
aluminum roofs next to Branner
Hall.
The total cost of the project
has been estimated at $1,350,000,
which the Trustees authorized for
the project from site preparation
to landscaping. The construction
crew worked throughout the
summer to complete the mobile
home units, and the residents
began moving in Wednesday.

There are still several small
maintenance jobs to be
completed, but the trailers are
ready for occupancy.
The 117 trailer units provide
housing for 468 undergraduates
who would otherwise have been
forced to move off-campus. They
are expected to be in use until
1974 to ease Stanford's housing
crisis.
Each trailer unit houses four
people and has two single
bedrooms, a double bedroom, a
bath and a shower, a large
living-dining area, and a kitchen.
The units are arranged in clusters
of four around small courtyards.
Trailers Praised
The general reaction to the

trailers seems good. F.E.
Gallagher, director of Esrondido
Village and Manzanita Park, said
they have received mostly praise
so far. Few people even thought
they could be completed in time
for the start of fall quarter.
One resident described the
trailers as "off-campus living on
the campus, which you can't find
anywhere else". The rent is $205
a quarter, which is about $68 a
month.
The interiors of the trailers are
furnished, and one student
described the decor as "fantastic".
Residents have to buy their
own linens, kitchenware, and
tableware. A list distributed at the
Manzanita Park office estimates

the cost of linens at $25.20 per
person and of dishes and silver at
$7.00. A complete kitchenware
set is estimated at $40, which
would be $10 a person. Many
residents will spend much less
after bringing linens or
kitchenware from home.
Problems Voiced
The main complaints have been
that there are only three desks for
the four people in each unit and
that the inside walls are very thin.
There is also little closet space,
especially in the double bedroom.
