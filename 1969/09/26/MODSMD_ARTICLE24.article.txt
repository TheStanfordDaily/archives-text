# Flo-Mo Goes Coed
## 
### 
For the first time since it was
completed in 1956, Florence
Moore Hall is accommodating
men.
Two wings of its seven-wing
complex, Cardenal and Loro,
house 50 incoming freshman men
each, according to a plan
approved by the University Board
of Trustees.
The move extends the "house
plan" of residential education to
Moore for the first time, it was
pointed out, under a plan
launched nearly five years ago to
conduct some general classes in
residential units.

The innovation also will allow
more flexibility in planning for
both Wilbur and Stern Halls,
which were previously designated
as coeducational two years ago.
Florence Moore will not
actually become a
"coeducational" dormitory,
which means men and women
students sharing dining facilities
and living on alternate floors of
the same building, it was
explained.
Cardenal and Loro wings have
separate dining rooms as well as
living areas which the freshman
men use.
