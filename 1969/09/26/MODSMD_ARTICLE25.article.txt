# New Deans Appointed
## 
### 
Peter Z. Bulkeley, associate
professor of mechanical
engineering, has been appointed
dean of students at Stanford
University.
Prof. Bulkeley replaces Dean
Joel P. Smith, who resigned in
January to accept the presidency
of Denlson University effective
July 15.
Prof. Bulkeley's appointment is
effective immediately, President
Pitzer said.
Dean Bulkeley is a native of
San Francisco who attended
Menlo School and was graduated
in mathematics from Bowdoin
College, Maine, in 1956.
He took an additional
bachelor's degree in 1956 and a
master of science degree from
Massachusetts Institute of
Technology in 1957, and earned
his doctorate in engineering
mechanics from Stanford in 1962.
He joined the Stanford faculty
in 1957 as an instructor, and after
periods as a research assistant and
acting assistant professor, he was
appointed assistant professor in
1962 in conjunction with his
doctorate.
He was named director of the
design division of the Department
of Mechanical Engineering by
Engineering Dean Joseph M. Pettit
in 1964. He was promoted to
associate professor in 1965.
Noted as an excellent
undergraduate teacher, Dean
Bulkeley has also served as faculty
associate to El Toro Eating Club
and at Trancos House in Wilbur
Hall, freshman dormitory.

Fred A. Hargadon, dean of
admissions at Swarthmore College
since 1964, will become Stanford
University's dean of admissions
this fall, President Kenneth S.
Pitzer has announced.
He replaces Rixford K. Snyder,
who after 19 years in the position,
left it to become director of
alumni attitude research and
director of alumni colleges abroad
for the Stanford Alumni
Association.
Hargadon, 35, was chosen after
a nationwide search by a
committee of faculty, students,
and University officers headed by
Ernest R. Hilgard, professor of
psychology and education.
"The Dean of Admissions is a
very important position,
particularly now when we are
trying to change the character of
our student body," Hilgard said.
A new, more flexible policy on
admissions, which seeks greater
academic and social diversity
among incoming students, was
adopted last fall by the faculty.
Last spring, Stanford committed

itself to doubling minority
enrollment by the 1969-70
academic year.
"The minority communities
are indeed fortunate that
Stanford is able to attract a man
with the sensitivity of Mr.
Hargadon," said Simmons. "The
committee feels he understands
well the black and
Mexican-American communities
and certainly will continue efforts
already under way and
significantly increase their
enrollment at Stanford."

Two new assistant directors of
admissions have begun their work
at Stanford University, with
special emphasis on minority
students.
Monte Perez, 22, a
Mexican-American, and Milton
(Rick) Turner, who is black, will
work with Stanford's new director
of admissions, Fred A. Hargadon.
Perez, student body president
of James A. Garfield High School
in East Los Angeles, is a 1969
graduate of California State
College at Los Angeles.
While there, he helped establish
the United Mexican-American
Students, and later helped UMAS
organize units throughout Los
Angeles. He was supervisor of Cal
State's student counseling staff.
Perez also was active in the
Educational Opportunities
Program at the college.
Turner, 28, is from Hartford,
Conn., did his undergraduate
work at Linfield College, Ore.,
and received an M.A. in social
psychology in 1968 from the
University of Connecticut.
Before coming to Stanford, he
was associate director of the
Connecticut Talent Assistance
Cooperative, which works with all

high schools in the state to
identity high risk students who
have college potential.

Two new Assistant Deans of
Students have been appointed to
work with the increased number
of blacks and Chicanos on the
Stanford Campus.
Felix Guiterrez, began his job
of coordinating Mexican-
American student relations at the
University September 1. He
formerly was public information
officer for EYOA, an umbrella
type organization that coordinates
all youth activities in Los Angeles
County.
Harold K. Boyd, Stanford
newest black administrator, is a
former official with the Upward
Bound program under the Office
of Economic Opportunity. He,
too, joined the University staff on
September 1.

Prof. William Clebsch, religion,
has been elected chairman of the
Senate of the Stanford Academic
Council, effective in September.
Others elected to the Steering
Committee of the Senate for
1969-70 include Profs. Phil
Dawson, history; G.L. Bach,
economics and business; Merrill
Carlsmith, psychology; and
Thomas Ehrlich, law.
This will be the second year of
operation for the Academic
Senate. Last year the group was
headed by Prof. Leonard Schiff,
physics.
