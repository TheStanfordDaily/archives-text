# School of Education To Be Built By '72
## 
### 
A $4 million grant for
construction of a new building to
house Stanford's School of
Education's research and
development program was
announced in Washington by the
U.S. Office of Education.
Construction is not expected
to be completed before late 1972.
The University has begun
selection of an architectural firm
to assist with the design.
The building, which will
comprise 60,000 square feet, will
have one of the most recent types
of information handling systems,
which will be linked with the
University's existing computer
facilities.
The building will be located on
Galvez St. opposite Stern Hall
dormitory near the Undergraduate
Library and the School of
Education.

The existing research and
development program has been
occupying rental quarters in the
University's professional area on
Welch Road.
The new building will be fitted
for "observing, recording and
reproducing the activities of
students and teachers," according
to Prof. Robert N. Bush, director
of the School of Education's
Center for Research and
Development in Teaching, the
program's formal title. Videotape
recording and telemetering will be
among the electronic techniques
used.
"The center," Prof. Bush
explained, "has as its central
mission an attempt to delineate
the necessary and appropriate new
roles for the teacher as modern
technology moves into a central
place in the schools."
