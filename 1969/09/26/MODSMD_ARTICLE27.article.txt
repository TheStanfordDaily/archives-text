# Campus Disruption Committee Chosen
## 
### 
Five faculty members have
been selected for the president's
consultative group on campus
disruptions at Stanford.
Approved without dissent by
the faculty Senate, the committee
includes Profs. Sidney Drell of the
Stanford Linear Accelerator
Center; Thomas Ehrlich, law;
Patrick Ford, English; Herant
Katchadourian, psychiatry; and
