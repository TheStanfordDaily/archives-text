# SRI Trials
## Six Found Guilty 
### CRAIG WILSON 
The trials of demonstrators
arrested in the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) disorders last
spring continued through the
summer with six persons receiving
convictions and another facing
retrial as the result of a hung jury.
Anti-war demonstrators and
April Third Movement members
Myron Filene and Jeanne Fried
man, both Stanford students and
Scott Johnson, Karen Davidson,
Jim Snyder, and James Gage, were
found guilty on charges stemming
from a demonstration May 16 at
the SRI facility on Hanover Street
in Palo Alto.
The charges for all but Gage
were disturbing the peace, trespas
sing, obstructing free passage and
unlawful assembly.
Gage had pleaded no contest to
two violations of the vehicle code
and to malicious mischief and
obstructing free movement at the
demonstration.
Gage, 23, an unemployed
technicion from Menlo Park was
sentenced to 15 days in jail, fined
$315 and put on six months
formal probation.
Earlier in the summer two
students Karen Davidson and Jim
Snyder pleaded no contest for
their participation in last spring's
disruption.
Nine Groups
Filene, Miss Friedman and
Johnson were convicted after a
twelve day trial.
Miss Friedman received 150
days suspended from a 180-day
jail term.
Probation
In addition to 30 days in the
Santa Clara County jail she was
placed on three years' probÂ«'<tion
for trespassing with intent to
interfere on SRI property. Filene
also drew five days and three
years probation. His sentence was
suspended from 180 days.
Despite the recommendation of
the county probation officer for
straight fines, convictions and jail
terms resulted.
Miss Friedman and Johnson
also had the charge of inciting to
riot tacked on to their conviction.
They are the first of nine
groups to be tried on charges
stemming from the SRI demon
strations.
The groups are divided into
persons arrested simultaneously
SCLC
Results of last Spring's election
for positions on the Student
Conduct Legislative Council
(SCLC) have been announced.
Pending ratification by the new
ASSU Senate, the new members
are Yale Braunstein, graduate
student, economics; Harvey
Hukari, graduate student, com
munications; Roger Reed, senior,
political science. Alternates are
Bill Boyd, Tony Maran, and Mike
Wolf.
In the event one of those
elected ceases his membership on
the council, the alternate of
highest position shall succeed to
the position.

for the same charges. Nearly 100
persons, mostly Stanford Univer
sity students, were arrested in the
wake of the demonstration.
Thus far all of the defendants
have been acting as their own
counsel during the trials. At the
sentencings, lawyer James
Wolpman acted as their attorney.
Wolpman has announced that
the conviction will be appealed.
Judge Edward C. Scoyen of the
Palo Alto-Mountain View Munici
pal court granted a 10-day execu
tion of the sentence to allow time
for filing the necessary appeal on
September 3.
"Aura of Politics"
Wolpman asked for a new trial
before sentencing, suggesting that
there was an "aura of politics"
about the trial, that he thought it
would be "very unusual to impose
any sort of imprisonment" for the
first time offenders. Scoyen
denied the motion.
Wolpman added that the
defendants did everything in their
power to prevent the May 16
demonstration. They attended
meetings and spoke and worked
very hard to prevent the confron
tation.
Miss Friedman and Filene re
ceived jail sentences nonetheless.
Sentencing for Johnson was
deferred for psychiatric evalua
tion. Earlier this week Johnson
was arrested on warrants issued by
the San Jose Milpitas Municipal
Court for passing bad checks and
for a vehicle code violation.
He also faces possible perjury
charges, stemming from his sworn
testimony at the trial.
False Testimony
He testified that he was
wounded on a Vietnam battlefield
while administering first aid as a
Marine Corps medic. He said that
he had been assigned the medical
duties after he refused to carry a
gun.
A check made at a routine
probation hearing indicated that
Johnson was never in Vietnam nor
in the U.S. Armed Services,
according to officials.
Johnson faces further charges
of disturbing the peace after he
was arrested late last weekend at a
grocery store protesting the sale
of grapes.
Hunt; Jury
Another student, Marc Sapir,
faces retrial after this summer's
trial ended in a hung jury. Sapir
argued that there was a conspiracy
among various law enforcement
officers and officials to arrest him.
Filene is a Stanford senior in
English from Covina. Johnson is a
non-student from Chicago.
Miss Friedman, 28, earned her
bachelor's degree at the City
College of New York. For the past
six years she has been a graduate
political science student at Stan
ford.
It was announced soon after
her conviction that she had been
appointed an instructor in pol
itical science at the University of
Redlands.
Job in Jeopardy
Miss Friedman has said that

J
since that time her Redlands
teaching job had been placed in
jeopardy in part because of
discussion between the district
attorney's office and Redlands
representatives.
The trials were characterized by
numerous witnesses for both the
prosecution and the defense.
Among those named by defendant
subpoenas were Charles Anderson,
SRI president; Weldon Gibson,
executive vice president and dir
ector of SRI International; Ken
neth Beggs, vice president for
economics; Gordon Parker, execu
tive assistant to the vice president;
SRI-International Homer Meaders
Jr., director of public relations;
and Lloyd Schuknecht and Milton
Norum, both SRI security guards.
Arbuckle Served
Also served was Ernest Ar
buckle, trustee of both Stanford
University and SRI and former
dean of the Graduate School of
Business.
Judge Scoyen imposed the jail
term and probation with condi
tions that both Friedman and
Filene would be liable for the
stayed jail sentences if convicted
of any crime more serious than
traffic offenses during the three
year period. He imposed no fines.
Condemned Tactics
He condemned the violent
tactics of the demonstration
which he said, "didn't do a thing
for your cause and caused the
biggest traffic jam in the history
of North Santa Clara County."
The judge called the demonstra
tion pointless since SRI was
already in the process of vacating
the two-story glass and steel
building and because the future
relationship between SRI and
Stanford University had been
decided before the demonstration
took place.
"Lord knows how many
thousand people were inconven
ienced because you felt you were
doing something so right that
those people didn't count," Judge
Scoyen said in court.
Road Blocks
The demonstrators set up road
blocks in front of SRI on Page
Mill Road at the Hanover inter
section causing a mammoth traffic
jam.
Students James Shoch, Irving
A. Busse, and non-student Tim
Gadus, members of the "building
group" of the April Third Move
ment, have pleaded no contest
(nolo contendre) to malicious
mischief charges. The second
group of defendants are to be
sentenced at 1:30 p.m. September
30.
District Attorney Craig Brown
reports that, due to the large
number of demonstrators yet to
be prosecuted and overlaps in trial
scheduling, most trial dates must
be rescheduled.
There are nine groups of
students, or a total of 77 people
yet to be prosecuted. In addition
there are still 24 warrants out
standing.
Marc Sapir is scheduled be
begin a new trial on October 14
while the trial of Steve Kessler, a
demonstrator indicted on five
separate counts, wil! begin trial
October 21.
