## 
### FELICITY BARRINGER 
The academic year 1969-70 has
not yet officially started at
Stanford, but a controversy has
already developed over the
legality of a mailing sent to
freshmen and transfer students by
Jim Schnicder, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC).
The mailing, dated September
12, included a copy of the
recently adopted Constitution of
the Associated Students, a
pamphlet from the CAC
(including the pledge of the CAC
"To work for positive change
through rational discussion . .
as well as eight pictures of the
disturbance at the Stanford
Research Institute last Spring), a
football schedule-postcard printed
by Stickney's restaurants, and a
letter to each freshman and
transfer.
Included in the letter were a
resume of the CAC's beliefs, and a

recommendation to the recipients
to look into joining the Student
Senate, a University committee,
and the Daily. The letter was
signed by Schneider.
Pre-Reg Recommendation
A recommendation adopted by
the Pre-Registration Planning
Committee early this summer
states that "... all mailings to
new freshmen be delayed until
freshman Wednesday; that the
Planning Committee be the final
authority in resolving
controversies and disputes arising
from such proposed mailings,"
according to Renton Rolph,
chairman of the Preßeg
Commission.

authorized last May by the
Committee on Committees of the

No formal declaration of the

to Rolph, ''Legality doesn't imply
there must be a University-wide
proclamation, when everyone who
wants to send a mailing must go
to the Dean of Students office."
He added that that office would
inform those requesting mailings
the restrictions placed on the
mailings.
Eight mailings were sent to
freshmen and transfers following
their notices of acceptance—seven
from various University offices
and one from the Pre-Reg
commission.
Other University groups,
including the Glee Club, the
Choir, and the Classics

Department requested a total of
ten mailings. Of these, only the
Stanford Band was permitted to
send one to those freshmen and
transfers who had indicated
musical interests.
Pat Shea, a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
commented to the
Daily concerning the affair, "When
the community decides
something, the members of the
community should abide by it or
seek to change it. Mr. Schnieder
apparently does not agree with
this."
"It's totally illegal," said
Rolph, who added that he
believed Schnieder knew of the
ruling since, during the spring and
summer, he had held
conversations with Schnieder
during which the subject of
mailings had come ud.
Schnieder said he would issue
a statement in the near future

authority in resolving
controversies and disputes arising
from such proposed mailings,"
according to Renton Rolph,
chairman of the Preßeg
Commission.
The Planning Committee was
authorized last May by the
Committee on Committees of the
Faculty Senate.
No formal declaration of the
ruling whs issued; but, according
to Rolph, ''Legality doesn't imply
there must be a University-wide
proclamation, when everyone who
wants to send a mailing must go
to the Dean of Students office."
He added that that office would
inform those requesting mailings
the restrictions placed on the
mailings.
Eight mailings were sent to
freshmen and transfers following
their notices of acceptance—seven
from various University offices
and one from the Pre-Reg
commission.
Other University groups,
including the Glee Club, the
Choir, and the Classics

Department requested a total of
ten mailings. Of these, only the
Stanford Band was permitted to
send one to those freshmen and
transfers who had indicated
musical interests.
Pat Shea, a member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
commented to the
Daily concerning the affair, "When
the community decides
something, the members of the
community should abide by it or
seek to change it. Mr. Schnieder
apparently does not agree with
this."
"It's totally illegal," said
Rolph, who added that he
believed Schnieder knew of the
ruling since, during the spring and
summer, he had held
conversations with Schnieder
during which the subject of
mailings had come ud.
Schnieder said he would issue
a statement in the near future
The academic year 1969-70 has
not yet officially started at
Stanford, but a controversy has
already developed over the
legality of a mailing sent to
freshmen and transfer students by
Jim Schnicder, president of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC).
The mailing, dated September
12, included a copy of the
recently adopted Constitution of
the Associated Students, a
pamphlet from the CAC
(including the pledge of the CAC
"To work for positive change
through rational discussion . .
as well as eight pictures of the
disturbance at the Stanford
Research Institute last Spring), a
football schedule-postcard printed
by Stickney's restaurants, and a
letter to each freshman and
transfer.
Included in the letter were a
resume of the CAC's beliefs, and a

recommendation to the recipients
to look into joining the Student
Senate, a University committee,
and the Daily. The letter was
signed by Schneider.
Pre-Reg Recommendation
A recommendation adopted by
the Pre-Registration Planning
Committee early this summer
states that "... all mailings to
new freshmen be delayed until
freshman Wednesday; that the
Planning Committee be the final
authority in resolving
controversies and disputes arising
from such proposed mailings,"
according to Renton Rolph,
chairman of the Preßeg
Commission.
The Planning Committee was
authorized last May by the
Committee on Committees of the
