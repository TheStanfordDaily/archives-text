# Penalties Decided For Encina Sit-In

Forty-eight Stanford students
were placed on probation in
mid-June as a result of their
participation in the May 1 Encina
Hall sit-in. In addition, fourteen
students were suspended for the
same action. All fourteen had
participated in the January 14
Trustee meeting disruption.
The probations and
suspensions were ordered by
President Kenneth Pitzer, acting
on recommendations from the
Stanford Judicial Council (SJC).
The last such mass penalty
occurred in the early 1900's when
several men, disgruntled over a
liquor raid, urinated on the lawn
of the President.
Of the 48 students on
probation, 47 were fined a total
of $3,525, almost all fines being
$75. Their probation periods

extend through June, 1970.
Probation means that the student
may not hold a position of "trust
and responsibility" with the
University. It also means that
another violation of university
policy will lead to suspension.
According to Prof. Jack
Friedenthal, head of the
student-faculty SJC, most of the
cases are closed. There are five
people who didn't show up for
their open hearing. Some of these
are now negotiating with
Friedenthal. They must appear
before they will be eligible to
re-enroll.
Peter Bulkeley, new Dean of
Students, has declined to release
the names of those suspended or
put on probation. He fears that
such release might by harmful to
the students involved. Already he
has had two requests for the
names by groups of the Stanford
community whose "politics are in
direct opposition to those who
sat-in." Bulkeley doesn't agree
with the sit-in tactic himself,
calling the affair "unfortunate."
Bill Stone, Assistant Dean of
Students, reports that only ten of
the 47 have paid their fines.
However, this is expected to
change after registration. The
fines must be paid before the
student can re-enroll.
All but one of the suspended
students will be allowed to
re-enroll Winter quarter. Those on
suspension may not attend class,
use any academic facilities, or live
in University residences.
The Encina sit-in was the
culmination of several weeks of
activity Spring Quarter, which saw
the development of the April 3rd
Movement in opposition to
war-related research being done
on campus and at Stanford
Research Institute (SRI). The
A3M and supporters occupied the
Applied Electronics Laboratory in
April.
Encina sit-in itself began after
midnight on May 1 when about
200 people broke into the
administrative hall, breaching
opposition by a few members of
the Young Americans for
Freedom. Six hours later more
than 100 demonstrators left under
threat of arrest by 100 Santa
Clara sheriff's deputies. Damage
to windows an office equipment
was more than $2500.
