# Fairmont Meeting
## Pickets Greet Businessmen 
### CRAIG WILSON 
World business and industrial
leaders meeting atop San
Francisco's Nob Hill last week got
a taste of some of the resistance
met by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) in campus
demonstrations last spring.
The occasion was the
International Industrial
Conference (IIC), bringing
together more than 700 top
executives from 70 nations. The
conference was sponsored by SRI
of Menlo Park.
An estimated 500 chanting,
marching demonstrators snaked
through the financial district on
two separate days as squads of
riot equipped police moved
alongside them regulating the
movement of the marchers.
The most serious incident in
the five-day conference broke out
Thursday evening when skirmishes
between young demonstrators and
police resulted in 20 arrests.
Stanford Arrest
Another 10 demonstrators
were arrested during the
remainder of the week including
Larry Christiani, a Stanford
student and member of the April
Third Movement last spring.
Thursday's trouble began after
demonstrators left the Fairmont
Hotel where the industrialists had
been gathering since early
morning.
The demonstrators left in
various-sized groups in different
directions and according to police
began damaging windows and
causing general havoc.
Officers chased the young
people around the Market,
Stockton, and Grant Avenue area.
Reports said that windows were
broken and newspaper stands
thrown into the streets during the
chase.
About 70 of the demonstrators
returned to the hotel after the
early evening skirmishes but no
trouble followed.
Late Arrests
About 350 persons had massed
for the morning rally as the
delegates paraded into the ancient
Fairmont hotel. The arrests
occurred later after demonstrators
had been outside the hotel for
several hours.
Fourteen people were arrested
after Tactical Squad officers said
demonstrators broke a large
display window at H. Liebes and
Co., at Grant and Geary. Five
others were arrested after
following Tactical Squad members
with shouts and taunts.
On Monday an estimated 500
chanting demonstrators paraded
through the business district on
their first march to the Fairmont.
Police Waiting
When they arrived they found
large numbers of club-bearing
police fronting the famous hotel.
The marchers were ushered
behind wooden barriers across the
street from the Fairmont.
Marchers were orderly along the
route and broke up less than an
hour after their arrival.
Both marches had been
organized months before by a
coalition of fraternal radical
organizations. The group included
Los Siete de la Raza, a
Mexican-American group,
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the Asian Coalition,
Women's Liberation Front, Bay
Area High School Students Union
and the Haight commune.
Ralph Ruis a spokesman for
Los Siete de Li Raza said of the
marches, "We intend to stop these
men from completing their goals

both at the Fairmont and at
Montgomery Street. These
Industrialists will be safe neither
behind the oak door of the
Fairmont nor in their high rise
glass confines on Montgomery
Street."., , .
Marchers Assemble
Marchers assembled in
Washington Square in North
Beach for the scheduled 11 a.m.
march on Monday. After some
discussion of tactics and
motivational political goals the
demonstrators marched to the
Fairmont. They were told by
police that without a parade
permit they must remain on the
sidewalks.
The march itself was peaceful
if noisy. Chants such as "Ho, Ho,
Ho, Chi Minh, the NLF is goona
win," "Power to the People" and
"Rocky to his grave" could be
heard as large numbers of red flags
and photographs of the deceased
Vietnamese leader dotted the
crowd.
The group was paced by squads
of police who forced them to
remain on sidewalks and obey
traffic signals. Marchers were told
to walk single file on the
crosswalks. At least two violators
were arrested. All together 11
people were arrested in the
Monday march.
Prepared Early
Police at the hotel had been
prepared since the early morning
as they were all week.

A few delegates to the
conference watched curiously
from the hotel entrance, but there
were no incidents.
Inside delegates were addressed
by heads of governments and
kingpins of the industrial world.
Thursday, Secretary of
Commerce Maurice H. Stans,
keynote speaker at the conference
banquet, asserted that "those who
are trying to destroy the nation
have crawled back under their
rocks."
Builds Country
"The American enterprise
system built this country—it gave
us everything we have and it can
give us everything we want: and it
will not be destroyed by the
senseless attacks of radicals who
can produce nothing."
Stans, an investment banker
before his Nixon cabinet
appointment, blamed by
implication the rising cost of
living on the administration of
former President Johnson.
"Today's inflation is the price
of five years of reckless fiscal
policies and if we were to jam on
the brakes while traveling at high
speed we could only expect a
crash which would hurt others as
well as ourselves.
"But," he declared, "we will
not permit the continued erosion
of the dollar."
Rockefeller Speaks
David Rockefeller, President of

the Chase Manhattan Bank,
addressed the businessmen earlier
in the week.
Rockefeller protested that the
radical young pickets outside the
hotel failed to understand that he
and the assembled industrialists
shared their hope of wanting to
close the income gap between the
rich and the poor.
"We are concerned rather, with
the very same problems and
people they are," the banker with
the celebrated family name said at
a press conference after delivering
the keynote address. "We feel
that what we are trying to do is
constructive and many who have
come here have done a great deal
more than those calling us
names."
People Inside
Among others inside for the
Monday beginning were Roger
Blough, director of United States
Steel Corporation. Blough noted
that many of today's problems
had their time origin in the
1930'5, '40s, '50s and even before.
In this he put such questions as
inflation, mass transportation,
unclear air and water, obsolesence
in political institutions, and the
plight of the elderly and the
undernourished.
One of the main topics
discussed was how the
businessmen could keep
underdeveloped countries from
thinking of them as ruthless
exploiters.
Foreign Victim
"The truth is that Mexico was
a victim of foreign domination
until we forced a change in the
1930'5," Eustaquio Escandon, a
Mexican industrialist told his
colleagues.
"How do you think you would
like it in the United States if your
chemical industry was in German
hands, your banks in British
control and your steel industry
100 per cent under Japanese
ownership—whether they did a
good job or a poor job?"
Strong Disagreement
The stronger disagreement to
these views came from top
executives of two American firms,
Jacques G. Maisonrouge, president
of IVM World Trade Corporation,
and William Blackie, chairman of
the board of Caterpillar Tractor
Company. Both said their
subsidiaries abroad are 100 per
cent owned by the parent
companies.

On Monday an estimated 500
chanting demonstrators paraded
through the business district on
their first march to the Fairmont.
Police Waiting
When they arrived they found
large numbers of club-bearing
police fronting the famous hotel.
The marchers were ushered
behind wooden barriers across the
street from the Fairmont.
Marchers were orderly along the
route and broke up less than an
hour after their arrival.
Both marches had been
organized months before by a
coalition of fraternal radical
organizations. The group included
Los Siete de la Raza, a
Mexican-American group,
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the Asian Coalition,
Women's Liberation Front, Bay
Area High School Students Union
and the Haight commune.
Ralph Ruis a spokesman for
Los Siete de Li Raza said of the
marches, "We intend to stop these
men from completing their goals

both at the Fairmont and at
Montgomery Street. These
Industrialists will be safe neither
behind the oak door of the
Fairmont nor in their high rise
glass confines on Montgomery
Street."., , .
Marchers Assemble
Marchers assembled in
Washington Square in North
Beach for the scheduled 11 a.m.
march on Monday. After some
discussion of tactics and
motivational political goals the
demonstrators marched to the
Fairmont. They were told by
police that without a parade
permit they must remain on the
sidewalks.
The march itself was peaceful
if noisy. Chants such as "Ho, Ho,
Ho, Chi Minh, the NLF is goona
win," "Power to the People" and
"Rocky to his grave" could be
heard as large numbers of red flags
and photographs of the deceased
Vietnamese leader dotted the
crowd.
The group was paced by squads
of police who forced them to
remain on sidewalks and obey
traffic signals. Marchers were told
to walk single file on the
crosswalks. At least two violators
were arrested. All together 11
people were arrested in the
Monday march.
Prepared Early
Police at the hotel had been
prepared since the early morning
as they were all week.

A few delegates to the
conference watched curiously
from the hotel entrance, but there
were no incidents.
Inside delegates were addressed
by heads of governments and
kingpins of the industrial world.
Thursday, Secretary of
Commerce Maurice H. Stans,
keynote speaker at the conference
banquet, asserted that "those who
are trying to destroy the nation
have crawled back under their
rocks."
Builds Country
"The American enterprise
system built this country—it gave
us everything we have and it can
give us everything we want: and it
will not be destroyed by the
senseless attacks of radicals who
can produce nothing."
Stans, an investment banker
before his Nixon cabinet
appointment, blamed by
implication the rising cost of
living on the administration of
former President Johnson.
"Today's inflation is the price
of five years of reckless fiscal
policies and if we were to jam on
the brakes while traveling at high
speed we could only expect a
crash which would hurt others as
well as ourselves.
"But," he declared, "we will
not permit the continued erosion
of the dollar."
Rockefeller Speaks
David Rockefeller, President of

the Chase Manhattan Bank,
addressed the businessmen earlier
in the week.
Rockefeller protested that the
radical young pickets outside the
hotel failed to understand that he
and the assembled industrialists
shared their hope of wanting to
close the income gap between the
rich and the poor.
"We are concerned rather, with
the very same problems and
people they are," the banker with
the celebrated family name said at
a press conference after delivering
the keynote address. "We feel
that what we are trying to do is
constructive and many who have
come here have done a great deal
more than those calling us
names."
People Inside
Among others inside for the
Monday beginning were Roger
Blough, director of United States
Steel Corporation. Blough noted
that many of today's problems
had their time origin in the
1930'5, '40s, '50s and even before.
In this he put such questions as
inflation, mass transportation,
unclear air and water, obsolesence
in political institutions, and the
plight of the elderly and the
undernourished.
One of the main topics
discussed was how the
businessmen could keep
underdeveloped countries from
thinking of them as ruthless
exploiters.
Foreign Victim
"The truth is that Mexico was
a victim of foreign domination
until we forced a change in the
1930'5," Eustaquio Escandon, a
Mexican industrialist told his
colleagues.
"How do you think you would
like it in the United States if your
chemical industry was in German
hands, your banks in British
control and your steel industry
100 per cent under Japanese
ownership—whether they did a
good job or a poor job?"
Strong Disagreement
The stronger disagreement to
these views came from top
executives of two American firms,
Jacques G. Maisonrouge, president
of IVM World Trade Corporation,
and William Blackie, chairman of
the board of Caterpillar Tractor
Company. Both said their
subsidiaries abroad are 100 per
cent owned by the parent
companies.

CLOSELY WATCHED TRAlN—Police watch demonstrators to make sure that
they remain on the sidewalks in the march to the Montgomery Street financial
district before heading up to Nob Hill, center for 700 industrialists attending
world business conference.
World business and industrial
leaders meeting atop San
Francisco's Nob Hill last week got
a taste of some of the resistance
met by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) in campus
demonstrations last spring.
The occasion was the
International Industrial
Conference (IIC), bringing
together more than 700 top
executives from 70 nations. The
conference was sponsored by SRI
of Menlo Park.
An estimated 500 chanting,
marching demonstrators snaked
through the financial district on
two separate days as squads of
riot equipped police moved
alongside them regulating the
movement of the marchers.
The most serious incident in
the five-day conference broke out
Thursday evening when skirmishes
between young demonstrators and
police resulted in 20 arrests.
Stanford Arrest
Another 10 demonstrators
were arrested during the
remainder of the week including
Larry Christiani, a Stanford
student and member of the April
Third Movement last spring.
Thursday's trouble began after
demonstrators left the Fairmont
Hotel where the industrialists had
been gathering since early
morning.
The demonstrators left in
various-sized groups in different
directions and according to police
began damaging windows and
causing general havoc.
Officers chased the young
people around the Market,
Stockton, and Grant Avenue area.
Reports said that windows were
broken and newspaper stands
thrown into the streets during the
chase.
About 70 of the demonstrators
returned to the hotel after the
early evening skirmishes but no
trouble followed.
Late Arrests
About 350 persons had massed
for the morning rally as the
delegates paraded into the ancient
Fairmont hotel. The arrests
occurred later after demonstrators
had been outside the hotel for
several hours.
Fourteen people were arrested
after Tactical Squad officers said
demonstrators broke a large
display window at H. Liebes and
Co., at Grant and Geary. Five
others were arrested after
following Tactical Squad members
with shouts and taunts.

Police at the hotel had been
prepared since the early morning
as they were all week.

A few delegates to the
conference watched curiously
from the hotel entrance, but there
were no incidents.
Inside delegates were addressed
by heads of governments and
kingpins of the industrial world.
Thursday, Secretary of
Commerce Maurice H. Stans,
keynote speaker at the conference
banquet, asserted that "those who
are trying to destroy the nation
have crawled back under their
rocks."
Builds Country
"The American enterprise
system built this country—it gave
us everything we have and it can
give us everything we want: and it
will not be destroyed by the
senseless attacks of radicals who
can produce nothing."
Stans, an investment banker
before his Nixon cabinet
appointment, blamed by
implication the rising cost of
living on the administration of
former President Johnson.
"Today's inflation is the price
of five years of reckless fiscal
policies and if we were to jam on
the brakes while traveling at high
speed we could only expect a
crash which would hurt others as
well as ourselves.
"But," he declared, "we will
not permit the continued erosion
of the dollar."
Rockefeller Speaks
David Rockefeller, President of

the Chase Manhattan Bank,
addressed the businessmen earlier
in the week.
Rockefeller protested that the
radical young pickets outside the
hotel failed to understand that he
and the assembled industrialists
shared their hope of wanting to
close the income gap between the
rich and the poor.
"We are concerned rather, with
the very same problems and
people they are," the banker with
the celebrated family name said at
a press conference after delivering
the keynote address. "We feel
that what we are trying to do is
constructive and many who have
come here have done a great deal
more than those calling us
names."
People Inside
Among others inside for the
Monday beginning were Roger
Blough, director of United States
Steel Corporation. Blough noted
that many of today's problems
had their time origin in the
1930'5, '40s, '50s and even before.
In this he put such questions as
inflation, mass transportation,
unclear air and water, obsolesence
in political institutions, and the
plight of the elderly and the
undernourished.
One of the main topics
discussed was how the
businessmen could keep
underdeveloped countries from
thinking of them as ruthless
exploiters.
Foreign Victim
"The truth is that Mexico was
a victim of foreign domination
until we forced a change in the
1930'5," Eustaquio Escandon, a
Mexican industrialist told his
colleagues.
"How do you think you would
like it in the United States if your
chemical industry was in German
hands, your banks in British
control and your steel industry
100 per cent under Japanese
ownership—whether they did a
good job or a poor job?"
Strong Disagreement
The stronger disagreement to
these views came from top
executives of two American firms,
Jacques G. Maisonrouge, president
of IVM World Trade Corporation,
and William Blackie, chairman of
the board of Caterpillar Tractor
Company. Both said their
subsidiaries abroad are 100 per
cent owned by the parent
companies.

CLOSELY WATCHED TRAlN—Police watch demonstrators to make sure that
they remain on the sidewalks in the march to the Montgomery Street financial
district before heading up to Nob Hill, center for 700 industrialists attending
world business conference.
World business and industrial
leaders meeting atop San
Francisco's Nob Hill last week got
a taste of some of the resistance
met by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) in campus
demonstrations last spring.
The occasion was the
International Industrial
Conference (IIC), bringing
together more than 700 top
executives from 70 nations. The
conference was sponsored by SRI
of Menlo Park.
An estimated 500 chanting,
marching demonstrators snaked
through the financial district on
two separate days as squads of
riot equipped police moved
alongside them regulating the
movement of the marchers.
The most serious incident in
the five-day conference broke out
Thursday evening when skirmishes
between young demonstrators and
police resulted in 20 arrests.
Stanford Arrest
Another 10 demonstrators
were arrested during the
remainder of the week including
Larry Christiani, a Stanford
student and member of the April
Third Movement last spring.
Thursday's trouble began after
demonstrators left the Fairmont
Hotel where the industrialists had
been gathering since early
morning.
The demonstrators left in
various-sized groups in different
directions and according to police
began damaging windows and
causing general havoc.
Officers chased the young
people around the Market,
Stockton, and Grant Avenue area.
Reports said that windows were
broken and newspaper stands
thrown into the streets during the
chase.
About 70 of the demonstrators
returned to the hotel after the
early evening skirmishes but no
trouble followed.
Late Arrests
About 350 persons had massed
for the morning rally as the
delegates paraded into the ancient
Fairmont hotel. The arrests
occurred later after demonstrators
had been outside the hotel for
several hours.
Fourteen people were arrested
after Tactical Squad officers said
demonstrators broke a large
display window at H. Liebes and
Co., at Grant and Geary. Five
others were arrested after
following Tactical Squad members
with shouts and taunts.
On Monday an estimated 500
chanting demonstrators paraded
through the business district on
their first march to the Fairmont.
Police Waiting
When they arrived they found
large numbers of club-bearing
police fronting the famous hotel.
The marchers were ushered
behind wooden barriers across the
street from the Fairmont.
Marchers were orderly along the
route and broke up less than an
hour after their arrival.
Both marches had been
organized months before by a
coalition of fraternal radical
organizations. The group included
Los Siete de la Raza, a
Mexican-American group,
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the Asian Coalition,
Women's Liberation Front, Bay
Area High School Students Union
and the Haight commune.
Ralph Ruis a spokesman for
Los Siete de Li Raza said of the
marches, "We intend to stop these
men from completing their goals

both at the Fairmont and at
Montgomery Street. These
Industrialists will be safe neither
behind the oak door of the
Fairmont nor in their high rise
glass confines on Montgomery
Street."., , .
Marchers Assemble
Marchers assembled in
Washington Square in North
Beach for the scheduled 11 a.m.
march on Monday. After some
discussion of tactics and
motivational political goals the
demonstrators marched to the
Fairmont. They were told by
police that without a parade
permit they must remain on the
sidewalks.
The march itself was peaceful
if noisy. Chants such as "Ho, Ho,
Ho, Chi Minh, the NLF is goona
win," "Power to the People" and
"Rocky to his grave" could be
heard as large numbers of red flags
and photographs of the deceased
Vietnamese leader dotted the
crowd.
The group was paced by squads
of police who forced them to
remain on sidewalks and obey
traffic signals. Marchers were told
to walk single file on the
crosswalks. At least two violators
were arrested. All together 11
people were arrested in the
Monday march.

1930'5, '40s, '50s and even before.
In this he put such questions as
inflation, mass transportation,
unclear air and water, obsolesence
in political institutions, and the
plight of the elderly and the
undernourished.
One of the main topics
discussed was how the
businessmen could keep
underdeveloped countries from
thinking of them as ruthless
exploiters.
Foreign Victim
"The truth is that Mexico was
a victim of foreign domination
until we forced a change in the
1930'5," Eustaquio Escandon, a
Mexican industrialist told his
colleagues.
"How do you think you would
like it in the United States if your
chemical industry was in German
hands, your banks in British
control and your steel industry
100 per cent under Japanese
ownership—whether they did a
good job or a poor job?"
Strong Disagreement
The stronger disagreement to
these views came from top
executives of two American firms,
Jacques G. Maisonrouge, president
of IVM World Trade Corporation,
and William Blackie, chairman of
the board of Caterpillar Tractor
Company. Both said their
subsidiaries abroad are 100 per
cent owned by the parent
companies.

CLOSELY WATCHED TRAlN—Police watch demonstrators to make sure that
they remain on the sidewalks in the march to the Montgomery Street financial
district before heading up to Nob Hill, center for 700 industrialists attending
world business conference.
World business and industrial
leaders meeting atop San
Francisco's Nob Hill last week got
a taste of some of the resistance
met by the Stanford Research
Institute (SRI) in campus
demonstrations last spring.
The occasion was the
International Industrial
Conference (IIC), bringing
together more than 700 top
executives from 70 nations. The
conference was sponsored by SRI
of Menlo Park.
An estimated 500 chanting,
marching demonstrators snaked
through the financial district on
two separate days as squads of
riot equipped police moved
alongside them regulating the
movement of the marchers.
The most serious incident in
the five-day conference broke out
Thursday evening when skirmishes
between young demonstrators and
police resulted in 20 arrests.
Stanford Arrest
Another 10 demonstrators
were arrested during the
remainder of the week including
Larry Christiani, a Stanford
student and member of the April
Third Movement last spring.
Thursday's trouble began after
demonstrators left the Fairmont
Hotel where the industrialists had
been gathering since early
morning.
The demonstrators left in
various-sized groups in different
directions and according to police
began damaging windows and
causing general havoc.
Officers chased the young
people around the Market,
Stockton, and Grant Avenue area.
Reports said that windows were
broken and newspaper stands
thrown into the streets during the
chase.
About 70 of the demonstrators
returned to the hotel after the
early evening skirmishes but no
trouble followed.
Late Arrests
About 350 persons had massed
for the morning rally as the
delegates paraded into the ancient
Fairmont hotel. The arrests
occurred later after demonstrators
had been outside the hotel for
several hours.
Fourteen people were arrested
after Tactical Squad officers said
demonstrators broke a large
display window at H. Liebes and
Co., at Grant and Geary. Five
others were arrested after
following Tactical Squad members
with shouts and taunts.
On Monday an estimated 500
chanting demonstrators paraded
through the business district on
their first march to the Fairmont.
Police Waiting
When they arrived they found
large numbers of club-bearing
police fronting the famous hotel.
The marchers were ushered
behind wooden barriers across the
street from the Fairmont.
Marchers were orderly along the
route and broke up less than an
hour after their arrival.
Both marches had been
organized months before by a
coalition of fraternal radical
organizations. The group included
Los Siete de la Raza, a
Mexican-American group,
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS), the Asian Coalition,
Women's Liberation Front, Bay
Area High School Students Union
and the Haight commune.
Ralph Ruis a spokesman for
Los Siete de Li Raza said of the
marches, "We intend to stop these
men from completing their goals

both at the Fairmont and at
Montgomery Street. These
Industrialists will be safe neither
behind the oak door of the
Fairmont nor in their high rise
glass confines on Montgomery
Street."., , .
Marchers Assemble
Marchers assembled in
Washington Square in North
Beach for the scheduled 11 a.m.
march on Monday. After some
discussion of tactics and
motivational political goals the
demonstrators marched to the
Fairmont. They were told by
police that without a parade
permit they must remain on the
sidewalks.
The march itself was peaceful
if noisy. Chants such as "Ho, Ho,
Ho, Chi Minh, the NLF is goona
win," "Power to the People" and
"Rocky to his grave" could be
heard as large numbers of red flags
and photographs of the deceased
Vietnamese leader dotted the
crowd.
The group was paced by squads
of police who forced them to
remain on sidewalks and obey
traffic signals. Marchers were told
to walk single file on the
crosswalks. At least two violators
were arrested. All together 11
people were arrested in the
Monday march.
Prepared Early
Police at the hotel had been
prepared since the early morning
as they were all week.

A few delegates to the
conference watched curiously
from the hotel entrance, but there
were no incidents.
Inside delegates were addressed
by heads of governments and
kingpins of the industrial world.
Thursday, Secretary of
Commerce Maurice H. Stans,
keynote speaker at the conference
banquet, asserted that "those who
are trying to destroy the nation
have crawled back under their
rocks."
Builds Country
"The American enterprise
system built this country—it gave
us everything we have and it can
give us everything we want: and it
will not be destroyed by the
senseless attacks of radicals who
can produce nothing."
Stans, an investment banker
before his Nixon cabinet
appointment, blamed by
implication the rising cost of
living on the administration of
former President Johnson.
"Today's inflation is the price
of five years of reckless fiscal
policies and if we were to jam on
the brakes while traveling at high
speed we could only expect a
crash which would hurt others as
well as ourselves.
"But," he declared, "we will
not permit the continued erosion
of the dollar."
Rockefeller Speaks
David Rockefeller, President of

the Chase Manhattan Bank,
addressed the businessmen earlier
in the week.
Rockefeller protested that the
radical young pickets outside the
hotel failed to understand that he
and the assembled industrialists
shared their hope of wanting to
close the income gap between the
rich and the poor.
"We are concerned rather, with
the very same problems and
people they are," the banker with
the celebrated family name said at
a press conference after delivering
the keynote address. "We feel
that what we are trying to do is
constructive and many who have
come here have done a great deal
more than those calling us
names."
People Inside
Among others inside for the
Monday beginning were Roger
Blough, director of United States
Steel Corporation. Blough noted
that many of today's problems
had their time origin in the
1930'5, '40s, '50s and even before.
In this he put such questions as
inflation, mass transportation,
unclear air and water, obsolesence
in political institutions, and the
plight of the elderly and the
undernourished.
One of the main topics

businessmen could keep
