# A 						Saturday Romp
## Arch Victims Killed Again 
### MARSHALL E. SCHWARTZ 
For some strange reason,
Stanford decided to play a
football game this year before
anyone was on campus besides the
football players.
So on Saturday, September 20,
the Injuns gaily marched out onto
the Stanford Stadium turf to
massacre their arch-victims, the
San Jose State Spartans.
Somehow, 31,000 souls turned
up for the annual sacrificial ritual.
It is questionable how many
students were there from the
Farm (San Jose was out in
force—more on that later). It was
so early even the omnipresent
Leland Stanford Junior (pause)
University Marching Band hadn't
arrived yet. A group of would-be
musicians from Menlo-Atherton
High School acted as a noble (but
not quite sufficient) replacement.
Actually, it turned out there
was very little reason to attend
the game. It was almost a
complete rerun of last year's
morality play (Stanford=Good —in
the platonic sense; San Jose=Evil;
Good conquers Evil).
Rawboned Jim Plunkett, the
man on whom the Athletic
Department is spending several
thou in promoting him for
All-American, led the squad up
and down the neatly manicured
greensward, completing his aerials
almost at will (13 of 15, not a bad
percentage).
Don Bruce, the man who
would be a starting quarterback at
any other school on the Coast,
and almost anywhere else in the
nation, then took his turn as high
priest at the sacrifice, and after a
slow start, lived up to his
reputation.
And then, to make the brilliant
afternoon complete, little Ron
Fujikawa, the only Japanese
quarterback in college football,
made his semi-annual appearance
(San Jose State games, plus the
last three minutes of the Cal
game, only) as leader of the Big
Red.
With the entire Stanford bench
on their feet cheering him, Fuji
led the team to a touchdown, on a
10-yard pass to transplanted
hurdler Rick Tipton. As a matter
of fact, Fuji threw two beautiful
strikes to Rick on the touchdown

drive. Fujikawa to Tipton. Ah, it
has a lyrical ring. Almost enough
to make you forget Plunkett to
Washington (Gene last year,
Demea this go-round).
But don't start smelling roses
quite yet. It began this way last
year —and then there was
Southern Cal. Or, to be exact,
there wasn't Shoemaker. When
the placement specialist got
injured last year, Steve Horowitz
was suddenly pressed into service.
A fine linebacker, Steve's only
kicking experience was an
occasional extra point in high
school.
Those three missed field goals
in the 27-24 loss to SC were
enough to make John Ralston cry.
After that disheartening defeat,
the team went downhill for three
weeks before coming back to take
its last three in a row.
There are still problems,
however. Hillary Shockloy didn't
look like a third-string fullback
out there. In fact, he was very
reminiscent of Nate
Kirtman—unfortunately in more
ways than one.
Not only did Shockley display
the same hard-driving power that
Nate always showed, he seemed to
have the same sad tendency to
drop the ball at inoportune
moments, just as Nate did.
He wasn't the only one
dropping things out there. The
Injuns fumbled six times, and
managed to get only two of them
back. The strangest episode was
when Jim Kauffman, Superfrosh
two years ago, outran his blockers
on a kick return and collided with
one of them, dropping the ball.
And then there were those two
unfortunate slips on defense —the
first when Frank Slaton slipped
down the left sideline on a kickoff
return and went 98 yards for a
score, without a red shirt coming
within shouting distance; and the
second when the diminutive
flanker, Larry Merlini, slipped
through about a dozen Injun
hands and charged 20 yards up
the middle for a TD.
If the sloppiness is cleared up,
the Impossible Dream may be
realized.
Things should be a little more
interesting tomorrow when
Oregon comes to town. At least

the Band should be back, and the
new cheerleaders (Right On!) And
there won't be that strange crew
that showed up from SJS. A few
of them were merrily blowing
whistles and confusing the
referees on the field (the players
managed to survive—the refs are a
bit denser).
And then there was this one
cheerleader, shouting like his
audience was totally deaf and
banging madly at every drum in
sight. Eventually his fellows
restrained him.
Unfortunately for Spartan
fans, their team was unable to
restrain the Big Red.

look like a third-string fullback
out there. In fact, he was very
reminiscent of Nate
Kirtman—unfortunately in more
ways than one.
Not only did Shockley display
the same hard-driving power that
Nate always showed, he seemed to
have the same sad tendency to
drop the ball at inoportune
moments, just as Nate did.
He wasn't the only one
dropping things out there. The
Injuns fumbled six times, and
managed to get only two of them
back. The strangest episode was
when Jim Kauffman, Superfrosh
two years ago, outran his blockers
on a kick return and collided with
one of them, dropping the ball.
And then there were those two
unfortunate slips on defense —the
first when Frank Slaton slipped
down the left sideline on a kickoff
return and went 98 yards for a
score, without a red shirt coming
within shouting distance; and the
second when the diminutive
flanker, Larry Merlini, slipped
through about a dozen Injun
hands and charged 20 yards up
the middle for a TD.
If the sloppiness is cleared up,
the Impossible Dream may be
realized.
Things should be a little more
interesting tomorrow when
Oregon comes to town. At least

the Band should be back, and the
new cheerleaders (Right On!) And
there won't be that strange crew
that showed up from SJS. A few
of them were merrily blowing
whistles and confusing the
referees on the field (the players
managed to survive—the refs are a
bit denser).
And then there was this one
cheerleader, shouting like his
audience was totally deaf and
banging madly at every drum in
sight. Eventually his fellows
restrained him.
Unfortunately for Spartan
fans, their team was unable to
restrain the Big Red.
For some strange reason,
Stanford decided to play a
football game this year before
anyone was on campus besides the
football players.
So on Saturday, September 20,
the Injuns gaily marched out onto
the Stanford Stadium turf to
massacre their arch-victims, the
San Jose State Spartans.
Somehow, 31,000 souls turned
up for the annual sacrificial ritual.
It is questionable how many
students were there from the
Farm (San Jose was out in
force—more on that later). It was
so early even the omnipresent
Leland Stanford Junior (pause)
University Marching Band hadn't
arrived yet. A group of would-be
musicians from Menlo-Atherton
High School acted as a noble (but
not quite sufficient) replacement.
Actually, it turned out there
was very little reason to attend
the game. It was almost a
complete rerun of last year's
morality play (Stanford=Good —in
the platonic sense; San Jose=Evil;
Good conquers Evil).
Rawboned Jim Plunkett, the
man on whom the Athletic
Department is spending several
thou in promoting him for
All-American, led the squad up
and down the neatly manicured
greensward, completing his aerials
almost at will (13 of 15, not a bad
percentage).
Don Bruce, the man who
would be a starting quarterback at
any other school on the Coast,
and almost anywhere else in the
nation, then took his turn as high
priest at the sacrifice, and after a
slow start, lived up to his
reputation.
And then, to make the brilliant
afternoon complete, little Ron
Fujikawa, the only Japanese
quarterback in college football,
made his semi-annual appearance
(San Jose State games, plus the
last three minutes of the Cal
game, only) as leader of the Big
Red.
With the entire Stanford bench
on their feet cheering him, Fuji
led the team to a touchdown, on a
10-yard pass to transplanted
hurdler Rick Tipton. As a matter
of fact, Fuji threw two beautiful
strikes to Rick on the touchdown

drive. Fujikawa to Tipton. Ah, it
has a lyrical ring. Almost enough
to make you forget Plunkett to
Washington (Gene last year,
Demea this go-round).
But don't start smelling roses
quite yet. It began this way last
year —and then there was
Southern Cal. Or, to be exact,
there wasn't Shoemaker. When
the placement specialist got
injured last year, Steve Horowitz
was suddenly pressed into service.
A fine linebacker, Steve's only
kicking experience was an
occasional extra point in high
school.
Those three missed field goals
in the 27-24 loss to SC were
enough to make John Ralston cry.
After that disheartening defeat,
the team went downhill for three
weeks before coming back to take
its last three in a row.

greensward, completing his aerials
almost at will (13 of 15, not a bad
percentage).
Don Bruce, the man who
would be a starting quarterback at
any other school on the Coast,
and almost anywhere else in the
nation, then took his turn as high
priest at the sacrifice, and after a
slow start, lived up to his
reputation.
And then, to make the brilliant
afternoon complete, little Ron
Fujikawa, the only Japanese
quarterback in college football,
made his semi-annual appearance
(San Jose State games, plus the
last three minutes of the Cal
game, only) as leader of the Big
Red.
With the entire Stanford bench
on their feet cheering him, Fuji
led the team to a touchdown, on a
10-yard pass to transplanted
hurdler Rick Tipton. As a matter
of fact, Fuji threw two beautiful
strikes to Rick on the touchdown

drive. Fujikawa to Tipton. Ah, it
has a lyrical ring. Almost enough
to make you forget Plunkett to
Washington (Gene last year,
Demea this go-round).
But don't start smelling roses
quite yet. It began this way last
year —and then there was
Southern Cal. Or, to be exact,
there wasn't Shoemaker. When
the placement specialist got
injured last year, Steve Horowitz
was suddenly pressed into service.
A fine linebacker, Steve's only
kicking experience was an
occasional extra point in high
school.
Those three missed field goals
in the 27-24 loss to SC were
enough to make John Ralston cry.
After that disheartening defeat,
the team went downhill for three
weeks before coming back to take
its last three in a row.
There are still problems,
however. Hillary Shockloy didn't
look like a third-string fullback
out there. In fact, he was very
reminiscent of Nate
Kirtman—unfortunately in more
ways than one.
Not only did Shockley display
the same hard-driving power that
Nate always showed, he seemed to
have the same sad tendency to
drop the ball at inoportune
moments, just as Nate did.
He wasn't the only one
dropping things out there. The
Injuns fumbled six times, and
managed to get only two of them
back. The strangest episode was
when Jim Kauffman, Superfrosh
two years ago, outran his blockers
on a kick return and collided with
one of them, dropping the ball.
And then there were those two
unfortunate slips on defense —the
first when Frank Slaton slipped
down the left sideline on a kickoff
return and went 98 yards for a
score, without a red shirt coming
within shouting distance; and the
second when the diminutive
flanker, Larry Merlini, slipped
through about a dozen Injun
hands and charged 20 yards up
the middle for a TD.
If the sloppiness is cleared up,
the Impossible Dream may be
realized.
Things should be a little more
interesting tomorrow when
Oregon comes to town. At least

the Band should be back, and the
new cheerleaders (Right On!) And
there won't be that strange crew
that showed up from SJS. A few
of them were merrily blowing
whistles and confusing the
referees on the field (the players
managed to survive—the refs are a
bit denser).
And then there was this one
cheerleader, shouting like his
audience was totally deaf and
banging madly at every drum in
sight. Eventually his fellows
restrained him.
Unfortunately for Spartan
fans, their team was unable to
restrain the Big Red.
