### 
(First of a six part series)
Oregon's improved Ducks have
been rated by all the experts as
the dark horse candidate in this
year's race for the roses. This
year's squad has two big
advantages over last season's 4-6
edition: the schedule (they face
only five conference opponents,
skipping USC, and California) and
a sophomore slotback named
Bobby Moore.
Tabbed as one of the top sophs
in the country, Moore made an
impressive debut last week,
catching three TD passes in
Oregon's 28-17 win over Utah.
Moore and Bob Newland lead a
fine receiving corps, but the
Ducks need someone to throw the
ball to them. Injury-plagued Tom
Blanchard tossed three scoring
bombs last week and may be their
answer, but the junior has seen
action in only three college games.
Tailback Rocky Pamplin
rushed for 150 yards versus Utah,
but may be lost with an ankle
injury. The offensive line is
untested. The defensive line and
backers were hurt by graduation,
but the econdary is very strong.
The Duel hope to make up for
defensive holes by springing
Moore on deep pass patterns.
They could be an explosive,
high-scoring team.
Predicted finish: 4th place.
