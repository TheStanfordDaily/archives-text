Another school year begins.
Like last year and undoubtedly
like the years to come, it will be a
traumatic time for students and
the nation in general. Tempers
will be short, students will be
unhappy, and problems will go
unresolved. Violence is bound to
erupt.
Such are the changing times of
today. The college campus moves
quickly, and attempts to involve
itself with the troubles of the
"real world." Yet a part of college
life goes on regardless of wars,
riots, sit-ins, and protests. A group
of students remain unaffected by
such goings-on (at least from
August to December). They are a
minority group to be sure, but
hardly a downtrodden one. In fact
at most schools they receive more
attention than SDS chapters.
In this time of involvement
how can they possibly remain
immune from the chaos and
pressure of the times yet still
attract sympathetic admirers by
the tens of thousands? The answer
is simple: they stage their own
kind of violence. An organized,
stable brand acceptable to the
masses. The battle-ground is a
stadium rather than Harvard Yard
or SRI, the opponents are more or
less evenly matched (and all have
the same equipment), and
sentiment is evenly divided
between the two fighters. One
may be dressed in red and the
other in blue, but one group is
just as American as the other;
they are strong, big, straight, and
clean-shaven.
But they are more than just a
group of 77 tough men. Football
players are an important part of
the university. If they are skilled
and exciting, people turn out to
see them play. Tickets go out, the
money comes in, and the
institution comes out on top.
Athletic grants and scholarships
are questioned by some, but at
many schools the money is more
than made up for on the playing
field. Schools feed their athletic
departments, and the sports
programs hope to make it a good
investment for their schools.
College football, the backbone
of every school's sports program is
celebrating its 100 th birthday this
year, and warriors from some 300
colleges and universities are out to
put on a good show as well as rake
in a little cash.
Since their 10-6 win over
Hopkins Academy in 1892,
Stanford University has amassed a
total of 426 wins, 222 losses, and

43 ties. With this year's season
already underway, and high hopes
for the balance of the campaign,
the football squad will attempt to
make this birthday year a private
party for the Big Red. Ranked by
everyone as one of the top 20
teams in the nation, Coach John
Ralston's men will open their run
for the Rose Bowl tomorrow at
1 :30 p.m. when their Pacific-8
season begins against the Oregon
Ducks.
If excitement is the real
drawing power in football,
Stanford should be rolling in the
green stuff. The Indians continue
to display a fast-paced aerial
offense with Plunkett and Bunce
throwing the bombs. In their first
1969 performance, The Tribe
showed great potential against the
hapless San Jose State Spartans.
There were fumbles and penalties
and even a fight, but for a first
game, it was not a bad show. It is
often difficult to show your best
stuff against an inept opposition,
and the tendency is to get as
sloppy as the losers. The mistakes
must vanish tomorrow, because
Oregon is fielding their best team
in many years(see scouting report,
page 10).
The odds-makers see Stanford
by 10 points, but Coach Ralston
has said he will be happy with a
one-point win, and he has a point.

Except for last year's 28-12 win,
the Injun-Duck series has been
amazingly close. From '64
through '67, Stanford won three
games by a total of eight points,
and lost the '66 encounter, 7-3.
With the strength of Plunkett's
arm, and the muscle of Don Parish
and Pat Preston stopping the
Oregon running game, I call
Stanford a winner by two
touchdowns. The Tribe is strong.
With only knee injuries to
defensive man Tom Sones and
improved placekicker Steve
Horowitz, the team is healthy for
the first of a number of rugged
games.
So for the present, football
takes center stage. Tomorrow
45,000 people will be thinking of
Plunkett and Parish rather than
Pitzer and Pugh. If the team lives
up to its potential, touchdowns
may share the headlines with
Trustees. Maybe not. Passes are
filling the Stanford air, not tear
gas, and the violence stops on a
whistle. It's a nice switch. Come
watch the war.


THE CHIEF CHIEF—Stan lord's leader Jim Plunkett has been named by
everyone as the top quarterback in the west, and one of the nation's best. A
pre season All-America choice, Jim leads the Tribe against Oregon tomorrow at
1:30 p.m. in Stanford Stadium as l'ac-8 play begins.
