# Senate Revamps Committee Setup
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
The Faculty Senate yesterday
took a major step toward stream
lining the University's tangled
committee structure. The chief
faculty decision-making body ap
proved in principle a committee
re-organization into four types; it
ratified more specific directives
for three standing committees in
the new structure.
Senate Chairman William
Clebsch rated the restructuring
proposal as the most basic change
enacted. Also, by accepting
specific plans for the Undergradu
ate Studies Committee, the Senate
established a mechanism for imp
lementing several key proposals
from the Study of Education at
Stanford (SES).
The Undergraduate Studies
Committee will replace three
current committees—General
Studies, Undergraduate Education
and Registrar's Advisory Commit
tee.
Directives for Committees on
Research and on Awards, Prizes
and Honors were also adopted.
Under the new structure, these
two and the Undergraduate
Studies Committee fall into the
Academic Council committee
category. Primary responsibility
for appointing members and
acting on recommendations lies
with he Academic Council or its
Faculty Senate.
Other Categories
Other types of standing com
mittees are: University commit
tees (with primary appointing
authority and responsibility for
action divided between faculty,
administration and students);
presidential committees (primarily
appointed by and responsible to
the president); and ASSU commit
tees (to deal with problems of
special interest to students.)
The reorganization proposal
adopted unanimously by voice
vote included recommendations
that students appointed through

ASSU procedures be given voting
positions on almost all commit
tees. It also advised that com
mittee membership be limited,
usually to nine to encourage
active participation.
Specific charges for committees
and the restructuring proposal
were reported from the Senate
Committee on Committees, which
consulted administrative officials,
committee chairmen and the
ASSU Council of Presidents in
extensive deliberations.
