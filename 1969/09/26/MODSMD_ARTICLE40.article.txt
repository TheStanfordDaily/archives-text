Stanford once again has a
serious housing shortage. This
year 480 students are living in the
new trailers, but many people,
mostly transfers and graduate
students, are having difficulty
finding reasonable housing.
Even though the housing office
sent a letter to most off-campus
housing units in the area asking
consideration for the problem,
rents still remain quite high,
leaving numerous open listings in
the Encina Hall files.
Fraternities are taking on
borders in numbers comparable to
last year, when the shortage was
acute. However, the Housing
Clearinghouse in Stern, after
placing over 200 students, closed
down early because too few
people came there for help.
Dan Williams, Assistant Dean of
Students for housing, thinks that
many students anticipated a short
age again and made living arrange
ments much earlier this year, thus
easing some of the problem.
