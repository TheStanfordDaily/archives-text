# Pitzer Agrees
## New Dean Proposed 
### 
The establishment of a new
administrative position at
Stanford University, a Dean of
Undergraduate Studies, was
recommended over the summer
by the Academic Senate.
Stanford President Kenneth S.
Pitzer expressed approval for this
strong new focus on
undergraduate education and said
he intends to proceed with steps
toward appointment of the new
dean.
A Study of Education at
Stanford (SES) report strongly
urged the establishment of the
new position. The report called
upon the new dean to have the
responsibility of "supporting and
maintaining what is good, aiding
the renovation of what is
inadequate, stimulating and
assisting educational innovation."
Prime Undcrgraduate Advocate
The SES report said the Dean
of Undergraduate Studies "should
become the university's prime
advocate for the interests of
undergraduate education in its
academic or curricular aspect,
with special emphasis on its
development and renewal."

Non-academic aspects remain
under the jurisdiction of the Dean
of Students.
In their action, taken without
dissent, the faculty also endorsed
an SES recommendation for a
new Committee of Undergraduate
Studies, and abolished two
present committees on
Undergraduate Education and
General Studies.
The new dean will report
directly to the provost, the
faculty decided, in agreement
with the SES recommendation.
Develop New Courses
The dean and the new
committee, the Senate said, are
"specifically charged with
responsibility for working with
departments to develop new
course offerings primarily
intended for non-specialists."
Among the SES report's
suggestions for innovations were:
• Science and technology for the
non-specialist, where "such
problems as reducing

environmental pollution and
improving mass transportation
afford fruitful themes for
demonstrating the interplay of
technological skill and social need.
The gap between what we know
how to do technically and what
we are able to do socially calls for
careful analysis rather than
existential despair."
• Interdisciplinary studies in the
social sciences, with, for example,
a course relating "what social
scientists know and do not know
to social problems like urban
poverty, racism, and crime."
• Interdisciplinary studies in the
humanities, such as "programs in
Modern Thought and Literature
and in Contemporary Culture,
drawing not only on literature but
also upon the other creative arts
and upon those forces in
contemporary thought that shape
the modern consciousness."
