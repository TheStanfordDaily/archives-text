### 
Robert D. Cory and Ronald M.
Oster, have been honored for
outstanding work in Stanford's
75-year-old debate program.
Cory and Oster were chosen
from among 200 active members
of the debate squad to receive the
Mellinkoff Award, established by
Mr. and Mrs. Albert Mellinkoff of
San Francisco. The award is
Stanford's highest honor in the
forensics piogram.
During the past school year
Cory and Oster won debate
tournaments at the University of
Wyoming, Lewis and Clark
University, Stanford, and the
American University in
Washington, D.C. At the
American University tournament
Cory was named outstanding
individual speaker and Oster
received the third place award. At
the Lewis and Clark tournament
they reversed the order with Oster
being named outstanding
individual speaker and Cory
receiving the runner-up trophy.
The two debators also won
second place at a tournament
sponsored by Caltech in Pasadena.
Both students are majoring in
political science and have just
completed their junior year. Oster
is chairman of the Stanford
Debate Council and Cory was
runner up in the recent election
for student body president.
