# Recent Grads, Older Alumni, Professors To Join Board
## 
### 
Under pressure from the uni
versity community, Stanford's
Board of Trustees will diversify its
membership, hoping to make the
university's governing board
"more representative of con
temporary society."
The trustees, currently a
23-man self-perpetuating body,
voted over the summer to enlarge
their ranks, aiding faculty mem
bers from other institutions,
young Stanford alumni, and older
alumni to the board. They also
invited Stanford faculty and stu
dents to serve as voting members
of most trustee committees.
The move by the trustees is
expected—and some say de
signed—to take the edge off
campus discontent over university
governance policies. Campus ele
ments btirred up a heated cam
paign against the trustees last
year, charging that the board was
a homogeneous body composed
of wealthy and powerful corpor
ate leaders.
As announced by University
President Kenneth Pitzer to the
Faculty Senate last week, the
trustee reforms shape up as
follows:
First, two vacancies on the
board will be filled by faculty
members from other institutions.
An informal student and faculty
committee reportedly began to
make recommendations to the
board on possible faculty repre
sentatives last spring. Announce
ment of the selection of the two

new trustees is expected in a
month or so.
Two Resignations
The two vacancies resulted
from the resignations of two
regular trustees earlier this month.
They were Dean Watkins, Palo
Alto electronics executive, and
Edmund Littlefield, San Francisco
business executive, both con
demned by campus activists for
their industrial and military inter
ests.
An earlier vacancy caused by
the appointment of trustee David
Packard to a high government
post will be filled by the board
under present appointment pro
cedures.
Second, the board will be
expanded from 23 to 32 mem
bers. Nine resulting new positions
will be filled by four recent
Stanford graduates who must be
under 35 years of age, four older
alumni, and the University presi
dent, who will have voting mem
bership for the first time.
The university must seek court
approval in order to enlarge the
board from its present size, but
few legal problems are expected.
The eight new alumni trustees,
who must have a formal degree
from the University, will be
elected by direct vote of the
alumni. Only two new members
from each age group will be
elected this year. They will serve
three and fcur-year terms, respec
tively, depending on their ranking
by the voters.

Thereafter, one new member
will be elected annually for a
four-year, non-renewable term.
Within three years from the time
the plan goes into effect, all 32
positions will be filled and all
eight alumni will be serving
four-year, staggered terms.
In an interview with The Daily
last week, President Pitzer ex
plained that a nominating com
mittee will be selected to suggest
two nominees for each position to
then be presented to alumni
voters. A petitioning process will
also be available for additional
nominations.
Alumni Nominating Committee
Pitzer said that the Stanford
Alumni Association will probably
select the members of the nomin
ating committee. He added that
Stanford Associates, a group fo
alumni and friends of the uni
versity who raise money for
Stanford, will most likely also be
involved in the nominating
process.
Pitzer made it clear that the
four under-35 trustees should
include "the younger group whose
formal education is recently com
pleted. I hope they won't all be
34 years and 9 months. He added
that election to the alumni posts
may be by class year rather than
strictly by age.
The age 35 dividing line was "a
compromise," according to Pitzer.
"It was as low a figure they could
logically approve," he noted,
without creating widely dispro
portionate groups. Even the
35-year line leaves three-fifths of
the alumni in the older age group.
Third, students and faculty will
serve with vote on most trustee
committees; court approval is not
needed for this move, and com
mittee members should be select
ed swiftly through regular student
and faculty nominating pro
cedures.
Five Committees
Students and faculty will be
members of the following stand
ing committees: academic affairs;
building and grounds; finance;
land development; and planning
and development. In addition,
faculty members will serve on two
other committees, for investments
and trustee nominations.
Pitzer claimed that although
students would be barred as
regular members from the two

committees, a student input will
be a regular part of the trustee
selection process. He did not
comment on the student role in
the investment committee.
No more than two students and
two faculty members, with the
rank of assistant professor or
higher, will serve on any com
mittee. Students will be selected
by the Student Senate Nomin
ating Committee, while faculty
are selected by the Faculty
Senate's COmmittee on Com
mittees. Both are subject to
approval by the university presi
dent and the board of trustees.
In commenting on the trustee
reforms, most students seemed to
accept the changes as a good-faith
action by the board. Many acti
vists view the move as a token
gesture, barely scraping the sur
face of needed campus reforms.
"They've taken the lid off the
jar," a radical student commented
earlier this week.
Pat Shea of the Council of
Presidents calls the trustee shift,
"a sincere effort to change,
though too long delayed." Says
Shea, "If these changes had been
over the course of the past
decade, the trustees would have
had a far better grasp of campus
concerns than they will gain by a
rapid, dramatic alteration."
Procedures Unclear
Shea notes that specific pro
cedures for election of the four
recent alumni remain unclear and
hopes ground rules will promote a
balanced slate rather opening
slots for rich and well known
alumni.
President Pitzer apparently
feels that the trustee action will
satisfy most student demands for
reform: "I hope that these recent
announcements will make it clear
that there are means within the
existing framework for having
one's voice heard. The mecha
nisms for change are present."
"If people insist on pushing for
change without convincing others,
they will be restricted by the
majority," he added, sounding a
warning to campus leftists who
might become a "coercive minor
ity."
Pitzer applauded the decision
to give increasing responsibility to
alumni in university decision
making. He sees alumni as "inde
