# Dailites!

### 
We missed you.
It's understandable you might
forget our face, hut everyone
knows our name. We're community
property.
It's tough to work without
friends. We may only look like
paper and ink, but we have feelings
too.
So if you want to make us
happy, come visit us. And work
with us. Old and new DAILY
peopleâ€”please come help us. We're
having an introductory meeting for
new students on Monday at 4 p.m.
in THE DAILY office.
It's just not right to put out a
newspaper alone.
