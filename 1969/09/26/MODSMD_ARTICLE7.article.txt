# At Freshman Convocation
## Pitzer Hits Nixon, Viet War 
### MICHAEL KUHL 
"Recent moves to withdraw
troops (from Vietnam) and reduce
draft calls are... so far inade
quate," Stanford President
Kenneth S. Pitzer told students
attending the freshman con
vocation Wednesday night.
In voicing his "personal
opinions," Pitzer told his first
entering freshman class that Presi
dent Nixon "has had more than
enough time to plan (his) course."
He also lashed out at the Chief
Executive for not making those
draft reforms allowed under the
current law.
The annual pre-reg affair saw
sandal-clad Pat Shea, member of
the ASSU Council of Presidents,
and Sociology Prof. Sanford
Dornbusch encourage the class of
1973 to sceptically evaluate their
University experience.
While acknowledging tha
national problems are "the more
fundamental," Pitzer spent, a great
deal of his time documenting
student involvement in planning
and the resultant changes within
the University.

"There is no justification for
coercive tactics or for actions
which infringe on the right of
others in seeking change within
the university," he concluded.
"Creative Restlessness"
Characterizing the Stanford at
mosphere as one of "creative
restlessness," Pitzer laid out the
ideal balance between "the intel
lectual heritage of mankind" and
dissent.
He cautioned his audience
worried about the slow pace of
change to realize that all proposals
need a "board base of students,
faculty, and staff support . . .
(for) any lasting impact on this
campus (and to attract) the
financial help needed ..."
However, Pil/.er drew his most
enthusiastic response when he
told students "where I stand
personally and the direction in
which my personal influence will
be aimed."
Applause interrupted his sharp
criticism first made public last
April, that ''it is a violation of
human rights to draft a young
man to fight a war which he

regards as grossly immoral and
about which the nation is
unsure."
Turning to the problems of
race, poverty, and ecology, Pitzer
blamed the public's lack of
confidence on "the sense of
failure of past policies to solve
th problemsâ€”policies which
were hailed at the time they were
initiated as progressive and wise.
But we . . . need new national
policies, and 1 hope you will also
seek at Stanford that depth of
understanding and breadth of
knowledge from which new and
improved national policies might
arise," he added.
Not As Good
Dornbusch told the Frost
Amphitheater crowd that "Stan
ford never was and never will be
as good as you hope."
"Don't be surprised when you
have some crummy courses or
even meet some dumb students,"
he said.
He suggested that disenchant
ment with the Stanford edu
cational process is a "function of
'he lack of zestful independent

study." Dornbusch added that
"some of the best courses at
Stanford are locked up in the
library at night."
"It's the diploma that the
world rewards," Dornbusch
noted. Since admittance to Stan
ford almost signifies a diploma, he
suggested that students should
turn their attentions to the
"active process" of education.
"The University may be a
community of scholars, but it
isn't a solidary moral community.
Its heterogeneity provides an
opportunity to try on several
selves to decide what kind of
person you want to be," he said.
Shea, one of four ASSU Presi
dents who must grapple with the
University administration, called
Stanford an "expanding and con
tracting unit."
He encouraged freshman to
take everything they heard with a
grai of salt, not by espousing
cynicism, but by adding a sense of
humor to social and intellectual
criticism.
