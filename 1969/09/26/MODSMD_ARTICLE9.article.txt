# Dear Mom
## Mom's Welcome 
### Cissie Bonini 
Welcome! Welcome to all you
dear freshmen and transfers. And
a special greeting to all you
freshmen women who missed out
on Prince to n—you may not find a
tiger in your tank, dears, but there
is an Indian under every bed.
Stanford has a very special
heritage which will soon be made
manifest to you. Some statistics
that may interest you are:
1) 65% of this year's
entering class are named
Snyder, which, surprisingly,
is also the surname of the
former Director of
Admissions.
2) The political system—We
pride ourselves at Stanford

on being completely
open-minded. You may be
of any political persuasion
whatsoever . . .just so long
as you're radical.
3) The Honor Code at
Stanford enables a true
system of sharing and
helpfulness among the
student body.
4) Acne—Stanford women
have the nicest complexions
in California, thanks to their
thoughtful physicians who
recommend the pill for
acne.
5) The Daily is an
ultra-conservative right-wing
newspaper which is named

for Mayor Daley of Chicago.
We take great pride in our new
president, Dr. Pitzer, who was
formerly president of Barley
University in Texas. We also have
many student body
presidents —almost anyone you
talk to is one. ("Student Body
President" looks good on your
graduate school application.)
Here at Stanford, we have an
intricate system of abbreviations
and definitions which may be
confusing to a new student.
Mother has compiled a partial list
to help you through the maze:
JANE: Mrs. Stanford. Tarzan.
course, was Senator Stanford.
KENNETH:
JANE: Mrs. Stanford. Tarzan,
of course, was Senator Stanford.
KENNETH: Well-known New
York hair stylist.
MEM MUCK: Trailer park
during the rainy season.
COWELL HEALTH CENTER:
All sick people are treated in one
of two ways: you are either (1)
immunized to go overseas or (2)
given a bottle of tranquillizers and
an appointment in a week with a
psychiatrist. (In cases involving
broken bones or arterial bleeding,
you get an appointment with the
psychiatrist in four days and a
laxative.)
MEM CLAW: Fountain in
White Plaza. It was sculpted by
Smoky the Bear and its official
name is "Forest—After the Fire."
SADDLE SORE: Statue in
front of the new Art Building,
near the Library. Also called
"Decayed Wisdom Tooth" or
"Mem Fang".
MEM'S ROOM: Where you go
if you feel self-conscious in the
Ladies' Room.
S.D.S.: This group is easy to
get into and has a lot of
interesting activities. You will
have an arresting time with them.
Do write home to Mom and
Daddy that you're active in the
S.D.S.
THE BOOKSTORE: This is
called the Bookstore because it
was un-MEM-tionable.
FACULTY WOMEN'S CLUB
EMBROIDERY GROUP: Real
center of decision-making at the
University. They are presently
knitting the names of the
suspended students into a long
French scarf.
If you run into any difficulties
or have any questions whatsoever,
just write to "MOM" c/o The
Daily. Meanwhile, wear your
skirts two inches below the knee,
dears, and read Norman Vincent
Peale daily!
