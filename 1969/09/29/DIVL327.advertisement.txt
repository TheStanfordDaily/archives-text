I Welcome
We're sure you're all eager to get back to the books
I and the long hours of studying.
And while we take our tongue out of our cheek give
I a thought to music to study by. Lafayette has a wide
I selection of AM/FM radios to lighten your work.
Take em anywhere— we have models powered by
■ battery, AC, or both.
See us, too, for stereo radios, phonos, and compact
I combinations, for tape recorders and supplies.
Recording tape and popular cassettes are sold at
I WHOLESALE prices at Lafayette.
For all your electronic needs, remember Lafayette—
your wholesale department store of electronics!
