# Coalition Fights Coyote Hill Development
## 
### DAVID JONES 
Stanford's plan for leasing and
light industrial development of
university-owned foothill land
near Coyote Hill passed its last
administrative hurdle in
mid-September with approval
from the Palo Alto City Council.
Foothill development has been
hotly contested by
conservationists, low cost housing
advocates and residents in Los
Altos Hills where strict zoning
keeps homes at one-per-acre
density.
The University development
plan calls for nine-parcel division
of the Stanford acreage southwest
of campus bounded by Page Mill
and Arastradero Roads, the
Foothill Expressway and Hillview
Avenue.
The lot division and light
industrial use have been approved
by the Palo Alto Planning
Department, and the city's
Elective Planning Commission and
City Council.
The University has planned
light industry for the foothill area
under the Stanford development
masterplan since 1951 states

Smith.
Prospective Lessors
Prospective lessors include

Syntex Laboratories, Computer
Time Sharing Corporation, an
East Coast computer education
firm, and the Opto Electronics
division of Fairchild.
Opto would lease the largest
parcel, 25.3 acres, on the
provision that 7.8 acres would be
used for the development of a golf
course.
Syntex will lease the area
northwest of Coyote Hilltop for
an animal research center.
Coyote Hilltop will be
designated as Academic Reserve
and used as open-space grazing
land for animals in a joint Medical
School-Syntex research project on
birth control and animal behavior.
Stanford real estate spokesman
Smith notes that the construction
will have to meet demanding
University standards for beauty,
design, and topographical
compatibility. He added that
construction will be held to 20
per cent of the land to guarantee
open space and that landscaping
will be required on a minimum of
30 per cent of the leased acreage.
The conservationist Committee
for Green Foothills calls for
keeping Coyote Hill as a
wilderness park. They argue that
Stanford should declare a
moratorium on foothill

development until Palo Alto has
completed a preliminary gloss of
its new comprehensive foothill
development plan, due in 1970. In
return, the University would be
allowed to develop the present
industrial park at a greater
density.
Moratorium Opposed
Stanford opposes the
moratorium. B.F. Smith
emphasizes that Stanford is
proceeding under city-approved,
referendum-ratified zoning
ordiances which have long
designated Coyote Hill LM-5
(Light Industrial, five-acre
minimum parcels).
He also notes that Palo Alto's
City Council defeated a
moratorium vote earlier this year.
Opponents respond that the
city council operates from
Stanford's vest pocket and charge
that the close (4-3) city-wide
zoning referendum was won with
Stanford publicity dollars.
Traffic Congestion Feared
Los Altos Hills residents take a
different tack. They argue that
development and traffic
congestion will change the tone
and atmosphere of their
community with its one-acre,
ranch-style estates.
The residents also claim that

Stanford agreed that its
development would not extend
west of Foothill Expressway. The
University denies making any
formal or informal agreements.
Ruad Dispute
The residents have joined in
battle on the widening of
Arastradero Road from two to
four lanes. They cite traffic
projections for 1990 that indicate
daily vehicle, volume from the
industrial park will reach 17,000
at Foothill and Arastradero and
76 at Arastradero and Page Mill
near the Junipero Serra
interchange.
The residents say that
congestion argues against
industrial development. The Palo
Alto planning office says this
necessitates four lanes and that
they will procede unilaterally if
necessary.
However, last week a private
meeting between Los Altos Hills
mayor Ross Aiken and Smith
concluded with an agreement by
the University to embark on an
extensive tree-planting program
on a 250 foot setback strip along
Arastradero Road. This new
arrangement should considerably
placate the unhappy Los Altos

Hills residents.
Already two roads have been
knifed across Coyote Hill. The
road bed cut, says Smith, is
shallow and broad to allow
maximum refoliation. The
Conservationists despair that the
roads have already scarred Coyote
Hill's most outstanding
topographic features—Deer Creek
and Deer Gulch.
Housing Squeeze
Low-cost housing advocates
argue that further industrial park
development will only add to the
mid-peninsula housing squeeze.
The median salary of industrial
park employees is $9100. Yet
housing in Palo Alto is, for the
most part, compatible with an
annual salary of $12-13,000. The
result, low-cost housing advocates
say, is that housing prices are
inflated by increased demand and
low-income families, particularly
minorities, are frozen out of the
Palo Alto housing market as
industrial park workers snap up
the few available lower cost units.
The University is currently
undertaking a feasibility study of
low-income, s bsidized housing
on University land. Last June the
Trustees authorized "urgent

exploration" of a possible site for
low and moderate income rental
housing on University lands.
Low-Cost Housing Problem
Smith emphasizes, however,
that the University's tax-exempt
status demands that it keep out of
the development business itself.
"We have to convince a
developer," Smith says, "to come
in and put his money into that
kind of development."
Low-cost housing advocates
respond that housing costs in
northern Santa Clara County have
risen 55 per cent while the cost of
living index in the Bay Area has
risen only 20 per cent. They argue
that Stanford, as the county's
largest landowner has a
responsibility to solve rather than
irritate the housing shortage, as
they say it has done in the past.
Other Benefits Explained
The University emphasizes that
foothill development is hardly a
one-sided issue. The proposed
development, University
spokesmen say, will add close to a
million dollars to the city, county
and school district tax rolls.
Syntex's present industrial
park facility last year, for
example, contributed $500,000 to

city and county tax rolls and the
company made local purchases of
$5 million.
The University, Smith says, is
badly in need of untied funds in
its general fund. The 51-year
University leases of Coyote Hill
will net the University a predicted
lump sum amount of $4 million.
At an investment rate of six per
cent, Smith says, that will mean
$240,000 for annual operating
expenses.
Opponents say that $240,000
is less than .25 per cent of the
University's budget-hardly worth
sacrificing the foothills. Smith
responds with a rhetorical
question: "How do you get
people to contribute to the
memorial road fund or the
memorial cut the grass fund or the
memorial power and light fund."
Smith further emphasizes that
property taxes on the lands make
them prohibitively expensive to
maintain undeveloped.
Conservationists reply that
"greenbelt zoning," a
committment to keep land in
farming for a ten-year period,
removes land from the tax rolls
without industrial development.

Stanford should declare a
moratorium on foothill

development until Palo Alto has
completed a preliminary gloss of
its new comprehensive foothill
development plan, due in 1970. In
return, the University would be
allowed to develop the present
industrial park at a greater
density.
Moratorium Opposed
Stanford opposes the
moratorium. B.F. Smith
emphasizes that Stanford is
proceeding under city-approved,
referendum-ratified zoning
ordiances which have long
designated Coyote Hill LM-5
(Light Industrial, five-acre
minimum parcels).
He also notes that Palo Alto's
City Council defeated a
moratorium vote earlier this year.
Opponents respond that the
city council operates from
Stanford's vest pocket and charge
that the close (4-3) city-wide
zoning referendum was won with
Stanford publicity dollars.
Traffic Congestion Feared
Los Altos Hills residents take a
different tack. They argue that
development and traffic
congestion will change the tone
and atmosphere of their
community with its one-acre,
ranch-style estates.
The residents also claim that

Stanford agreed that its
development would not extend
west of Foothill Expressway. The
University denies making any
formal or informal agreements.
Ruad Dispute
The residents have joined in
battle on the widening of
Arastradero Road from two to
four lanes. They cite traffic
projections for 1990 that indicate
daily vehicle, volume from the
industrial park will reach 17,000
at Foothill and Arastradero and
76 at Arastradero and Page Mill
near the Junipero Serra
interchange.
The residents say that
congestion argues against
industrial development. The Palo
Alto planning office says this
necessitates four lanes and that
they will procede unilaterally if
necessary.
However, last week a private
meeting between Los Altos Hills
mayor Ross Aiken and Smith
concluded with an agreement by
the University to embark on an
extensive tree-planting program
on a 250 foot setback strip along
Arastradero Road. This new
arrangement should considerably
placate the unhappy Los Altos

Hills residents.
Already two roads have been
knifed across Coyote Hill. The
road bed cut, says Smith, is
shallow and broad to allow
maximum refoliation. The
Conservationists despair that the
roads have already scarred Coyote
Hill's most outstanding
topographic features—Deer Creek
and Deer Gulch.
Housing Squeeze
Low-cost housing advocates
argue that further industrial park
development will only add to the
mid-peninsula housing squeeze.
The median salary of industrial
park employees is $9100. Yet
housing in Palo Alto is, for the
most part, compatible with an
annual salary of $12-13,000. The
result, low-cost housing advocates
say, is that housing prices are
inflated by increased demand and
low-income families, particularly
minorities, are frozen out of the
Palo Alto housing market as
industrial park workers snap up
the few available lower cost units.
The University is currently
undertaking a feasibility study of
low-income, s bsidized housing
on University land. Last June the
Trustees authorized "urgent

exploration" of a possible site for
low and moderate income rental
housing on University lands.
Low-Cost Housing Problem
Smith emphasizes, however,
that the University's tax-exempt
status demands that it keep out of
the development business itself.
"We have to convince a
developer," Smith says, "to come
in and put his money into that
kind of development."
Low-cost housing advocates
respond that housing costs in
northern Santa Clara County have
risen 55 per cent while the cost of
living index in the Bay Area has
risen only 20 per cent. They argue
that Stanford, as the county's
largest landowner has a
responsibility to solve rather than
irritate the housing shortage, as
they say it has done in the past.
Other Benefits Explained
The University emphasizes that
foothill development is hardly a
one-sided issue. The proposed
development, University
spokesmen say, will add close to a
million dollars to the city, county
and school district tax rolls.
Syntex's present industrial
park facility last year, for
example, contributed $500,000 to

city and county tax rolls and the
company made local purchases of
$5 million.
The University, Smith says, is
badly in need of untied funds in
its general fund. The 51-year
University leases of Coyote Hill
will net the University a predicted
lump sum amount of $4 million.
At an investment rate of six per
cent, Smith says, that will mean
$240,000 for annual operating
expenses.
Opponents say that $240,000
is less than .25 per cent of the
University's budget-hardly worth
sacrificing the foothills. Smith
responds with a rhetorical
question: "How do you get
people to contribute to the
memorial road fund or the
memorial cut the grass fund or the
memorial power and light fund."
Smith further emphasizes that
property taxes on the lands make
them prohibitively expensive to
maintain undeveloped.
Conservationists reply that
"greenbelt zoning," a
committment to keep land in
farming for a ten-year period,
removes land from the tax rolls
without industrial development.


EARTH MOVING—This construction at Coyote Hill and a proposed light industrial development have drawn fire from
conservationists, advocates of low cost housing, and Los Altos Hills residents.
Stanford's plan for leasing and
light industrial development of
university-owned foothill land
near Coyote Hill passed its last
administrative hurdle in
mid-September with approval
from the Palo Alto City Council.
Foothill development has been
hotly contested by
conservationists, low cost housing
advocates and residents in Los
Altos Hills where strict zoning
keeps homes at one-per-acre
density.
The University development
plan calls for nine-parcel division
of the Stanford acreage southwest
of campus bounded by Page Mill
and Arastradero Roads, the
Foothill Expressway and Hillview
Avenue.
The lot division and light
industrial use have been approved
by the Palo Alto Planning
Department, and the city's
Elective Planning Commission and
City Council.
The University has planned
light industry for the foothill area
under the Stanford development
masterplan since 1951 states

Smith.
Prospective Lessors
Prospective lessors include

Syntex Laboratories, Computer
Time Sharing Corporation, an
East Coast computer education
firm, and the Opto Electronics
division of Fairchild.
Opto would lease the largest
parcel, 25.3 acres, on the
provision that 7.8 acres would be
used for the development of a golf
course.
Syntex will lease the area
northwest of Coyote Hilltop for
an animal research center.
Coyote Hilltop will be
designated as Academic Reserve
and used as open-space grazing
land for animals in a joint Medical
School-Syntex research project on
birth control and animal behavior.
Stanford real estate spokesman
Smith notes that the construction
will have to meet demanding
University standards for beauty,
design, and topographical
compatibility. He added that
construction will be held to 20
per cent of the land to guarantee
open space and that landscaping
will be required on a minimum of
30 per cent of the leased acreage.

Arastradero Road. This new
arrangement should considerably
placate the unhappy Los Altos

Hills residents.
Already two roads have been
knifed across Coyote Hill. The
road bed cut, says Smith, is
shallow and broad to allow
maximum refoliation. The
Conservationists despair that the
roads have already scarred Coyote
Hill's most outstanding
topographic features—Deer Creek
and Deer Gulch.
Housing Squeeze
Low-cost housing advocates
argue that further industrial park
development will only add to the
mid-peninsula housing squeeze.
The median salary of industrial
park employees is $9100. Yet
housing in Palo Alto is, for the
most part, compatible with an
annual salary of $12-13,000. The
result, low-cost housing advocates
say, is that housing prices are
inflated by increased demand and
low-income families, particularly
minorities, are frozen out of the
Palo Alto housing market as
industrial park workers snap up
the few available lower cost units.
The University is currently
undertaking a feasibility study of
low-income, s bsidized housing
on University land. Last June the
Trustees authorized "urgent

exploration" of a possible site for
low and moderate income rental
housing on University lands.
Low-Cost Housing Problem
Smith emphasizes, however,
that the University's tax-exempt
status demands that it keep out of
the development business itself.
"We have to convince a
developer," Smith says, "to come
in and put his money into that
kind of development."
Low-cost housing advocates
respond that housing costs in
northern Santa Clara County have
risen 55 per cent while the cost of
living index in the Bay Area has
risen only 20 per cent. They argue
that Stanford, as the county's
largest landowner has a
responsibility to solve rather than
irritate the housing shortage, as
they say it has done in the past.
Other Benefits Explained
The University emphasizes that
foothill development is hardly a
one-sided issue. The proposed
development, University
spokesmen say, will add close to a
million dollars to the city, county
and school district tax rolls.
Syntex's present industrial
park facility last year, for
example, contributed $500,000 to

city and county tax rolls and the
company made local purchases of
$5 million.
The University, Smith says, is
badly in need of untied funds in
its general fund. The 51-year
University leases of Coyote Hill
will net the University a predicted
lump sum amount of $4 million.
At an investment rate of six per
cent, Smith says, that will mean
$240,000 for annual operating
expenses.
Opponents say that $240,000
is less than .25 per cent of the
University's budget-hardly worth
sacrificing the foothills. Smith
responds with a rhetorical
question: "How do you get
people to contribute to the
memorial road fund or the
memorial cut the grass fund or the
memorial power and light fund."
Smith further emphasizes that
property taxes on the lands make
them prohibitively expensive to
maintain undeveloped.
Conservationists reply that
"greenbelt zoning," a
committment to keep land in
farming for a ten-year period,
removes land from the tax rolls
without industrial development.


EARTH MOVING—This construction at Coyote Hill and a proposed light industrial development have drawn fire from
conservationists, advocates of low cost housing, and Los Altos Hills residents.
Stanford's plan for leasing and
light industrial development of
university-owned foothill land
near Coyote Hill passed its last
administrative hurdle in
mid-September with approval
from the Palo Alto City Council.
Foothill development has been
hotly contested by
conservationists, low cost housing
advocates and residents in Los
Altos Hills where strict zoning
keeps homes at one-per-acre
density.
The University development
plan calls for nine-parcel division
of the Stanford acreage southwest
of campus bounded by Page Mill
and Arastradero Roads, the
Foothill Expressway and Hillview
Avenue.
The lot division and light
industrial use have been approved
by the Palo Alto Planning
Department, and the city's
Elective Planning Commission and
City Council.
The University has planned
light industry for the foothill area
under the Stanford development
masterplan since 1951 states
Stanford real estate manager Boyd
Smith.
Prospective Lessors
Prospective lessors include

Syntex Laboratories, Computer
Time Sharing Corporation, an
East Coast computer education
firm, and the Opto Electronics
division of Fairchild.
Opto would lease the largest
parcel, 25.3 acres, on the
provision that 7.8 acres would be
used for the development of a golf
course.
Syntex will lease the area
northwest of Coyote Hilltop for
an animal research center.
Coyote Hilltop will be
designated as Academic Reserve
and used as open-space grazing
land for animals in a joint Medical
School-Syntex research project on
birth control and animal behavior.
Stanford real estate spokesman
Smith notes that the construction
will have to meet demanding
University standards for beauty,
design, and topographical
compatibility. He added that
construction will be held to 20
per cent of the land to guarantee
open space and that landscaping
will be required on a minimum of
30 per cent of the leased acreage.
The conservationist Committee
for Green Foothills calls for
keeping Coyote Hill as a
wilderness park. They argue that
Stanford should declare a
moratorium on foothill

development until Palo Alto has
completed a preliminary gloss of
its new comprehensive foothill
development plan, due in 1970. In
return, the University would be
allowed to develop the present
industrial park at a greater
density.
Moratorium Opposed
Stanford opposes the
moratorium. B.F. Smith
emphasizes that Stanford is
proceeding under city-approved,
referendum-ratified zoning
ordiances which have long
designated Coyote Hill LM-5
(Light Industrial, five-acre
minimum parcels).
He also notes that Palo Alto's
City Council defeated a
moratorium vote earlier this year.
Opponents respond that the
city council operates from
Stanford's vest pocket and charge
that the close (4-3) city-wide
zoning referendum was won with
Stanford publicity dollars.
Traffic Congestion Feared
Los Altos Hills residents take a
different tack. They argue that
development and traffic
congestion will change the tone
and atmosphere of their
community with its one-acre,
ranch-style estates.
The residents also claim that

Stanford agreed that its
development would not extend
west of Foothill Expressway. The
University denies making any
formal or informal agreements.
Ruad Dispute
The residents have joined in
battle on the widening of
Arastradero Road from two to
four lanes. They cite traffic
projections for 1990 that indicate
daily vehicle, volume from the
industrial park will reach 17,000
at Foothill and Arastradero and
76 at Arastradero and Page Mill
near the Junipero Serra
interchange.
The residents say that
congestion argues against
industrial development. The Palo
Alto planning office says this
necessitates four lanes and that
they will procede unilaterally if
necessary.
However, last week a private
meeting between Los Altos Hills
mayor Ross Aiken and Smith
concluded with an agreement by
the University to embark on an
extensive tree-planting program
on a 250 foot setback strip along
Arastradero Road. This new
arrangement should considerably

one-sided issue. The proposed
development, University
spokesmen say, will add close to a
million dollars to the city, county
and school district tax rolls.
Syntex's present industrial
park facility last year, for
example, contributed $500,000 to

city and county tax rolls and the
company made local purchases of
$5 million.
The University, Smith says, is
badly in need of untied funds in
its general fund. The 51-year
University leases of Coyote Hill
will net the University a predicted
lump sum amount of $4 million.
At an investment rate of six per
cent, Smith says, that will mean
$240,000 for annual operating
expenses.
Opponents say that $240,000
is less than .25 per cent of the
University's budget-hardly worth
sacrificing the foothills. Smith
responds with a rhetorical
question: "How do you get
people to contribute to the
memorial road fund or the
memorial cut the grass fund or the
memorial power and light fund."
Smith further emphasizes that
property taxes on the lands make
them prohibitively expensive to
maintain undeveloped.
Conservationists reply that
"greenbelt zoning," a
committment to keep land in
farming for a ten-year period,
removes land from the tax rolls
without industrial development.


EARTH MOVING—This construction at Coyote Hill and a proposed light industrial development have drawn fire from
conservationists, advocates of low cost housing, and Los Altos Hills residents.
Stanford's plan for leasing and
light industrial development of
university-owned foothill land
near Coyote Hill passed its last
administrative hurdle in
mid-September with approval
from the Palo Alto City Council.
Foothill development has been
hotly contested by
conservationists, low cost housing
advocates and residents in Los
Altos Hills where strict zoning
keeps homes at one-per-acre
density.
The University development
plan calls for nine-parcel division
of the Stanford acreage southwest
of campus bounded by Page Mill
and Arastradero Roads, the
Foothill Expressway and Hillview
Avenue.
The lot division and light
industrial use have been approved
by the Palo Alto Planning
Department, and the city's
Elective Planning Commission and
City Council.
The University has planned
light industry for the foothill area
under the Stanford development
masterplan since 1951 states
Stanford real estate manager Boyd
Smith.
Prospective Lessors
Prospective lessors include

Syntex Laboratories, Computer
Time Sharing Corporation, an
East Coast computer education
firm, and the Opto Electronics
division of Fairchild.
Opto would lease the largest
parcel, 25.3 acres, on the
provision that 7.8 acres would be
used for the development of a golf
course.
Syntex will lease the area
northwest of Coyote Hilltop for
an animal research center.
Coyote Hilltop will be
designated as Academic Reserve
and used as open-space grazing
land for animals in a joint Medical
School-Syntex research project on
birth control and animal behavior.
Stanford real estate spokesman
Smith notes that the construction
will have to meet demanding
University standards for beauty,
design, and topographical
compatibility. He added that
construction will be held to 20
per cent of the land to guarantee
open space and that landscaping
will be required on a minimum of
30 per cent of the leased acreage.
The conservationist Committee
for Green Foothills calls for
keeping Coyote Hill as a
wilderness park. They argue that
Stanford should declare a
moratorium on foothill

development until Palo Alto has
completed a preliminary gloss of
its new comprehensive foothill
development plan, due in 1970. In
return, the University would be
allowed to develop the present
industrial park at a greater
density.
Moratorium Opposed
Stanford opposes the
moratorium. B.F. Smith
emphasizes that Stanford is
proceeding under city-approved,
referendum-ratified zoning
ordiances which have long
designated Coyote Hill LM-5
(Light Industrial, five-acre
minimum parcels).
He also notes that Palo Alto's
City Council defeated a
moratorium vote earlier this year.
Opponents respond that the
city council operates from
Stanford's vest pocket and charge
that the close (4-3) city-wide
zoning referendum was won with
Stanford publicity dollars.
Traffic Congestion Feared
Los Altos Hills residents take a
different tack. They argue that
development and traffic
congestion will change the tone
and atmosphere of their
community with its one-acre,
ranch-style estates.
The residents also claim that

Stanford agreed that its
development would not extend
west of Foothill Expressway. The
University denies making any
formal or informal agreements.
Ruad Dispute
The residents have joined in
battle on the widening of
Arastradero Road from two to
four lanes. They cite traffic
projections for 1990 that indicate
daily vehicle, volume from the
industrial park will reach 17,000
at Foothill and Arastradero and
76 at Arastradero and Page Mill
near the Junipero Serra
interchange.
The residents say that
congestion argues against
industrial development. The Palo
Alto planning office says this
necessitates four lanes and that
they will procede unilaterally if
necessary.
However, last week a private
meeting between Los Altos Hills
mayor Ross Aiken and Smith
concluded with an agreement by
the University to embark on an
extensive tree-planting program
on a 250 foot setback strip along
Arastradero Road. This new
arrangement should considerably
placate the unhappy Los Altos

Hills residents.
Already two roads have been
knifed across Coyote Hill. The
road bed cut, says Smith, is
shallow and broad to allow
maximum refoliation. The
Conservationists despair that the
roads have already scarred Coyote
Hill's most outstanding
topographic features—Deer Creek
and Deer Gulch.
Housing Squeeze
Low-cost housing advocates
argue that further industrial park
development will only add to the
mid-peninsula housing squeeze.
The median salary of industrial
park employees is $9100. Yet
housing in Palo Alto is, for the
most part, compatible with an
annual salary of $12-13,000. The
result, low-cost housing advocates
say, is that housing prices are
inflated by increased demand and
low-income families, particularly
minorities, are frozen out of the
Palo Alto housing market as
industrial park workers snap up
the few available lower cost units.
The University is currently
undertaking a feasibility study of
low-income, s bsidized housing
on University land. Last June the
Trustees authorized "urgent

exploration" of a possible site for
low and moderate income rental
housing on University lands.
Low-Cost Housing Problem
Smith emphasizes, however,
that the University's tax-exempt
status demands that it keep out of
the development business itself.
"We have to convince a
developer," Smith says, "to come
in and put his money into that
kind of development."
Low-cost housing advocates
respond that housing costs in
northern Santa Clara County have
risen 55 per cent while the cost of
living index in the Bay Area has
risen only 20 per cent. They argue
that Stanford, as the county's
largest landowner has a
responsibility to solve rather than
irritate the housing shortage, as
they say it has done in the past.

The University emphasizes that
foothill development is hardly a
one-sided issue. The proposed
development, University
spokesmen say, will add close to a
