## Note For Frosh 
### Jeff Kane 
"A note for freshmen on what
the catalogue doesn't tell, or
What to do when that new
Stanford T-shirt has been washed
a few times and is beginning to
fade."
The message is simple: now
that you're at Stanford, you can
do what you want to do; you can
be what you want to be, this time
around.
The message is simple: think;
use your head; dis cover your Self.
Before you turn in that class card,
remember: you can put down
whatever you want. Really. Who
do you want to be, this time
around?
REQUIREMENTS. Three
kinds:
1) University requirements for
a degree. Basically, you must
complete 180 units and 5 courses
in Humanities, in Social Sciences,
and in Natural Sciences. But
remember: you have four years to
do it. And also, there are no
courses you have to take freshman
year. Really. Of course, if you
want to "get it over with," that's
your hang-up. But when will you
get it over with and finally arrive.
Next year? When you graduate?
When you're married? When
you're settled in an occupation?
When??
2) Courses graduate schools
expect you to take.
3) Courses you make yourself
take.
PREREQUISITES. Often the
prerequisite is more a recom
mendation than an essential. For
example, you probably don't need
Psych 1 to take many of the
liiglier-nuinbeied courses, though
it might be helpful to syouJ v.n
evening skimming the Psych 1
text to get an overview of the
field. Nor is it essential to take the
introductory chemistry series
before Bio 10; high school chem
istry should be sufficient. (Of
course, some of the higher courses
in Biology expect a deeper know
ledge of chemistry.) When in
doubt, talk with students who
have had the course, and with the
instructor.

CLASS SIGN-UPS. If the class
you want is already filled up,
speak to the professor. If you're
enthusiastic, he'll probably let
you in. Also, go to the first few
meetings of the class. Usually
several students drop out.
INDIVIDUAL WORK. Every
department has provisions for
students to do individual work by
arrangement with a faculty mem
ber. For example, if you're really
onto studying the socio-cultural
history of professional athletics,
and no course seems to cover this
topic, find a groovy professor (or
instructor) and make individual
arrangements to do work under
his supervision. Or if you've
completed a course and still aren't
satisfied, go back for more. Make
arrangements with the professor
to do additional reading in the
subject. Also, these arrangements
usually beat large lecture halls.
PASS/FAIL. If you can't hack
the grade, take the course on a
pass/fail basis.
ADVISERS. Find your own.
You think you might be inter
ested in, say, European intellec
tual history, then find out whose
thing this is and speak to the
professor. Maybe hell recommend
several courses, or maybe he'll
suggest some individual work.
Also, seek advice from sponsors
and upperclassmen.
FREE UNIVERSITY. Check it
out.
DEAD WEEK. One of the
biggest myths at Stanford. This is
not a reading period. It's just a
warning that the end is near.
EXPLORE. Might as well enjoy
the ride, while you're along.
Maybe you'll dis-cover something.
Meet your professors. Invite them
to dinner, have a coffee break
with them in the union someday
after class. Find out what they're
onto. Compare experiences. Dis
cover who they are.
Audit a few classes. Check the
Time Schedule and drop into a
few neat-looking courses every
now and then. Maybe you'll find
something you'd like next time
around.
