A major change in
compensation policy for Stanford
University Hospital employees has
been announced by Dr. Thomas
A. Gonda, director of the
hospital.
The new policy, approved by
the hospital board of directors,
sets the hospital minimum wage
for full-time employees at $450 a
month, and calls for a standard
increase of $40 a month for all
other full-time hospital
employees.
In addition, it provides the
framework for other wage
adjustments based on merit,
promotion, and competition to
enable the hospital to attract and
retain outstanding employees at
all levels, Dr. Gonda said.
