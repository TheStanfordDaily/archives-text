# The 						University
## Place For Conflict?

Dr. Pitzer, members of the Facul
ty, members of the Class of '73:
The California sun casts long
shadows over the land as it sets
behind the foothills. Last year,
this campus was darkened by
shadows of another kind; the light
of academic freedom was ob
scured as the night of violence
brought a type of twilight period
to Leland Stanford's farm. The
question I wish to pose tonight is
whether we, as a student body,
are sufficiently intelligent and
far-sighted so that the high noon
of freedom, which can be ours,
need not be overtaken by the
dusk of repression and ignorance.
The three speakers tonight
present a very neat picture of the
divisions within the University —an
equilateral triangle representing
the three traditional constitu
encies: administration, faculty,
and students. Several years ago,
no one would have questioned
this representation; for the prob
lems which confronted the univer
sity community were of a strictly
internal nature, and it was only
natural that the members of the
community should divide along
those lines. But many changes,

some subtle and others more
obvious, have taken place in
recent years. The University finds
itself divided by problems no
longer strictly internal. And that
is part of the University's difficul
ty: it is divided over problems
that, as an institution, it is
powerless to solve, even if it could
reach a consensus, which it cannot
do and should not try to do. As
the University is now likely to
find factions labeled not by their
position in the University but by
their position along the political
spectrum. So tonight, though I
speak primarily to you as stu
dents, I speak also to administra
tion and faculty; but more im
portantly, I speak to those of all
political philosophies.
So, welcome to college; and in
particular, welcome to the excite
ment and challenge that is Stan
ford. Stanford is, in many ways,
as I hope you may have already
discovered, a friendly place. But
in one respect, it is properly
unfriendly: it is unfriendly to old
ideas. Hopefully, your present
opinions, your present manner of
viewing the world will be severely
questioned in the near future,
certainly before your first year at
Stanford is over. Not in order that
they be necessarily proven wrong,
but in order that their strengths
and weaknesses be objectively
analyzed, so that you can affirm
them intelligently, knowing them
to be sound, or else discard them.
Some of you are eagerly awaiting
this challenge, eager to cast away
"high school" thoughts and adopt
whatever happens to be the most
vociferously expounded philos
ophy. Others may be dreading the
insecurity that comes when life
long tenets must be justified
anew.
Actively Participate
Whatever your particular feel
ings at this point, I hope you
come to welcome and participate
actively in this questioning
process, for that process is vital to
the University's fundamental pur
pose: the search for truth. If we
are ever to approach success in
our search for truth, we must be
prepared to re-evaluate our atti-

tudes constantly as new informa
tion and new ideas become
available to us. Once we become
close-minded or cemented to an
ideology we are lost. The quest
for truth necessitates continuous
questioning and thus continuous
attempts at justification of our
beliefs. We must be prepared to
change if change is indicated. This
is a process that we cannot let
stagnate, either during our years
at Stanford or throughout life.
It is almost a truism that this
process requires freedom, true
freedom of thought and of ex
pression in an academic sense.
And yet as obvious as this
statement may seem to us now, in
the peace and tranquility of Frost
Amphitheatre, it unfortunately
seems equally apparent that some
of us will attempt to curtail this
freedom at Stanford during the
coming year. It is easy enough to
exercise this freedom and to allow
others to exercise it in classroom
or dormitory discussion. But what
about more difficult contexts?
What about truly controversial
issues?
It is here that the University
requires a great deal of us. It
requires, of course, that we
remain open-minded, not only in
calm times, but in crisis situations
as well; just picking a side and
digging will not do. Only in
always listening to all sides can we
ever hope to know the truth. But
more importantly, the University
requires of us an intellectual
honesty, a personal and public
honesty, with ourselves and with
others, in our exercise of and
maintenance of academic free
dom. This honesty consists of
several factors, among which are
the aforementioned open-minded
ness and also consistency in our
principles—that is, no double
standard, one applied to our
position and a different standard
for those with whom we disagree.
It is surprisingly easy to slip into
applying this double standard. To
be specific, I question the honesty
of those who disagree with the
American military when it makes
such statements as "It was neces
sary to destroy the village in order
to save it,"and yet are not at all
bothered by their own stand of
making violence in the name of
peace. I question the honesty of
those who preach humanism and
love and demand that all men be
respected as individual human
beings and yet must dehumanize
their so-called enemies in order to
make them easier to hate. I
question the honesty of those
who cry "Freedom for all the
people!" and yet work to shackle,
either discreetly or otherwise,
those with whom they disagree.
Express Opinions
If we demand academic free
dom, we must exercise that
freedom honestly, and we must
respect the right of others to do
the same. To look at the issue
from a different point of view, we
in the University must have the
right to express whatever opinions
we wish; on the other hand, we
never have any right to make
others agree. To extend Mr.
Justice Holmes' metaphor of the
marketplace of ideas: we have the
right to attempt to sell any idea,
any thought, any opinion at all;
but we have no power to make
others buy. The idea worth
disseminating will be enhanced by
honest and diligent scrutiny in the
open marketplace; the idea that
must be promoted by half-truths
or other subterfuge will have its
true value exposed. In the end, it
comes down to a matter of
personal characteristics: Do you
have the integrity to face all issues
with an open mind? Do you have
the intellectual capability to ex
pound your own position honest
ly? And do you have the courage
to resist those who would arbi
trarily assume the power to force,
and I mean literally force you to
buy what they are trying to sell?
If academic freedom is to survive,
we must all remain free to buy
ideas or not to buy, as we see fit,
with out decision based on intel
lectual grounds, not physical in
timidation.
The University is indeed the
proper place for conflict; but
conflict of ideas and opinions, not
pitched battle between armed
camps. The Stanford community
seems to be at a crossroads. Are
we going to continue down the
road of violence and moral totali
tarianism, so regretably entered
upon in recent years, with small
groups attempting to impose their
values on the rest of the com
munity by force or intimidation,
so sure of their rectitude (or
perhaps 1 should say so unsure of
their rectitude) that they wish to
prohibit non-believers from
speaking or even existing on
campus; or are we going to make a
turn down the road of academic
freedom, pursuing in earnest our
search for truth in an open
atmosphere where we can all be
stimulated by an uninhibited
exchange of ideas? A philosophy
with a strong foundation will not
be destroyed when the winds of
freedom blow. What does that say
for those who would prevent
viewpoints contrary to their own
from being expressed?
Remember: freedom is not a
condition, but a process. It is a
means as well as an end. We
cannot discard it, or deny it to
others, hoping to regain it for all
in the future, I hope that we at
Stanford are smart enough and
morally strong enough to preserve
our freedom for ourselves and for
freshmen vet unborn.

others buy. The idea worth
disseminating will be enhanced by
honest and diligent scrutiny in the
open marketplace; the idea that
must be promoted by half-truths
or other subterfuge will have its
true value exposed. In the end, it
comes down to a matter of
personal characteristics: Do you
have the integrity to face all issues
with an open mind? Do you have
the intellectual capability to ex
pound your own position honest
ly? And do you have the courage
to resist those who would arbi
trarily assume the power to force,
and I mean literally force you to
buy what they are trying to sell?
If academic freedom is to survive,
we must all remain free to buy
ideas or not to buy, as we see fit,
with out decision based on intel
lectual grounds, not physical in
timidation.
The University is indeed the
proper place for conflict; but
conflict of ideas and opinions, not
pitched battle between armed
camps. The Stanford community
seems to be at a crossroads. Are
we going to continue down the
road of violence and moral totali
tarianism, so regretably entered
upon in recent years, with small
groups attempting to impose their
values on the rest of the com
munity by force or intimidation,
so sure of their rectitude (or
perhaps 1 should say so unsure of
their rectitude) that they wish to
prohibit non-believers from
speaking or even existing on
campus; or are we going to make a
turn down the road of academic
freedom, pursuing in earnest our
search for truth in an open
atmosphere where we can all be
stimulated by an uninhibited
exchange of ideas? A philosophy
with a strong foundation will not
be destroyed when the winds of
freedom blow. What does that say
for those who would prevent
viewpoints contrary to their own
from being expressed?
Remember: freedom is not a
condition, but a process. It is a
means as well as an end. We
cannot discard it, or deny it to
others, hoping to regain it for all
in the future, I hope that we at
Stanford are smart enough and
morally strong enough to preserve
our freedom for ourselves and for
freshmen vet unborn.

Dr. Pitzer, members of the Facul
ty, members of the Class of '73:
The California sun casts long
shadows over the land as it sets
behind the foothills. Last year,
this campus was darkened by
shadows of another kind; the light
of academic freedom was ob
scured as the night of violence
brought a type of twilight period
to Leland Stanford's farm. The
question I wish to pose tonight is
whether we, as a student body,
are sufficiently intelligent and
far-sighted so that the high noon
of freedom, which can be ours,
need not be overtaken by the
dusk of repression and ignorance.
The three speakers tonight
present a very neat picture of the
divisions within the University —an
equilateral triangle representing
the three traditional constitu
encies: administration, faculty,
and students. Several years ago,
no one would have questioned
this representation; for the prob
lems which confronted the univer
sity community were of a strictly
internal nature, and it was only
natural that the members of the
community should divide along
those lines. But many changes,

some subtle and others more
obvious, have taken place in
recent years. The University finds
itself divided by problems no
longer strictly internal. And that
is part of the University's difficul
ty: it is divided over problems
that, as an institution, it is
powerless to solve, even if it could
reach a consensus, which it cannot
do and should not try to do. As
the University is now likely to
find factions labeled not by their
position in the University but by
their position along the political
spectrum. So tonight, though I
speak primarily to you as stu
dents, I speak also to administra
tion and faculty; but more im
portantly, I speak to those of all
political philosophies.
So, welcome to college; and in
particular, welcome to the excite
ment and challenge that is Stan
ford. Stanford is, in many ways,
as I hope you may have already
discovered, a friendly place. But
in one respect, it is properly
unfriendly: it is unfriendly to old
ideas. Hopefully, your present
opinions, your present manner of
viewing the world will be severely
questioned in the near future,
certainly before your first year at
Stanford is over. Not in order that
they be necessarily proven wrong,
but in order that their strengths
and weaknesses be objectively
analyzed, so that you can affirm
them intelligently, knowing them
to be sound, or else discard them.
Some of you are eagerly awaiting
this challenge, eager to cast away
"high school" thoughts and adopt
whatever happens to be the most
vociferously expounded philos
ophy. Others may be dreading the
insecurity that comes when life
long tenets must be justified
anew.
Actively Participate
Whatever your particular feel
ings at this point, I hope you
come to welcome and participate
actively in this questioning
process, for that process is vital to
the University's fundamental pur
pose: the search for truth. If we
are ever to approach success in
our search for truth, we must be
prepared to re-evaluate our atti-

tudes constantly as new informa
tion and new ideas become
available to us. Once we become
close-minded or cemented to an
ideology we are lost. The quest
for truth necessitates continuous
questioning and thus continuous
attempts at justification of our
beliefs. We must be prepared to
change if change is indicated. This
is a process that we cannot let
stagnate, either during our years
at Stanford or throughout life.
It is almost a truism that this
process requires freedom, true
freedom of thought and of ex
pression in an academic sense.
And yet as obvious as this
statement may seem to us now, in
the peace and tranquility of Frost
Amphitheatre, it unfortunately
seems equally apparent that some
of us will attempt to curtail this
freedom at Stanford during the
coming year. It is easy enough to
exercise this freedom and to allow
others to exercise it in classroom
or dormitory discussion. But what
about more difficult contexts?
What about truly controversial
issues?
It is here that the University
requires a great deal of us. It
requires, of course, that we
remain open-minded, not only in
calm times, but in crisis situations
as well; just picking a side and
digging will not do. Only in
always listening to all sides can we
ever hope to know the truth. But
more importantly, the University
requires of us an intellectual
honesty, a personal and public
honesty, with ourselves and with
others, in our exercise of and
maintenance of academic free
dom. This honesty consists of
several factors, among which are
the aforementioned open-minded
ness and also consistency in our
principles—that is, no double
standard, one applied to our
position and a different standard
for those with whom we disagree.
It is surprisingly easy to slip into
applying this double standard. To
be specific, I question the honesty
of those who disagree with the
American military when it makes
such statements as "It was neces
sary to destroy the village in order
to save it,"and yet are not at all
bothered by their own stand of
making violence in the name of
peace. I question the honesty of
those who preach humanism and
love and demand that all men be
respected as individual human
beings and yet must dehumanize
their so-called enemies in order to
make them easier to hate. I
question the honesty of those
who cry "Freedom for all the
people!" and yet work to shackle,
either discreetly or otherwise,
those with whom they disagree.
Express Opinions
If we demand academic free
dom, we must exercise that
freedom honestly, and we must
respect the right of others to do
the same. To look at the issue
from a different point of view, we
in the University must have the
right to express whatever opinions
we wish; on the other hand, we
never have any right to make
others agree. To extend Mr.
Justice Holmes' metaphor of the
marketplace of ideas: we have the
right to attempt to sell any idea,
any thought, any opinion at all;
but we have no power to make
others buy. The idea worth
disseminating will be enhanced by
honest and diligent scrutiny in the
open marketplace; the idea that
must be promoted by half-truths
or other subterfuge will have its
true value exposed. In the end, it
comes down to a matter of
personal characteristics: Do you
have the integrity to face all issues

about more difficult contexts?
What about truly controversial
issues?
It is here that the University
requires a great deal of us. It
requires, of course, that we
remain open-minded, not only in
calm times, but in crisis situations
as well; just picking a side and
digging will not do. Only in
always listening to all sides can we
ever hope to know the truth. But
more importantly, the University
requires of us an intellectual
honesty, a personal and public
honesty, with ourselves and with
others, in our exercise of and
maintenance of academic free
dom. This honesty consists of
several factors, among which are
the aforementioned open-minded
ness and also consistency in our
principles—that is, no double
standard, one applied to our
position and a different standard
for those with whom we disagree.
It is surprisingly easy to slip into
applying this double standard. To
be specific, I question the honesty
of those who disagree with the
American military when it makes
such statements as "It was neces
sary to destroy the village in order
to save it,"and yet are not at all
bothered by their own stand of
making violence in the name of
peace. I question the honesty of
those who preach humanism and
love and demand that all men be
respected as individual human
beings and yet must dehumanize
their so-called enemies in order to
make them easier to hate. I
question the honesty of those
who cry "Freedom for all the
people!" and yet work to shackle,
either discreetly or otherwise,
those with whom they disagree.
Express Opinions
If we demand academic free
dom, we must exercise that
freedom honestly, and we must
respect the right of others to do
the same. To look at the issue
from a different point of view, we
in the University must have the
right to express whatever opinions
we wish; on the other hand, we
never have any right to make
others agree. To extend Mr.
Justice Holmes' metaphor of the
marketplace of ideas: we have the
right to attempt to sell any idea,
any thought, any opinion at all;
but we have no power to make
others buy. The idea worth
disseminating will be enhanced by
honest and diligent scrutiny in the
open marketplace; the idea that
must be promoted by half-truths
or other subterfuge will have its
true value exposed. In the end, it
comes down to a matter of
personal characteristics: Do you
have the integrity to face all issues
with an open mind? Do you have
the intellectual capability to ex
pound your own position honest
ly? And do you have the courage
to resist those who would arbi
trarily assume the power to force,
and I mean literally force you to
buy what they are trying to sell?
If academic freedom is to survive,
we must all remain free to buy
ideas or not to buy, as we see fit,
with out decision based on intel
lectual grounds, not physical in
timidation.
The University is indeed the
proper place for conflict; but
conflict of ideas and opinions, not
pitched battle between armed
camps. The Stanford community
seems to be at a crossroads. Are
we going to continue down the
road of violence and moral totali
tarianism, so regretably entered
upon in recent years, with small
groups attempting to impose their
values on the rest of the com
munity by force or intimidation,
so sure of their rectitude (or
perhaps 1 should say so unsure of
their rectitude) that they wish to
prohibit non-believers from
speaking or even existing on
campus; or are we going to make a
turn down the road of academic
freedom, pursuing in earnest our
search for truth in an open
atmosphere where we can all be
stimulated by an uninhibited
exchange of ideas? A philosophy
with a strong foundation will not
be destroyed when the winds of
freedom blow. What does that say
for those who would prevent
viewpoints contrary to their own
from being expressed?
Remember: freedom is not a
condition, but a process. It is a
means as well as an end. We
cannot discard it, or deny it to
others, hoping to regain it for all
in the future, I hope that we at
Stanford are smart enough and
morally strong enough to preserve
our freedom for ourselves and for
freshmen vet unborn.

Dr. Pitzer, members of the Facul
ty, members of the Class of '73:
The California sun casts long
shadows over the land as it sets
behind the foothills. Last year,
this campus was darkened by
shadows of another kind; the light
of academic freedom was ob
scured as the night of violence
brought a type of twilight period
to Leland Stanford's farm. The
question I wish to pose tonight is
whether we, as a student body,
are sufficiently intelligent and
far-sighted so that the high noon
of freedom, which can be ours,
need not be overtaken by the
dusk of repression and ignorance.
The three speakers tonight
present a very neat picture of the
divisions within the University —an
equilateral triangle representing
the three traditional constitu
encies: administration, faculty,
and students. Several years ago,
no one would have questioned
this representation; for the prob
lems which confronted the univer
sity community were of a strictly
internal nature, and it was only
natural that the members of the
community should divide along
those lines. But many changes,

some subtle and others more
obvious, have taken place in
recent years. The University finds
itself divided by problems no
longer strictly internal. And that
is part of the University's difficul
ty: it is divided over problems
that, as an institution, it is
powerless to solve, even if it could
reach a consensus, which it cannot
do and should not try to do. As
the University is now likely to
find factions labeled not by their
position in the University but by
their position along the political
spectrum. So tonight, though I
speak primarily to you as stu
dents, I speak also to administra
tion and faculty; but more im
portantly, I speak to those of all
political philosophies.
So, welcome to college; and in
particular, welcome to the excite
ment and challenge that is Stan
ford. Stanford is, in many ways,
as I hope you may have already
discovered, a friendly place. But
in one respect, it is properly
unfriendly: it is unfriendly to old
ideas. Hopefully, your present
opinions, your present manner of
viewing the world will be severely
questioned in the near future,
certainly before your first year at
Stanford is over. Not in order that
they be necessarily proven wrong,
but in order that their strengths
and weaknesses be objectively
analyzed, so that you can affirm
them intelligently, knowing them
to be sound, or else discard them.
Some of you are eagerly awaiting
this challenge, eager to cast away
"high school" thoughts and adopt
whatever happens to be the most
vociferously expounded philos
ophy. Others may be dreading the
insecurity that comes when life
long tenets must be justified
anew.
Actively Participate
Whatever your particular feel
ings at this point, I hope you
come to welcome and participate
actively in this questioning
process, for that process is vital to
the University's fundamental pur
pose: the search for truth. If we
are ever to approach success in
our search for truth, we must be
prepared to re-evaluate our atti-

tudes constantly as new informa
tion and new ideas become
available to us. Once we become
close-minded or cemented to an
ideology we are lost. The quest
for truth necessitates continuous
questioning and thus continuous
attempts at justification of our
beliefs. We must be prepared to
change if change is indicated. This
is a process that we cannot let
stagnate, either during our years
at Stanford or throughout life.
It is almost a truism that this
process requires freedom, true
freedom of thought and of ex
pression in an academic sense.
And yet as obvious as this
statement may seem to us now, in
the peace and tranquility of Frost
Amphitheatre, it unfortunately
seems equally apparent that some
of us will attempt to curtail this
freedom at Stanford during the
coming year. It is easy enough to
exercise this freedom and to allow
others to exercise it in classroom
or dormitory discussion. But what
about more difficult contexts?
What about truly controversial
issues?
It is here that the University
requires a great deal of us. It

ment and challenge that is Stan
ford. Stanford is, in many ways,
as I hope you may have already
discovered, a friendly place. But
in one respect, it is properly
unfriendly: it is unfriendly to old
ideas. Hopefully, your present
opinions, your present manner of
viewing the world will be severely
questioned in the near future,
certainly before your first year at
Stanford is over. Not in order that
they be necessarily proven wrong,
but in order that their strengths
and weaknesses be objectively
analyzed, so that you can affirm
them intelligently, knowing them
to be sound, or else discard them.
Some of you are eagerly awaiting
this challenge, eager to cast away
"high school" thoughts and adopt
whatever happens to be the most
vociferously expounded philos
ophy. Others may be dreading the
insecurity that comes when life
long tenets must be justified
anew.
Actively Participate
Whatever your particular feel
ings at this point, I hope you
come to welcome and participate
actively in this questioning
process, for that process is vital to
the University's fundamental pur
pose: the search for truth. If we
are ever to approach success in
our search for truth, we must be
prepared to re-evaluate our atti-

tudes constantly as new informa
tion and new ideas become
available to us. Once we become
close-minded or cemented to an
ideology we are lost. The quest
for truth necessitates continuous
questioning and thus continuous
attempts at justification of our
beliefs. We must be prepared to
change if change is indicated. This
is a process that we cannot let
stagnate, either during our years
at Stanford or throughout life.
It is almost a truism that this
process requires freedom, true
freedom of thought and of ex
pression in an academic sense.
And yet as obvious as this
statement may seem to us now, in
the peace and tranquility of Frost
Amphitheatre, it unfortunately
seems equally apparent that some
of us will attempt to curtail this
freedom at Stanford during the
coming year. It is easy enough to
exercise this freedom and to allow
others to exercise it in classroom
or dormitory discussion. But what
about more difficult contexts?
What about truly controversial
issues?
It is here that the University
requires a great deal of us. It
requires, of course, that we
remain open-minded, not only in
calm times, but in crisis situations
as well; just picking a side and
digging will not do. Only in
always listening to all sides can we
ever hope to know the truth. But
more importantly, the University
requires of us an intellectual
honesty, a personal and public
honesty, with ourselves and with
others, in our exercise of and
maintenance of academic free
dom. This honesty consists of
several factors, among which are
the aforementioned open-minded
ness and also consistency in our
principles—that is, no double
standard, one applied to our
position and a different standard
for those with whom we disagree.
It is surprisingly easy to slip into
applying this double standard. To
be specific, I question the honesty
of those who disagree with the
American military when it makes
such statements as "It was neces
sary to destroy the village in order
to save it,"and yet are not at all
bothered by their own stand of
making violence in the name of
peace. I question the honesty of
those who preach humanism and
love and demand that all men be
respected as individual human
beings and yet must dehumanize
their so-called enemies in order to
make them easier to hate. I
question the honesty of those
who cry "Freedom for all the
people!" and yet work to shackle,
either discreetly or otherwise,
those with whom they disagree.
Express Opinions
If we demand academic free
dom, we must exercise that
freedom honestly, and we must
respect the right of others to do
the same. To look at the issue
from a different point of view, we
in the University must have the
right to express whatever opinions
we wish; on the other hand, we
never have any right to make
others agree. To extend Mr.
Justice Holmes' metaphor of the
marketplace of ideas: we have the
right to attempt to sell any idea,
any thought, any opinion at all;
but we have no power to make
others buy. The idea worth
disseminating will be enhanced by
honest and diligent scrutiny in the
open marketplace; the idea that
must be promoted by half-truths
or other subterfuge will have its
true value exposed. In the end, it
comes down to a matter of
personal characteristics: Do you
have the integrity to face all issues
with an open mind? Do you have
the intellectual capability to ex
pound your own position honest
ly? And do you have the courage
to resist those who would arbi
trarily assume the power to force,
and I mean literally force you to
buy what they are trying to sell?
If academic freedom is to survive,
we must all remain free to buy
ideas or not to buy, as we see fit,
with out decision based on intel
lectual grounds, not physical in
timidation.
The University is indeed the
proper place for conflict; but
conflict of ideas and opinions, not
pitched battle between armed
camps. The Stanford community
seems to be at a crossroads. Are
we going to continue down the
road of violence and moral totali
tarianism, so regretably entered
upon in recent years, with small
groups attempting to impose their
values on the rest of the com
munity by force or intimidation,
so sure of their rectitude (or
perhaps 1 should say so unsure of
their rectitude) that they wish to
prohibit non-believers from
speaking or even existing on
campus; or are we going to make a
turn down the road of academic
freedom, pursuing in earnest our
search for truth in an open
atmosphere where we can all be
stimulated by an uninhibited
exchange of ideas? A philosophy
with a strong foundation will not
be destroyed when the winds of
freedom blow. What does that say
for those who would prevent
viewpoints contrary to their own
from being expressed?
Remember: freedom is not a
condition, but a process. It is a
means as well as an end. We
cannot discard it, or deny it to
others, hoping to regain it for all
in the future, I hope that we at
Stanford are smart enough and
morally strong enough to preserve
our freedom for ourselves and for
freshmen vet unborn.

Dr. Pitzer, members of the Facul
ty, members of the Class of '73:
The California sun casts long
shadows over the land as it sets
behind the foothills. Last year,
this campus was darkened by
shadows of another kind; the light
of academic freedom was ob
scured as the night of violence
brought a type of twilight period
to Leland Stanford's farm. The
question I wish to pose tonight is
whether we, as a student body,
are sufficiently intelligent and
far-sighted so that the high noon
of freedom, which can be ours,
need not be overtaken by the
dusk of repression and ignorance.
The three speakers tonight
present a very neat picture of the
divisions within the University —an
equilateral triangle representing
the three traditional constitu
encies: administration, faculty,
and students. Several years ago,
no one would have questioned
this representation; for the prob
lems which confronted the univer
sity community were of a strictly
internal nature, and it was only
natural that the members of the
community should divide along
those lines. But many changes,

some subtle and others more
obvious, have taken place in
recent years. The University finds
itself divided by problems no
longer strictly internal. And that
is part of the University's difficul
ty: it is divided over problems
that, as an institution, it is
powerless to solve, even if it could
reach a consensus, which it cannot
do and should not try to do. As
the University is now likely to
find factions labeled not by their
position in the University but by
their position along the political
spectrum. So tonight, though I
speak primarily to you as stu
dents, I speak also to administra
tion and faculty; but more im
portantly, I speak to those of all
political philosophies.
So, welcome to college; and in
particular, welcome to the excite
ment and challenge that is Stan
ford. Stanford is, in many ways,
as I hope you may have already
discovered, a friendly place. But
in one respect, it is properly
unfriendly: it is unfriendly to old
ideas. Hopefully, your present
opinions, your present manner of
viewing the world will be severely
questioned in the near future,
certainly before your first year at
Stanford is over. Not in order that
they be necessarily proven wrong,
but in order that their strengths
and weaknesses be objectively
analyzed, so that you can affirm
them intelligently, knowing them
to be sound, or else discard them.
Some of you are eagerly awaiting
this challenge, eager to cast away
"high school" thoughts and adopt
