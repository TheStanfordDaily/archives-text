## Rational Change 
### Stephen J. Kline 
Some people claim that change
can be achieved in the academic
community only by confronta
tions, sit-ins, and other forms of
coercion or disruption because
due process does not work. Is this
true at Stanford? Let's have a
look at the record for 1968-69.
The source of the largest
number of changes during
1968-69 was the AAUP report
dated October 1968. This report
recommended 53 specific changes
in university governance—fifty for
action primarily by the faculty
and/or administration and three
primarily for action by student
government. My personal box
score on these recommendations
at 25 September 1969 stands as
follows:
Of the 50 Faculty/Administra
tion items—action com
pleted . . 30; action in process or
outcome dubious . . 11; no action
taken . . 9.
Of the 3 Student items—action
completed . . 1; action in process
or outcome dubious.. 0; no
action taken . . 2.
A few of these concern small
matters, but most concern very
important changes such as student
membership on working commit
tees of the faculty senate, revision
of the composition of the Board
of Trustees, the establishment of
regular channels of communica
tion for the Trustees to both
students and faculty, and other
similar matters.
The source of the second
argest number of changes was the
working reports of the SES study.
Owing to the interlocking of
many of these with each other
and the overlap with the AAUP
recommendations, it is hard to
make an independent count at
this stage where many are still in

the midst of study by the Student
SEC and Faculty Senate. How
ever, at least five more major
changes have come from this
source during 1968-69, and the
rate of progress suggests a much
larger number will be acted on
during 1969-70.
A third important source was
ad hoc committees appointed to
study issues raised publicly by
various people, mostly students,
but without confrontation.
Examples are the ROTC revisions,
changes in housing policy, changes
in minority programs, and again
the student membership on aca
demic council committees.
Public Pressure
A fourth source was public
pressure which included a sit-in.
This brought about the abolition
of "secret" research, as defined by
the faculty senate, on campus.
A fifth source was action by
student government, notably the
work of Denis Hayes in promul
gating and prodding an improved
governmental form.
A sixth important source was
the normal operation of the
faculty senate. The establishment
of this senate was in itself a major
change that started about four
years ago from a recommendation
by Herb Packer to the Academic
Council. The Senate approved
such changes as a major revision in
PhD exam procedures, worked
out a whole new committee
system for most parts of the
university, and adopted standard
procedures by which any student
complaint about academic affairs
signed by 4% of the student body
or approved by student senate
resolution will automatically be
taken up for consideration by the
faculty senate. Again there is a
large overlap with SES recom
mendations and AAUP recom
mendations. But it is safe to say
that at least five other major
changes were instituted that do
not overlap.
Total Changes
This count omits changes owing
to actions initiated by the trustees
and some other sources, where I
lack detailed information and, to
that extent, it is on the low side in
total count. Even so, the total box
score is forty to fifty major
changes depending on how one
counts "completion" and treats
partial overlaps. Of these just one
was brought about in part by use
of a sit-in.
In sum, the box score for 68-69
is at least forty to one for due
process and against sit-ins in
regard to actually creating im
portant 'change in the operations
of thy university.

Mechanical Engineering and state
mwide leader of the Moderate
Coalition for an Academic Com

years ago from a recommendation
by Herb Packer to the Academic
Council. The Senate approved
such changes as a major revision in
PhD exam procedures, worked
out a whole new committee
system for most parts of the
university, and adopted standard
procedures by which any student
complaint about academic affairs
signed by 4% of the student body
or approved by student senate
resolution will automatically be
taken up for consideration by the
faculty senate. Again there is a
large overlap with SES recom
mendations and AAUP recom
mendations. But it is safe to say
that at least five other major
changes were instituted that do
not overlap.
Total Changes
This count omits changes owing
to actions initiated by the trustees
and some other sources, where I
lack detailed information and, to
that extent, it is on the low side in
total count. Even so, the total box
score is forty to fifty major
changes depending on how one
counts "completion" and treats
partial overlaps. Of these just one
was brought about in part by use
of a sit-in.
In sum, the box score for 68-69
is at least forty to one for due
process and against sit-ins in
regard to actually creating im
portant 'change in the operations
of thy university.
(Stephen Kline is a Professor of
Mechanical Engineering and state
mwide leader of the Moderate
Coalition for an Academic Com
munity.)
Some people claim that change
can be achieved in the academic
community only by confronta
tions, sit-ins, and other forms of
coercion or disruption because
due process does not work. Is this
true at Stanford? Let's have a
look at the record for 1968-69.
The source of the largest
number of changes during
1968-69 was the AAUP report
dated October 1968. This report
recommended 53 specific changes
in university governance—fifty for
action primarily by the faculty
and/or administration and three
primarily for action by student
government. My personal box
score on these recommendations
at 25 September 1969 stands as
follows:
Of the 50 Faculty/Administra
tion items—action com
pleted . . 30; action in process or
outcome dubious . . 11; no action
taken . . 9.
Of the 3 Student items—action
completed . . 1; action in process
or outcome dubious.. 0; no
action taken . . 2.
A few of these concern small
matters, but most concern very
important changes such as student
membership on working commit
tees of the faculty senate, revision
of the composition of the Board
of Trustees, the establishment of
regular channels of communica
tion for the Trustees to both
students and faculty, and other
similar matters.
The source of the second
argest number of changes was the
working reports of the SES study.
Owing to the interlocking of
many of these with each other
and the overlap with the AAUP
recommendations, it is hard to
make an independent count at
this stage where many are still in

the midst of study by the Student
SEC and Faculty Senate. How
ever, at least five more major
changes have come from this
source during 1968-69, and the
rate of progress suggests a much
larger number will be acted on
during 1969-70.
A third important source was
ad hoc committees appointed to
study issues raised publicly by
various people, mostly students,
but without confrontation.
Examples are the ROTC revisions,
changes in housing policy, changes
in minority programs, and again
the student membership on aca
demic council committees.
Public Pressure
A fourth source was public
pressure which included a sit-in.
This brought about the abolition
of "secret" research, as defined by
the faculty senate, on campus.
A fifth source was action by
student government, notably the
work of Denis Hayes in promul
gating and prodding an improved
governmental form.
A sixth important source was
the normal operation of the
faculty senate. The establishment
of this senate was in itself a major
change that started about four
years ago from a recommendation
by Herb Packer to the Academic
Council. The Senate approved
such changes as a major revision in
PhD exam procedures, worked
out a whole new committee
system for most parts of the
university, and adopted standard
procedures by which any student
complaint about academic affairs
