# Chappie Review
## Relevance or Cliche 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
First of all, read last Thursday's
new Chaparral as soon as possible.
"The Magazine for Stanford"
represents an attempt to do a lot
of things all at once: muckrake,
help, explain, rage, entertain,
and publish communally. It's nota
complete success, but it gives
everyone a lot to look forward to.
The writers range from SDS to
old Daily staff liberals with an
additional collection of people
from last spring's April Third
Movement. All are gathered under
the banner of Relevance with the
happy result that the articles
speak to the Stanford community
rather than the world.
The new magazine started its
new organization last April when
students involved with the AEL
sit-in looked around for some
thing to replace the A3M's paper
Declassified, which ended with
the demonstration.
After a long summer of hassles
over the $16,400 debt and in
dependent control, the way was
cleared, and a radical metamor
phosis produced the latest 24-page
issue.
"It's really a question of
relevance. We want to begin the
kind of lives we want. We want to
live the revolution," explains
Michael Sweeney, one of the
writers. With this heavy statement
in mind the Chappie is a little
disappointing.
Not Much Muck
None of the rakes scoop up
much muck. Steve Weissman
could be right when he says,
"Paranoia is perception," but
he can hardly expect people to
regard some voluntary freshmen
tests as compelling proof. Other
polemics bog down with the
familiar and catch-all cliches such
as "men with power," "personal
liberation," and "Stanford's
bureaucrats never rest." Sure it's
true, but what a bore.
The satire never quite bites or
shows particular wit. The
"Kulchur" section is spotty: some
reviews are so short that Time or
Newsweek appear thoughtful and
exhaustive while another unedited
review rambles for two pages. But
this is no big deal; these objec
tions are entirely matters of
personal taste.
What hampered the edition
more than anything else were the
approach and tone of the main
articles. Obviously the writers
here are angry.
An Angry Child?
The cliche-cluttered style and
small time concerns, however, give
it the appearance of a child
choking with inarticulate anger.
To put it another way, the
Chaparral reaches to grasp some
irrefutable point only to end up
pawing thin air. Much of the issue
seems tangential, off the mark,
unfocused. It has the look of
petty grievances; there's no sign of
the pledge to "live the revolu
tion." Many people were expect
ing more than was delivered.
Sweeney, an ex-Daily editor,
sees the Chappie as "providing

what the Daily doesn't." For him
the "broader interests of the
Daily" which go with its role of
reporting campus events, as well
as it's structured staff organiza
tion, were impossible to work
with.
Communal Decisions
Decisions on the Chappie now
are made by all the people
working on the issue and ideally
no one alone runs the magazine.
These criticisms are only of one
issue, and there are definite plans
to publish biweekly, giving every
one a better glimpse. If the
magazine builds up a following
and can recruit enough workers, it
will become another member of
crowded local publishing market
which includes other radical
papers such as the Resistance's
Plain Rapper, the Peninsula Ob
server (Herb Caen's choice as the
best written underground paper
whatever that term means), and
the Pacific Study Center's month
ly newsletter.
In addition there are the less
radical Cross Currents run by
David Jones, former head of the
Committee for New Democratic
Politics, the Black Student
Union's Colonist, and the paper
you are now reading, not to
mention the love-it-or-leave-it
efforts of the Arena and its
country cousin, the Palo Alio
Times.
