# Home Is Where Your Dorm Is...

"According to the map if we
turn out of the hotel to the right
we can follow the thin red line
here over past my thumb, across
the athletic field, around that
little round building and down the
street to the dorm."
Despite my directions, we
finally managed to wheel up in
front of the Stern Houses.
The arrow marked 'frosh' led
me to a young lady behind a desk
whose cool only enhanced my
own uneasiness. I gave her my
name in the most collegiate voice
I could muster and she slipped a
small packet into my sweaty
fingers as if she had been ex
pecting me."You'll find your meal
ticket, room key, mailbox key,
information packet, and bill en
closed."
"You mean they're giving me a
bill before I even do anything?"

"Yes."
"Oh."
Opening the packet and un
folding the bill my eyes caught a
charge at the bottom:
IHC GIRP ... $ .50
I couldn't figure that one but it
must mean If Hungry Choose
Great International Russian
Pancakes.
Why it cost me 50c to find this
out is a mystery.

A suitcase emerged through the
door and its voice asked "Where?"
in a tone exclusive to those
searching for a men's room or on
the brink of a double hernia.
"On the bed I guess," said I as I
pulled my teddy bear away from
impending doom. "Not as much
closet space as home," my mother
observed.
"I can still hand my hat," I
replied stoicly.

"Fraid not, it wouldn't fit in
the car," informed my father
holding a clothes bundle.
Had my parents waited to meet
my roommate, the six hour ordeal
would have broken all constitu
tional guarantees of freedom from
cruel and unjust punishment.
Peter did arrive finally and after I
had known him for minutes I
found myself in the position of
confessor. "Soon you will hear
the patter of little feet around
here," he reported tearfully.
"You mean?"
"That's right, I have to get up
at 6:30 every morning to hash."

I was tremendously impressed
with the first official and formal
gathering arranged for the mem
bers of the freshman class (with a
grain of sa't). I digested every
word and sat comfortable in the
knowledge that I was not the only
realist (others persist in using the
word cynic) on campus.
I knew that for four years I
could look forward to challenge,
intellectual stimulation, emotional
ecstasy, academic enrichment,
spiritual fulfillment, and incessant
processionals.

Later that night, at the house
party I talked with Lorrie from
Phoenix and was comforted
knowing that my anxieties,
doubts, apprehensions were
shared as I embarked on four
years of college.
"How do you like your new
environment, how do you like
your roommate?"
"She is just great, I think it will
work out."
"If it doesn't... we can always
trade."
Who says Stanford people
won't go out of their way to do
favors?

WELCOME to the reservation. A friendly native greets the tribe's recruits with all
the paraphenalia needed to confuse them. The frosh all seem to have one question
on their minds, "How?"
