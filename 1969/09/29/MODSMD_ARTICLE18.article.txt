# YAF Spats Delay Arena's Publishing
## 
### 
The reappearance of The
Arena, Stanford's own right-wing
underground newspaper, has been
delayed by a factional dispute in
the Young Americans for Free
dom (YAF).

This dispute, between liber
tarian and traditional factions in
the conservative youth group, has
occupied much of the time and
attention of Harvey Hukari, a
communications graduate student,
the founder and guru of the
paper.
Hukari, head of the Stanford
YAF group, has expressed the
hope that The Arena will re
surface as soon as the YAF
squabble is resolved. He has, in
the past, been an active opponent
of SDS and other student radical
groups.
His paper was founded in an
attempt to counterbalance the
alleged left-wing bias of The
Stanford Daily and has appeared
sporadically, most recently on a
biweekly basis.
Arena has been distributed free
of charge on campus since being
founded eighteen months ago. It
apparently is funded by donations
from conservative alumni and
parents. Hukari has categorically
denied receiving any support from
corporations and the CIA.
