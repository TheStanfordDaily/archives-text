# Pitzer Denounces 'Anti-Riot' Bills
## 
### 
Stanford President Kenneth
Pitzer told a Senate subcommittee
this summer that the so called
"anti-riot"bills "do more harm
than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus."
Pitzer was tesitfying in
response to a subpoena from the
McClellan committee investigating
last year's student unrest. In June,
the committee had asked for the
financial aid records of 27
students accused of rioting, in
order to determine whether they
were receiving Federal grants,
which under the law must be cut
off if the student disrupts the
university.
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided or destroyed
by attacks from without or
within, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which

they are based," Pitzer continued.
He also said, "One of our great
concerns now is that the turning
point may have come too
late —that we may find ourselves
the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we work hard to solve these
problems for ourselves."
Information Supplied
Pitzer provided the committee
on June 3 with the names of 16
people found guilty of taking part
in campus disruptions and listed
information on Federal financial
aid received by 90 individuals.
The committee had also
requested information on the
officers and membership of
certain on campus organizations.
President Pitzer informed the
Senate subcommittee that
Stanford no longer requires
organizations to file their officers
names, or their membership and
would be unable to supply that
information.
"Indeed, I would by most
reluctant in any event,"he said
"to disclose the names of those
individuals without some
clarification of the scope and
purpose of your investigation and
the possible pertinency that such
names could have to that
purpose."
The students and organizations
for which information was
requested were those against
whom Stanford obtained an
injunction forbidding further
disruptive actions after the Encina
occupation, last May.
Associate Dean of Engineering
and Director of the Applied
Electronics Laboratory (AEL)
William Rambo also spoke to the
Senate group urging rejection of
further anti-riot measures. AEL
was forced to halt operations
during a student occupation April
9-18.
Add Nothing
"These (proposed) measures,"
he stated, "add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the University. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
University community for the
president, and the administration
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise authority."
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous," Rambo said.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
The Faculty Senate praised
Pitzer and the other Stanford
officials who testified before the
subcommittee. In a statement
adopted by acclamation, they
commended them for "their
perceptive and effective support
of the values of the academic
community."
Freedom of the Essence
"Freedom is the essence of the
University," Pitzer told the
senators. "As all of us know, it is
also the heart of the democratic
process.
"Its historic importance to the
academic community accounts for
the reluctance of many persons on
campus to impose or support
harsh penalties on those found
guilty of all but the most seriously
disruptive acts."
Counseling against outside
force Pitzer said, "The tough
problem is to prevent the radicals
from expanding their ranks. On
more than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results.

Add Nothing
"These (proposed) measures,"
he stated, "add nothing to the
authority already in existence in
the University. Their application
would substantially undermine
the essential support of the
University community for the
president, and the administration
and hence reduce their practical
power to exercise authority."
"The positive, direct effect can
only be small; the negative effect,
though indirect, can be
enormous," Rambo said.
"The real pressure for campus
stability must come from within,"
he emphasized.
The Faculty Senate praised
Pitzer and the other Stanford
officials who testified before the
subcommittee. In a statement
adopted by acclamation, they
commended them for "their
perceptive and effective support
of the values of the academic
community."
Freedom of the Essence
"Freedom is the essence of the
University," Pitzer told the
senators. "As all of us know, it is
also the heart of the democratic
process.
"Its historic importance to the
academic community accounts for
the reluctance of many persons on
campus to impose or support
harsh penalties on those found
guilty of all but the most seriously
disruptive acts."
Counseling against outside
force Pitzer said, "The tough
problem is to prevent the radicals
from expanding their ranks. On
more than one occasion, the rapid
resort to outside force on a
university campus has had
extremely unfortunate results.
Stanford President Kenneth
Pitzer told a Senate subcommittee
this summer that the so called
"anti-riot"bills "do more harm
than good to the cause of
maintaining—or restoring—peace
on campus."
Pitzer was tesitfying in
response to a subpoena from the
McClellan committee investigating
last year's student unrest. In June,
the committee had asked for the
financial aid records of 27
students accused of rioting, in
order to determine whether they
were receiving Federal grants,
which under the law must be cut
off if the student disrupts the
university.
"We must not, we dare not, let
our institutions of learning be
weakened, divided or destroyed
by attacks from without or
within, which strike at the
fundamental freedoms on which

they are based," Pitzer continued.
He also said, "One of our great
concerns now is that the turning
point may have come too
late —that we may find ourselves
the victims of a massive
counter-attack from an angry
American public, fed up with
campus antics across the country
and too impatient to bear with us
as we work hard to solve these
problems for ourselves."
Information Supplied
Pitzer provided the committee
on June 3 with the names of 16
people found guilty of taking part
in campus disruptions and listed
information on Federal financial
aid received by 90 individuals.
The committee had also
requested information on the
officers and membership of
certain on campus organizations.
President Pitzer informed the
Senate subcommittee that
Stanford no longer requires
organizations to file their officers
names, or their membership and
would be unable to supply that
information.
"Indeed, I would by most
reluctant in any event,"he said
"to disclose the names of those
individuals without some
clarification of the scope and
purpose of your investigation and
the possible pertinency that such
names could have to that
purpose."
The students and organizations
for which information was
requested were those against
whom Stanford obtained an
injunction forbidding further
disruptive actions after the Encina
occupation, last May.
