# Test Director, Critic Debate Frosh Survey
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
More than 200 freshmen
watched last night as former
graduate student Steve Weissman
and Counseling and Testing Di
rector John Black spelled out the
controversy surrounding the
Freshmen Demographic Survey.
This morning and tomorrow
freshmen are scheduled to com
plete American Council on Edu
cation (ACE) questionnaires
which cover a variety of topics
family income, religion, edu
cational and career aspirations,
and activities, including partici
pation in political protests. The
data can be used to draw a profile
of the Class of '73 at Stanford and
nationally.
Weissman, in an article in
Stanford's magazine Chaparral,
claimed the survey could be used
in attempts to develop a profile of
students who become radicals.
The tests are signed on a volun

tary basis, and follow-up studies
made.
In the Wilbur Courtyard last
night, Weissman maintained that
universities could use the profile
to exclude applicants who were
likely to become protestors. He
felt the study was not designed to
glean incriminating information
from students taking the question
naires.
One SDS member said last
night that some SDSers would
probably come to testing lo
cations to encourage boycotting
the test. SDS has also printed a
leaflet "asking that no one take
the radical-sniffing test."
Studies For Change
Black said the University had
gained valuable information from
similar surveys which had been
studied in planning changes for
Stanford. "I can assure you that
Stanford will not use the data to
weed out protestors," Black said.

The testing director said the
tests were harmless because they
were taken after admission and
students could decline to answer
any questions or sign their names.
Weissman denounced the sur
vey as representing a method of
"change through channeling infor
mation up to managers rather
than democratically speaking to
gether." He predicted no radical
profile could be drawn because all
types of students protest when
they see the world around them.
The Wilbur gathering and a
meeting at Roble were organized
at the behest of several parties,
according to Wilbur-Branner di
rector Jim Glenn. He said the
Dean of Students office had
requested a discussion of the test
be included in the pre-reg program
after the controversy developed.
The pre-reg committee did not
organize a program, so dorms
hosted the gatherings last night.
