# Pre-Reg Panel
## Draft Options Told 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
The most difficult question
facing young men today is "how
to make decisions in terms of
your own sense of social responsi
bility, and not General Hershey's
or anybody else's," Special Serv
ices Counselor Alan Strain told
250 freshmen Thursday after
noon.
Strain spoke with Army
Colonel Ramey, Marine Corps
Colonel Thomas, Air Force Lt.
Colonel Hienle, and several under
graduate cadets in a forum on
military service and the draft, part
of Stanford's Pre-Registration
program. Ramey, Thomas, and
Hienle are directors of the ROTC
program for their respective serv
ices at Stanford.
Strain advised all freshmen to
become aware of the basic provi
sions of the draft law, and to seek
advice and information in his
office whenever in doubt.
He cautioned the audience to,
"Give yourself time to see what
Stanford is all about, and what

your interaction with Stanford is
going to produce."
Army Cadet Osborn began his
afternoon panel with a description
of the Army ROTC program, and
the courses and training it in
cludes. He mentioned several
advantages of ROTC. First, he
noted that "you have to put in
some time whether you're a
draftee or a ROTC Lieutenant,"
and "Army ROTC provides a very
good alternative to draftee serv
ice."
Second, according to Osborn,
ROTC provides excellent leader
ship and management training
which could eventually lead to
great opportunities in business.
Statistics show that 28% of
America's corporate elite, earning
between $100,000 and $330,000
per year had ROTC training.
A third obvious advantage is
the financial assistance provided
each cadet. Junior and Senior
cadets receive $50 per month
during the school year and
$171.60 per month for the six

week summer training program.
Also, students may apply for a
full scholarship if they are willing
to give an extra two years of
active service.
Midshipman Peters, who fol
lowed Osborn, listed as the
disadvantages of the Navy ROTC
program the requirement that
cadets must take at least 3 units
of naval science each quarter, and
also the fact that two summers are
taken up in training cruises.
He noted, however, numerous
advantages, such as that of having
"your whole life planned out for
you" and not having to worry
about the draft, or the fact that
more and more businesses are
"recruiting" military officers.
Lt. Colonel Hienle followed,
stressing his intention not to
recruit anyone who might have
the slightest apprehensions or
reservations about service in the
Air Force.
For those who might be unsure
of the purpose of the Air Force,
he made it clear that "the mission
of the Air Force is to fly and
fight. That is our business, and
without it we would have no
reason for existing."
After the Lt. Colonel's remarks,
Strain rose to discuss the draft.
Strain, interrupted several times
by enthusiastic applause, detailed
the enormous effect that the draft
would have on the lives of the
freshmen in the audience. It
would, he noted, affect the choice
of courses and careers, the state of
our physical and psychological
health.
In dealing with the question of
the morality of the war and
military service, Air Force cadet
Schade expressed support for
ROTC by claiming that "you can
do as much to change society and
policy within the system as
without it."

Statistics show that 28% of
America's corporate elite, earning
between $100,000 and $330,000
per year had ROTC training.
A third obvious advantage is
the financial assistance provided
each cadet. Junior and Senior
cadets receive $50 per month
during the school year and
$171.60 per month for the six

week summer training program.
Also, students may apply for a
full scholarship if they are willing
to give an extra two years of
active service.
Midshipman Peters, who fol
lowed Osborn, listed as the
disadvantages of the Navy ROTC
program the requirement that
cadets must take at least 3 units
of naval science each quarter, and
also the fact that two summers are
taken up in training cruises.
He noted, however, numerous
advantages, such as that of having
"your whole life planned out for
you" and not having to worry
about the draft, or the fact that
more and more businesses are
"recruiting" military officers.
Lt. Colonel Hienle followed,
stressing his intention not to
recruit anyone who might have
the slightest apprehensions or
reservations about service in the
Air Force.
For those who might be unsure
of the purpose of the Air Force,
he made it clear that "the mission
of the Air Force is to fly and
fight. That is our business, and
without it we would have no
reason for existing."
After the Lt. Colonel's remarks,
Strain rose to discuss the draft.
Strain, interrupted several times
by enthusiastic applause, detailed
the enormous effect that the draft
would have on the lives of the
freshmen in the audience. It
would, he noted, affect the choice
of courses and careers, the state of
our physical and psychological
health.
In dealing with the question of
the morality of the war and
military service, Air Force cadet
Schade expressed support for
ROTC by claiming that "you can
do as much to change society and
policy within the system as
without it."


NEWLY APPOINTED—David C. Weber (left) will take over the position of
director of libraries, beginning October 1. Professor Albert llastorf (right) will
become the new dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences at the start of
spring quarter.
The most difficult question
facing young men today is "how
to make decisions in terms of
your own sense of social responsi
bility, and not General Hershey's
or anybody else's," Special Serv
ices Counselor Alan Strain told
250 freshmen Thursday after
noon.
Strain spoke with Army
Colonel Ramey, Marine Corps
Colonel Thomas, Air Force Lt.
Colonel Hienle, and several under
graduate cadets in a forum on
military service and the draft, part
of Stanford's Pre-Registration
program. Ramey, Thomas, and
Hienle are directors of the ROTC
program for their respective serv
ices at Stanford.
Strain advised all freshmen to
become aware of the basic provi
sions of the draft law, and to seek
advice and information in his
office whenever in doubt.
He cautioned the audience to,
"Give yourself time to see what
Stanford is all about, and what

your interaction with Stanford is
going to produce."
Army Cadet Osborn began his
afternoon panel with a description
of the Army ROTC program, and
the courses and training it in
cludes. He mentioned several
advantages of ROTC. First, he
noted that "you have to put in
some time whether you're a
draftee or a ROTC Lieutenant,"
and "Army ROTC provides a very
good alternative to draftee serv
ice."
Second, according to Osborn,
ROTC provides excellent leader
ship and management training
which could eventually lead to
great opportunities in business.
