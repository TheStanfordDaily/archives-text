# Official's Orders
## Paper Confiscated 
### 
The dispute over where, when,
and from whom incoming fresh
men can receive information has
opened on a new front since
2,000 copies of Cross Currents, a
newspaper published by a Stan
ford graduate student, were con
fiscated from Frost Amphitheater
before Convocation Friday, on
the orders of a University official.
David Jones, editor and pub
lisher of the paper, and former
head of the Committee for a New
Politics, left stacks of the paper at
the ends of the aisles in Frost at
four Friday afternoon. He was
informed later in the evening,
while Convocation was underway,
that the papers had been removed.
Tom Bacchetti, director of
Public Events for the University,
gave the work crew orders to
remove the papers before the
Convocation without the know
ledge of the crew's head Bill
Cleveland. They were placed in a
Dipsy Dumpster truck, where
they were found by Cleveland the

next morning. He then moved
them to his office.
Bacchetti was not available for
comment ounday night.
"It was inappropriate to have
other material distributed at a
University function," Jones
quoted Bacchetti as saying.
Bacchetti told Jones that he
ordered the papers removed at his
own discretion. Neither the Pre-
Registration Commission nor
Cleveland were informed by
Bacchetti of his action.
"Self-selecting of information
will bring the University down on
itself," Jones warned following
the episode. "What is Pre-registra
tion if it's no more than a lot of
little freshmen minds being fed at
the discretion of University of
ficials?"
Copies of the Resistance news
paper, Plain Rapper, were distri
buted at Convocation, during
President Pitzer's address.
