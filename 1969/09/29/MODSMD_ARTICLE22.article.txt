# Action -Oriented
## New Courses Formed 
### HILL FREIVOGEL 
Students and faoulty, con
cerned over what they see as a
death of courses related to exist
ing social problems, have organ
ized a number of three-unit
undergraduate specials that they
consider more relevant.
The majority of these courses is
part of Stanford Workshops on
Political and Social Issues,
(5.W.0.P.5.1.), organized by Tim
Coburn and ASSU Co-President
Joyce Kobayashi. (See Coburn
column, page 2).
5.W.0.P.5.1, offers ten work
shops designed to "study issues of
local and national concern
directlyâ€”specifically in order to
consider what can be done about
them."
Synopses of workshops to be
offered during the Fall Quarter
will be distributed at the Pavilion
today and tomorrow during Regis
tration. All organizational and
enrollment meetings will be Octo
ber 1 and 2 at times and places
announced in the synopses.
Course titles and workshop
leaders are:

"Arms Control and Disarma
ment Negotiations Between The
U.S. and The U.S.S.R.", Professor
W.K.H. Panofsky; "Privacy In the
Computer Age", Lance Hoffman;
"Research Policy And Society"
Professor H. Holman.
"Public Education And Moti
vation In The Use Of Health
Services", William C. Fowkes,
M.D.; "The Pescadero Dam Pro
ject", Professor James Bjorken;
"LiOgging Policy In California",
Professor Allan V. Cox.
"Industrialization And Housing

Three other action-oriented
courses are sponsored by the
ASSU Committee on Urban and
Environmental Curriculum.
"Urban Community Behavior,"

an interdisplinary course with
faculty from sociology, political
science and engineering-economic
system is being offered this fall.
"Urban Design and the Eco
system," a field study course is
offered in the winter and"The
Urban Dweller" in the spring.
Also given this fall is "Chemical
and Biological Warfare," a
"Special Studies" course spon
sored by Dr. Richard Holm as
Biology 199. The course is de
signed not only to inform the
student but also to encourage him
"to take an active role in the
current national controversy over
the use of such warfare." The
latter goal will be the object of a
symposium to be held in late
January.
