# Plunkett Off, But Tribe Rolls
## 
### FRED MANN 
"Yeah, Stanford's got a good
team this year, but it's all
Plunkett. What happens if he has
an off day?"
The question was finally an
swered Saturday, when junior
quarterback Jim Plunkett had the
first really off day of his two year
varsity career. (Keep in mind, a
bad day for Jim is still pretty
impressive.) He completed 14
passes for two touchdowns and
200 yards total through the air.
But he was not sharp.
He also missed on 18 attempts,
was saved by a couple of great
catches, and tossed three inter
ceptions. But when things weren't
going right for the Chief, a couple
of other Indians took control.
Don Parish made 17 tackles and
led a much improved defense, and
fullback Howie Williams rushed
for over 100 yards in the first half

alone, as Stanford pushed through
a stubborn flock of Oregon
Ducks, 28-0, in the Pac-8 opener
for both schools.
"Jim was extremely nervous
before and throughout the game,"
said Coach John Ralston. "We
don't know why, but you can bet
we will try and find out, so he can
relax out there."
Ralston had nothing but praise
for the defense—the supposed
weak link in the Stanford football
machine. The shutout was the
Tribe's third in the last four
games, including the final two
outings of last year. Linebacker
Pat Preston aided Parish in plug
ging the holes with 14 tackles,
and Jack Schultz added 11.
Offense Missing
In what was billed as a big
offensive show, both teams sput
tered in the first half. The Indians

led the statistical race by a big
margin, but led on the board only
7-0.
Stanford moved the ball and
controlled the tempo of the game,
but couldn't find the end zone. In
the first two periods the Cards
piled up 13 first downs to 3 for
Oregon, and gained 223 yards to
68 for the visitops, but it was not
until 3:09 remained in the half
that the first points went up.
Plunkett capped a 62-yard drive
finding big tight end Bob Moore
wide open in the right corner of
the end zone for a three yard TD
pass. Steve Horowitz converted,
and the highly touted Indians left
the field with a shakey 7-0 lead.
Tough Defense
As it turned out, seven points
was plenty, as the Tribe's defense
did a fine job containing high
scoring Oregon. Bill Alexander
dumped the Ducks' Tom Blan
chard five times, and, of course,
Parish was everywhere.
Oregon's super-sophomore slot
back, Bobby Moore was held to
only four catches as the Injun
secondary tripled up on him.
Because of the special coverage,
Blanchard hit on many delay
screen passes for short yardage.
But the Stanford gamble paid off
as they were not hurt by the small
gainers.
Williams proved himself a
capable workhorse in the back
field. Howie broke tackles and
twisted for extra yardage on every
play. With Bubba Brown (or his
backup man Jackie Brown) and
Williams in the backfield, Stan
ford has a rugged running attack

to compliment the passing of
Plunkett and Don Bunce.
Guards George Crooks and Bob
Reinhard opened big holes in the
line for the backs. Reinhard also
boomed six punts for a 45 yard
average.
Return Woes
Again the only real weak spot
appeared to be punt returns, as
the Indian deep men often
couldn't decide whether to field
the ball or not. The result was a
fumble and some minus yardage
rpturns.
As the second half began,
Plunkett got over his jitters, and
led a beautiful scoring drive to put
the Cards up 14-0. The score came
on a 45-yard pass to JC transfer
Randy Vataha on a play that
crossed up the Oregon deep backs.
Plunkett dropped back to pass
and looked for primary receiver
Bob Moore. As Moore made his
cut over the middle, safety Bill
Drake moved to cover him,
leaving Vataha wide open down
the side line. It was one of the few
mistakes Drake made all day, as
he led Oregon with 13 tackles.
The rest of the third quarter
was spent with both clubs trading
punts, and Oregon's Jack Gleason
picking off his third Plunkett
aerial, to tie a school record.
Shutout Saved
In Oregon's deepest penetra
tion, Jim Kauffman saved the
Stanford shutout by knocking
down a Blanchard pass in the end
zone midway through the final
period. The Indians took over on
their own 26, and after a pair of
fine runs by Jackie Brown, and a
quick pass over the middle to
reserve tight end Ron Kadziel,

Bubba Brown took off on a
33-yard TD romp to make it 21-0.
By then, the game was in the
bag. Bunce replaced Flunkett and
Jack Alustiza ran well from
fullback. liis 25 yard breakaway
put the Tribe on the Oregon 36
with just 33 left to play. Bunce
wont to the air, and the Cards
used their time outs, trying to
score again.
They did. On the last play of
the game, Bunce found sopho
more fullback Hillary Shockley
with a 16-varder to push the total
to 28.
Pouring It On?
Questioned after the game,
Coach Ralston said that he had
instructed Bunce to go for the
score once they had passed the
midfield strip. "We had been
playing conservatively," he re
marked. "You can't tell the boys
not to try to score."
Just a week before, Ralston and
the Indians were accused of
"pouring it on" against San Jose
State by using their timeouts, and
attempting to add another mean
ingless touchdown. Stanford won,
63-21.
All in all, it was a slow
offensive performance by Stan
ford. Much credit must be given
to the Ducks' strong pass defense,
and their massive midget middle
guard; Dave Walker. Walker stands
5-7, and weighs 200 pounds.
The small inconsistencies will
be worked out in time, but the
time better be this week. Next
Saturday, the Indians do battle in
Lafayette, Indiana against Purdue,
another pood but inconsistent
team. Saturday they were very
good and won. Over Notre Dame.


BREAK ON THROUGH—Howie Willi jrns enjoyed his most successful
day Saturday, leading Stanford to a "0-0 win over Oregon. Williams
turns straight into Mike Kish and Jim Siud.lin of the Ducks, hut, as
always, spins off for a gain.
