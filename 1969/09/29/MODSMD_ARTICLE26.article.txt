September 23 issue of Look, they predict Stanford will finish 9-1 on
the season, and will lose to Indiana on New Year's Day in Pasadena.

and also UCLA as even better. The Associated Press selects Stanford
as number 16, and UCLA as 17, but puts the Trojans fifth.
Playboy ranks the Indians ninth, and Sports Illustrated names them

third place finish. California was picked a close fourth followed by
Oregon, Oregon State, Washington, and Washington State.
