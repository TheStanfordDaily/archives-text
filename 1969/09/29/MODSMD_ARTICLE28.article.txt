# Hockey Team Starts Practice
## 
### 
The Stanford ice hockey team
will be a charter member of the
Bay Area Hockey League in its
inaugural season this winter. The
League is composed of four
teams: the San Francisco Hawks,
Berkeley Bruins, Belmont Oaks,
and the Indian six.
E. Fuller Torrey, M.D., a
32-year old resident in psychiatry
medicine at the Stanford Hospital,
was elected the first President of
the newly created circuit. Besides

his professional credentials—he is
the author of Ethical Issues in
Medicine: The Role of the Phys
ician in Today's Society (Little
Brown, 1968) and about 25
scientific articles—Doctor Torrey
is a 1959 graduate of Princeton
University, where he was a star
wing and team-mate of Barry von
Gerbig, who until recently owned
the Oakland Seals.
The Stanford team, like the
league itself, is largely Torrey's

creation. Instituted last January as
an informal club, it soon attracted
nearly 30 members of widely
varying ability. With a nucleus of
10 to 12 reasonably experienced
players, the team scheduled eight
games against all comers, winning
three and losing five.
Tryouts and practice will begin
at 10:15 p.m., Sunday, October 5,
at the Belmont Ice Rink. Inter
ested persons are urged to call
Bob Kadlec at 948-1654


A BUNCE BOMB—Stanford's backup quarterback Don Bunce unloads a pass against Oregon. Bunco, who
has die unenviable position of playing behind Jim Plunkett, Tossed the final touchdown pass to Hillary
Shockley Saturday. Don would probably be a starter at any other school in the west, but must
playing time with Jim this season and next.
