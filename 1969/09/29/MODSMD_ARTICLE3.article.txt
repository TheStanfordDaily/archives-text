## Intercept Methods Criticized 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Despite
complaints about zealous inspec
tors peeking into the purses and
lunchboxes of school children and
some travelers to remove and
unbutton some of their clothing
for personal searches, the United
States said Sunday it has been
successful with its Mexican border
crackdown on drug smuggling.
The week-long crackdown saw
1,824 of the 1.98 million people
checked at border stations under
going personal searches, only 33
persons arrested and 405 seizures
of an unspecified amount of
marijuana and drugs.
In the personal searches,
government spokesmen said, some
women are required to remove
their jackets and unbutton their
blouses and some men are forced
to take off jackets and vests and

loosen their clothing so the
garmets can be inspected.
The Mexican vice counsul at
Brownsville, Tex., filed a protest
after he and his wife were
stopped.
The search is part of Operation
Intercept, which has dropped
what some people now call a
"grass curtain" across the 2,000
mile border from the Pacific Coast
to the Gulf of Mexico.
Travelers are complaining of
long delays as the inspectors
search virtually everything and
everyone crossing the border.
Mexican and American border
town businessmen agree that
stopping drug traffic is a noble
cause, but said tying up auto
traffic for one to six hours is
disastrous.

WASHINGTON (AP)-Cesar
Chavez said Sunday night a
wicked combination of the De
fense Department and big agricul
tural interests is keeping alive the
California grape pickers strike.
Speaking from the pulpit of the
National Cathedral, the 42-year
old Mexican American told 2,000
supporters the four-year old strike
would end almost immediately if
the Pentagon would stop buying
grapes.
Chavez said sale of table grapes
has decreased 30 percent since the
strike began September 1965.
"What's happening to that 30
percent?," Chavez asked. Me said
more grapes are going into fruit
cocktail, more are being used as
raisins, and the Defense depart-

ment is buying over 40 percent
more than it used to.
Chavez is in the East for six
weeks of public gatherings and
appearances before congressional
committees to drum up support
for the Pickers' cause.
"We cannot win this on our
homeground. We know that. We
ask your help to extend the strike.
"It is my firm conviction that
banded together we shall bring
justice to the tortured valleys of
our land," he said.
Chavez said the strike centers
around the issues of wages and
health safety measures for the
pickers. Specifically he said pes
ticides on grapes affect over 80
percent of the pickers in his native
Delano, California.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale,
D-Minn., chairman of the migra
tory labor subcommittee told the
crowd the strike and accompany
ing consumers' boycott of grapes
represents "a revolution against
powerlessness, and the anomaly of
poverty in our rich land."
. Dubcek Ousted
PRAGUE (AP) —Alexander
Dubcek, who tried to give com
munism in Czechoslovakia a
"human face," was ousted from
his party's inner circle Sunday in a
major overhaul of the Communist
party and government by the new
pro-Soviet leadership.
A purge list also showed that
29 men who backed Dubcek while
he ran the nation from January to
August last year have left the
Central Committee, the second
highest organ in the party.

At the same time, President
Ludvik Svoboda announced a
Cabinet shakeup in which nine
members were unseated or had
their jobs abolished. The new
government will be sworn in
Monday.
Then, in another move in a day
filled with political activity, the
Communist party made Dubcek's
1968 reform regime the scapegoat
for the Soviet invasion last year. It
said the invasion "was under no
circumstances an act of aggression
against the people, nor was it an
occupation of Czechoslovak ter
ritory or a suppression of freedom
and Socialist order in our state."
Gustav Husak, who succeeded
Dubcek as Communist party chief
in April, said in a speech released
Sunday night that the weekend
party and government purges
should serve as an example for
action needed in all areas of
Czechoslovak life from top to
bottom.
In the speech, made during the
three days of closed Central
Committee meetings last week,
Husak said: "It is necessary to
review the party apparatus from
the central bodies to the lowest so
that right-wing opportunism does
not find refuge . . . The same line
should be adopted in social
organizations, state and economic
apparatus, science and culture."
With the ouster of Dubcek
from the ruling party Presidium,
Svoboda and iVemier Oldrich
Cernik became the ranking of
ficials remaining from the brief
reform era.

. Dubcek Ousted
PRAGUE (AP) —Alexander
Dubcek, who tried to give com
munism in Czechoslovakia a
"human face," was ousted from
his party's inner circle Sunday in a
major overhaul of the Communist
party and government by the new
pro-Soviet leadership.
A purge list also showed that
29 men who backed Dubcek while
he ran the nation from January to
August last year have left the
Central Committee, the second
highest organ in the party.

At the same time, President
Ludvik Svoboda announced a
Cabinet shakeup in which nine
members were unseated or had
their jobs abolished. The new
government will be sworn in
Monday.
Then, in another move in a day
filled with political activity, the
Communist party made Dubcek's
1968 reform regime the scapegoat
for the Soviet invasion last year. It
said the invasion "was under no
circumstances an act of aggression
against the people, nor was it an
occupation of Czechoslovak ter
ritory or a suppression of freedom
and Socialist order in our state."
Gustav Husak, who succeeded
Dubcek as Communist party chief
in April, said in a speech released
Sunday night that the weekend
party and government purges
should serve as an example for
action needed in all areas of
Czechoslovak life from top to
bottom.
In the speech, made during the
three days of closed Central
Committee meetings last week,
Husak said: "It is necessary to
review the party apparatus from
the central bodies to the lowest so
that right-wing opportunism does
not find refuge . . . The same line
should be adopted in social
organizations, state and economic
apparatus, science and culture."
With the ouster of Dubcek
from the ruling party Presidium,
Svoboda and iVemier Oldrich
Cernik became the ranking of
ficials remaining from the brief
reform era.
LOS ANGELES (AP)-Despite
complaints about zealous inspec
tors peeking into the purses and
lunchboxes of school children and
some travelers to remove and
unbutton some of their clothing
for personal searches, the United
States said Sunday it has been
successful with its Mexican border
crackdown on drug smuggling.
The week-long crackdown saw
1,824 of the 1.98 million people
checked at border stations under
going personal searches, only 33
persons arrested and 405 seizures
of an unspecified amount of
marijuana and drugs.
In the personal searches,
government spokesmen said, some
women are required to remove
their jackets and unbutton their
blouses and some men are forced
to take off jackets and vests and

loosen their clothing so the
garmets can be inspected.
The Mexican vice counsul at
Brownsville, Tex., filed a protest
after he and his wife were
stopped.
The search is part of Operation
Intercept, which has dropped
what some people now call a
"grass curtain" across the 2,000
mile border from the Pacific Coast
to the Gulf of Mexico.
Travelers are complaining of
long delays as the inspectors
search virtually everything and
everyone crossing the border.
Mexican and American border
town businessmen agree that
stopping drug traffic is a noble
cause, but said tying up auto
traffic for one to six hours is
disastrous.

WASHINGTON (AP)-Cesar
Chavez said Sunday night a
wicked combination of the De
fense Department and big agricul
tural interests is keeping alive the
California grape pickers strike.
Speaking from the pulpit of the
National Cathedral, the 42-year
old Mexican American told 2,000
supporters the four-year old strike
would end almost immediately if
the Pentagon would stop buying
grapes.
Chavez said sale of table grapes
has decreased 30 percent since the
strike began September 1965.
"What's happening to that 30
percent?," Chavez asked. Me said
more grapes are going into fruit
cocktail, more are being used as
raisins, and the Defense depart-

ment is buying over 40 percent
more than it used to.
Chavez is in the East for six
weeks of public gatherings and
appearances before congressional
committees to drum up support
for the Pickers' cause.
"We cannot win this on our

LOS ANGELES (AP)-Despite
complaints about zealous inspec
tors peeking into the purses and
lunchboxes of school children and
some travelers to remove and
unbutton some of their clothing
for personal searches, the United
States said Sunday it has been
successful with its Mexican border
crackdown on drug smuggling.
The week-long crackdown saw
1,824 of the 1.98 million people
checked at border stations under
going personal searches, only 33
persons arrested and 405 seizures
of an unspecified amount of
marijuana and drugs.
In the personal searches,
government spokesmen said, some
women are required to remove
their jackets and unbutton their
blouses and some men are forced
to take off jackets and vests and

loosen their clothing so the
garmets can be inspected.
The Mexican vice counsul at
Brownsville, Tex., filed a protest
after he and his wife were
stopped.
The search is part of Operation
Intercept, which has dropped
what some people now call a
"grass curtain" across the 2,000
mile border from the Pacific Coast
to the Gulf of Mexico.
Travelers are complaining of
long delays as the inspectors
search virtually everything and
everyone crossing the border.
Mexican and American border
town businessmen agree that
stopping drug traffic is a noble
cause, but said tying up auto
traffic for one to six hours is
disastrous.
. Chavez
WASHINGTON (AP)-Cesar
Chavez said Sunday night a
wicked combination of the De
fense Department and big agricul
tural interests is keeping alive the
California grape pickers strike.
Speaking from the pulpit of the
National Cathedral, the 42-year
old Mexican American told 2,000
supporters the four-year old strike
would end almost immediately if
the Pentagon would stop buying
grapes.
Chavez said sale of table grapes
has decreased 30 percent since the
strike began September 1965.
"What's happening to that 30
percent?," Chavez asked. Me said
more grapes are going into fruit
cocktail, more are being used as
raisins, and the Defense depart-

ment is buying over 40 percent
more than it used to.
Chavez is in the East for six
weeks of public gatherings and
appearances before congressional
committees to drum up support
for the Pickers' cause.
"We cannot win this on our
homeground. We know that. We
ask your help to extend the strike.
"It is my firm conviction that
banded together we shall bring
justice to the tortured valleys of
our land," he said.
Chavez said the strike centers
around the issues of wages and
health safety measures for the
pickers. Specifically he said pes
ticides on grapes affect over 80
percent of the pickers in his native
Delano, California.
Sen. Walter F. Mondale,
D-Minn., chairman of the migra
tory labor subcommittee told the
crowd the strike and accompany
ing consumers' boycott of grapes
represents "a revolution against
powerlessness, and the anomaly of
poverty in our rich land."
. Dubcek Ousted
PRAGUE (AP) —Alexander
Dubcek, who tried to give com
munism in Czechoslovakia a
"human face," was ousted from
his party's inner circle Sunday in a
major overhaul of the Communist
party and government by the new
pro-Soviet leadership.
A purge list also showed that
29 men who backed Dubcek while
he ran the nation from January to
August last year have left the
Central Committee, the second
highest organ in the party.

At the same time, President
Ludvik Svoboda announced a
Cabinet shakeup in which nine
members were unseated or had
their jobs abolished. The new
government will be sworn in
Monday.
Then, in another move in a day
filled with political activity, the
Communist party made Dubcek's
1968 reform regime the scapegoat
for the Soviet invasion last year. It
said the invasion "was under no
circumstances an act of aggression
against the people, nor was it an
occupation of Czechoslovak ter
ritory or a suppression of freedom
and Socialist order in our state."
Gustav Husak, who succeeded
Dubcek as Communist party chief
in April, said in a speech released
Sunday night that the weekend
party and government purges
should serve as an example for
action needed in all areas of
Czechoslovak life from top to
bottom.
In the speech, made during the
three days of closed Central
Committee meetings last week,
Husak said: "It is necessary to
review the party apparatus from
the central bodies to the lowest so
that right-wing opportunism does
not find refuge . . . The same line
should be adopted in social
organizations, state and economic
apparatus, science and culture."
With the ouster of Dubcek
from the ruling party Presidium,
Svoboda and iVemier Oldrich
Cernik became the ranking of
ficials remaining from the brief
reform era.
