# Satire And Song Part Of Gaieties
## 
### 
Plans have been brewing all
summer for the traditional Fall
quarter production of "Gaieties,"
which celebrates the ancient foot
ball feud with University of
California across the bay.
For more than fifty years the
show has been comprised of short
skits satirizing campus life, but
more recently it has become a
full-scale musical comedy, entirely
student written and produced.
Wumberlogue, a fantasy extra
vaganza, delighted the audience in
1967 and won the Broadcast
Musical Show Award for that
year. Previous Gaieties have
featured a local version of James
Bond, a malignant talking
computer, a skatter-brained Mata
Hari, as well as our own beloved
Hoover Tower.
This year's Gaieties promises to
deal with more immediate sub
jects on campus than comical
intrigue. The Carnival Down
Below, by Alan Mokler, with
music by Mokler and Gary
Levinson, presents something to
its audiences —and its cast—deeper
than a charming souffle about Big
Game.
"The concept of an enormous
chorus-line musical is passe,"
explained the author, and so The
Carnival Down Below will work
with a smaller, more manageable
cast, and a more closely-woven
story, in which the songs are an
important part of the action.
The plot of this year's show
revolves around the fate of one
Jack Trent, freshman. Having
fallen in love with an upperclass
girl, he finds himself an unwitting
revolutionary on campus and then
in much trouble with his draft
board—which just happens to be
in Orange County, the red, white,
and blue heart of California
conservatism.
His friend Charlie Bates, arch
typical Resident Assistant, tries to
help and only adds to the
confusion. Charlie is having his
own problems, of course, avoiding
being drawn into the world of the
Organization Man.
Other characters include Leon
Mumper, of the Administration;
Earnest Simgood, a member of
the Orange County draft board;
Cutie, a hitchhiking revolutionary
in the cause of more than equal
sex rights for women; Karl Brown,
a campus radical who drives a
Porsche; and Marnie, a hippie who
drops out. Each reflect a part of
the kaleidoscope of life in the
Stanford Community.
Music is an integral part of
every Gaieties, and the award

winning team of Mokler and
Levinson have created a dozen or
so songs which span every mood,
from the cry "We want a Revolu
tion" to Charlie's mood song
"Wait for the Echo."
There are none of the large
scale chorus numbers of previous
Gaieties, which tended at times to
be clumsy and to detract from
the story. Their place has been
taken by multi-media effects,
using slides, music, and recorded
happenings on Quad.
There are an unlimited number
of participatory roles for stage
struck students. In addition to
actors, singers, and dancers on
stage, there are always carpenters,
seamstresses, script girls, stage
managers, and little bodies who
fetch a coke for the director.
Enthusiasm rather than talent is a
prime prerequisite for involve
ment. After work, there are
occasional beer gatherings, as well
as parties every Friday, and the
gala opening night champagne
party.
If you are interested in theater,
or just want to meet people and
have fun, stop by tryouts,
September 29, 30, and October 1,
from 7:30 to 10 p.m., on Main
Stage in Memorial Auditorium or
leave your name at the Ram's
Head office upstairs in the
Tresidder Union.
