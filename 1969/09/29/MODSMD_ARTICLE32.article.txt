Alpha Phi Omega, Stanford's
National Service Fraternity, is
again holding its Book Exchange
in the A-Phi-O office at Alvarado
House. Over 1,200 textbooks,
including science, art, history, and
social science as well as the latest
fiction, collected last spring are
offered to students at reduced
prices this week.
Students may also contract
with A-Phi-O to sell books at the
Exchange. After sellers price their
books, they are arranged accord
ing to subject for sale. A-Phi-O
handles all the bookkeeping and
owners receive a check when the
book is sold.
Proceeds from the Book Ex
change will help finance other
A-Phi-O services such as Bike
Registration, Boy Scout Troop 1
at the Children's Convalescent
Hospital, and youth projects in
the community.
The Exchange hours are 10
a.m. to 5 p.m. today through
October 3.
