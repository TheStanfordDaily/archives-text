# Campus Groups Support Nationwide Vietnam Protest
## 
### MARSHALL KILDUFF 
Beginning with a leaflet in
today's registration packet, plans
to link student opposition to the
Vietnam war with the national
"Vietnam Moratorium" on Octo
ber 15, will begin to take shape.
Students will be asked to spend
that day discussing the war with
people in Mid-Peninsula communi
ties. At the same time a bipartisan
group of senators and congress
men in Washington will attempt a
anti-war filibuster to draw atten
tion to legislation demanding
troop withdrawal deadlines.
The Moratorium Committee
here is headed by Prof. Martin
Perl of SLAC, Prof. Martin
Carnoy of the School of Educa
tion, and Pat Shea of the ASSU
Council of Presidents. At an
organizational meeting Friday,
Carnoy emphasized that the com
mittee will attempt to include
high school students and adults
from the area as well as students
and faculty here.
The registration packet hand
out from the committee an
nounces the Oct. 15 plans, which
will be organized in part through
the ASSU office. The statement
says that "We, ourselves, must
now undertake, again, the task of
moving others to assume respon
sibility for their own lives and for
the leadership of the country.
"We must convince them,
through action, not words, that
the traditional institutions we
have counted on to end this
international injustice, are no
lorger working adequately."
The Stanford effort will tie in
with similar actions at other
colleges around the country. A
Statement signed by Shea, Daily
editor Mark Weinberger, and 500
other student leaders in the nation

supports the Oct. 15 action
declaring, "It is necessary for all
those who desire peace to become
active again and help bring pres
sure to bear on the present
Administration."
In Washington, opponents of
the war from both parties have
ignored President Nixon's request
for patience and acceptance of his
war policies. 24 Democrats from
both Houses met Friday to draft a
resolution similar to he one
presented by Sen. Charles Goodell
(Rep.-N.Y.). Earlier Goodell had
sponsored a measure asking that
all American troops be withdrawn
by the end of 1970.
The Democrats plan to intro
duce their statement on Oct. 8,
one week before the planned
university boycotts, and endorse
the student move.
A full page ad in yesterday's
New York Times supporting the
moratorium was signed by Caesar
Chavez, leader of the Delano
grape boycott, Dr. Benjamin
Spock, John Kenneth Galbraith,
two former aides of Robert
Kennedy, and Senators Goodell,
Eugene McCarthy, Mark Hatfield,
and George McGovern, among
others.
The text of the statement
endorsed "students and faculty all
over American (who) will leave
their classes for 1 day to ring
doorbells and talk to their fellow

Americans about the madness of
Vietnam."
Twenty members of the Stan
ford faculty have released a
statement calling for support of
the committee. Included on the
list of signers were Chairman of
the Sociology Department San
ford Dornbusch, Dean of the
Chapel B. Davie Napier, and Prof.
Charles Drekmeier of political
science.
Organizer Carnoy hopes that by
Oct. 15 there will be "a couple of
hundred faculty involved in our
project." Students will be organ
ized by dormitories to go to areas

near campus for door-to-door
discussions of the war. There will
be a march in Palo Alto and a
meeting in Memorial Church
featuring Rep. Pete McCloskey
and other speakers.
Shea hopes that between 40
and 60 per cent of the student
body will involve itself in the
moratorium activities. If the Oct.
15 action proves successful, there
will be a three-day protest in
November with 2 days of house
to-house talks and a final day of
rallies and vigils. Additionally,
there are plans for a four day
program in December.
