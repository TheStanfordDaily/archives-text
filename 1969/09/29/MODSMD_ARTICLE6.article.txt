# Frosh Colloquium
## Individuality Stressed 
### MARIAN JOHNSTON 
"You must rebel at every level
if you are not to be stripped of
your individuality," Psychology
professor Philip Zimbardo warned
freshmen Friday morning.
The emphasis on individual
responsibility and freedom of
choice was reflected, too, by the
other speakers in the colloquium
held in Memorial Auditorium.
Professor Wolfgang Panofsky,
director of the Stanford Linear
Accelerator, spoke of the need for
those in universities "to preserve
teaching and research in directions
governed by individual initiative."
He believes military technology
can and must be controlled by
political decision-making, and
urged students to work "to direct
technology into constructive
channels" by influencing the po
litical process.
John Grube, member of the
ASSU Council of Presidents,
centered his remarks on the
increased opportunities in under
graduate education at Stanford
this year. He told students "to
define for themselves a more
personal approach to education."
Something is Wrong
The freshman audience
responded appreciatively as Zim
bardo recalled his own first
reactions to Stanford. "Will I
make it? What if I'm not as good
as they think I am?" Then he
offered a syllogism to calm their
fears: "If Stanford were a flawless
paradise, I wouldn't be here. But I
am here. Ergo, there must be
something wrong with Stanford."
What is wrong with Stanford,
Zimbardo continued, is that life
becomes self-contented and con
trolled, and that "cynicism be
comes suntanned." Once this
occurs, the results are "intel
lectual lethargy, social apathy,
and political indifference." The
prevailing concept becomes
"Don't rock the cradle too hard,
or little Leland might awake."
Zimbardo urged students to
escape controls and reject the

threats to their individuality.
"Freedom can only be asserted
through choice and knowledge,"
he said. "The free man permits no
limits on his choice."
America's only hope, he added,
is in the youth who "take a stand
against the easy life." He called
upon everyone to "reach out,
love, and make real human con
tact with your brothers."
Suggested Action
Panofsky urged students to
disprove the idea that technology
has gone so far that it is
controlling man's life. "There is
nothing 'inexorable' about this
progress," he said.
But he said that "It is in the
political arena that the application
(of technology) can and should be
controlled."
He objects to "the onslaught of
the radicals against the university
towards directing its research into
constructive social action" be
cause this interferes with the
freedom universities preserve
"against external political pres
sures." Panofsky believes student
efforts at redirecting technology

should concentrate on the politi
cal process.
World problems such as over
population and hunger, pollution,
and transportation cannot be
solved without "constructive use
of science and technology,"
Panofsky concluded. "What is
needed is a reorientation of the
purpose of technology: the center
of application of science should
be moved away from the ex
ploitation of natural resources to
conservation."
Grube concluded with a warn
ing that "education often leads to
confusion rather than clarity."
Following the speeches, the
freshmen moved into small dis
cussion groups (numbered 1 to
153—find your tree). Many sun
tanned their cynicism in Frost
Amphitheater, or other grassy
nooks around campus, and asked
upperclassmen about every topic
from the demonstrations and
sit-ins last spring to the abundance
of dogs roaming the campus.
In the evening the groups went
to faculty homes for dinner and
further discussion. ...
