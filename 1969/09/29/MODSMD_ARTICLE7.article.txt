# SWOPSI
## New Courses 
### Tim Coburn 
Looking through the last ten or
twenty years of Stanford course
directories gives one a sense of
history. The rise and fall of
individual course offerings rests
on a background of growth and
expansion. Courses "to be offered
alternate years" are never offered
as if "alternate years" never seem
to arrive. A departed faculty
member? New faculty members
start a new course within a
department; a sub-department
arises and then splits off the old,
hesitantly at first and then with
increasing vigor, proliferating
regulations, requirements, and
more pages in the directory.
Empires are built, and occasion
ally decay.
The most recent trend in
educational diversity is undoubt
edly a bureaucratic nightmare:
interdisciplinary courses and
programs, black studies in history,
sociology, and anthropology,
urban studies programs and ex
perimental colleges. An informant
who preferred to remain nameless
has asserted that this is a radical
plot to bring the Universities to a
standstill, deluged in a wave of
paperwork and schizophrenic
registrars. Certainly, Mao noted
the philosophical value of inject
ing exceptions into a well-ordered
assembly line.
This year's exception appears
to be SWOPSI. In spite of its title,
SWOPSI is not a dating game for
consenting adults, a new com
puter macro-language, or a Nobel
prize winning bacteriophage. The
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues have been
organized largely by a group of
graduate students with credit
approved by the committee on
undergraduate studies. These
courses are NOT listed in Stan
ford's course directory; a listing of
the ten courses offered this
quarter is available at a registra
tion table or at the ASSU office.
The brochure is identifiable by
the strangely familiar posterior
view of a faculty member on the
back cover.
Course Listings
The following brief summary of
the course listings gives some idea
of their interdisciplinary nature:
1. Arms Control and I
ament
2. Privacy in The Computer
Age
3. Research Policy and Society
4. Health Services or Lack
Thereof
5. The Pescadero Dam Project
6. Logging Policy in California
7. Industrialization and
Housing in the Mid-peninsula
8. Jobs in Areas of Social
Concern
9. Scientific Decision Making
in Washington
10. Air Pollution in the S.F.
Bay Area
The graduate students organ
izing SWOPSI are a motly collec
tion of concerned disciplines.
Their intent is to force social
science problems on technolog
ically oriented students, and vice
versa. "The implied independence
of these two general approaches,
as reflected in the Stanford course
catalog, is a relic of academic
inertia. The careers of today's
students will depend on their
understanding of both social and
technical problems."
The faculty sponsors are equal
ly diverse, ranging from Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC to
George Kaplan, an assistant pro
fessor in Psychology. It is not
clear how active a role the faculty
members will play in each work
shop. In general, they would
prefer to be used as resources for
the students involved. This ap
proach seems more like the
English tutorial system than the
classical American pattern of
lectures and tests.
Program Design
According to Joel Primack, one
of the graduate student organ
izers, "The format of the work
shops is designed to produce more
Ralph Naders, critical of our
world and capable of evaluating it
with whatever tools are neces
sary." The workshops are clearly
not intended to be gut courses or
bullsessions, although there is no
set procedure for determining
grades, or evaluation of skills. The
social pressure exerted by one's
peers will probably be sufficient
to keep the intellectual content of
the workshops high. The require
ment for individual initiative will
be paramount.
An additional course offering,
SWOPSI-like in nature and organ
ization, has been set up by Roy
Childs in the department of
sociology. It starts this quarter
under the imposing title "Urban
and Environmental Curriculum,
and draws faculty from Political
Science, Sociology, and Engineer
ing Economic Systems. Three
sequential quarter length courses
are listed for the coming year:
Urban Community Behavior,
Urban Design and the Ecosystem,
and The Urban Dweller: Person
ality and Social Participation.
Interested students may contact
Roy through the Sociology De
partment or at Escondido Village.
Interest in new approaches to
education and course material can
be observed at many Universities
throughout the country. The
pattern seems to focus on inter
disciplinary, problem orientec
programs. SWOPSI appears tt

reflect this sort of general trend.
Two significant differences are the
prime role of graduate students in
the organization and running of
the courses, and the lack of any
well developed bureaucracy of
source of funding. According to
Bob Jaffe, a graduate student in
Physics, "SWOPSI has taken the
original intent of S.E.S. and
started to implement it, ignoring
the customary departmental and
administrative hierarchies and
regulations."
To the students, undergraduate
and graduate, SWOPSI offers a
significant increase in the diversity
of education at Stanford. Faculty
and administration will undoubt
edly be very interested to see how
many students from different
backgrounds avail themselves of
this opportunity. The radical
students are convinced that a
young Ralph Nader is really a
Steve Weissman.

Interest in new approaches to
education and course material can
be observed at many Universities
throughout the country. The
pattern seems to focus on inter
disciplinary, problem orientec
programs. SWOPSI appears tt

reflect this sort of general trend.
Two significant differences are the
prime role of graduate students in
the organization and running of
the courses, and the lack of any
well developed bureaucracy of
source of funding. According to
Bob Jaffe, a graduate student in
Physics, "SWOPSI has taken the
original intent of S.E.S. and
started to implement it, ignoring
the customary departmental and
administrative hierarchies and
regulations."
To the students, undergraduate
and graduate, SWOPSI offers a
significant increase in the diversity
of education at Stanford. Faculty
and administration will undoubt
edly be very interested to see how
many students from different
backgrounds avail themselves of
this opportunity. The radical
students are convinced that a
young Ralph Nader is really a
Steve Weissman.
(Tim Coburn is a graduate
student in genetics and is an
on-campus coordinator for the

Looking through the last ten or
twenty years of Stanford course
directories gives one a sense of
history. The rise and fall of
individual course offerings rests
on a background of growth and
expansion. Courses "to be offered
alternate years" are never offered
as if "alternate years" never seem
to arrive. A departed faculty
member? New faculty members
start a new course within a
department; a sub-department
arises and then splits off the old,
hesitantly at first and then with
increasing vigor, proliferating
regulations, requirements, and
more pages in the directory.
Empires are built, and occasion
ally decay.
The most recent trend in
educational diversity is undoubt
edly a bureaucratic nightmare:
interdisciplinary courses and
programs, black studies in history,
sociology, and anthropology,
urban studies programs and ex
perimental colleges. An informant
who preferred to remain nameless
has asserted that this is a radical
plot to bring the Universities to a
standstill, deluged in a wave of
paperwork and schizophrenic
registrars. Certainly, Mao noted
the philosophical value of inject
ing exceptions into a well-ordered
assembly line.
This year's exception appears
to be SWOPSI. In spite of its title,
SWOPSI is not a dating game for
consenting adults, a new com
puter macro-language, or a Nobel
prize winning bacteriophage. The
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues have been
organized largely by a group of
graduate students with credit
approved by the committee on
undergraduate studies. These
courses are NOT listed in Stan
ford's course directory; a listing of
the ten courses offered this
quarter is available at a registra
tion table or at the ASSU office.
The brochure is identifiable by
the strangely familiar posterior
view of a faculty member on the
back cover.
Course Listings
The following brief summary of
the course listings gives some idea
of their interdisciplinary nature:
1. Arms Control and I
ament
2. Privacy in The Computer
Age
3. Research Policy and Society
4. Health Services or Lack
Thereof
5. The Pescadero Dam Project
6. Logging Policy in California
7. Industrialization and
Housing in the Mid-peninsula
8. Jobs in Areas of Social
Concern
9. Scientific Decision Making
in Washington
10. Air Pollution in the S.F.
Bay Area
The graduate students organ
izing SWOPSI are a motly collec
tion of concerned disciplines.
Their intent is to force social
science problems on technolog
ically oriented students, and vice
versa. "The implied independence
of these two general approaches,
as reflected in the Stanford course
catalog, is a relic of academic
inertia. The careers of today's
students will depend on their
understanding of both social and
technical problems."
The faculty sponsors are equal
ly diverse, ranging from Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC to
George Kaplan, an assistant pro
fessor in Psychology. It is not
clear how active a role the faculty
members will play in each work
shop. In general, they would
prefer to be used as resources for
the students involved. This ap
proach seems more like the
English tutorial system than the
classical American pattern of
lectures and tests.
Program Design
According to Joel Primack, one
of the graduate student organ
izers, "The format of the work
shops is designed to produce more
Ralph Naders, critical of our
world and capable of evaluating it
with whatever tools are neces
sary." The workshops are clearly
not intended to be gut courses or
bullsessions, although there is no
set procedure for determining
grades, or evaluation of skills. The
social pressure exerted by one's
peers will probably be sufficient
to keep the intellectual content of
the workshops high. The require
ment for individual initiative will
be paramount.
An additional course offering,
SWOPSI-like in nature and organ
ization, has been set up by Roy
Childs in the department of
sociology. It starts this quarter
under the imposing title "Urban

catalog, is a relic of academic
inertia. The careers of today's
students will depend on their
understanding of both social and
technical problems."
The faculty sponsors are equal
ly diverse, ranging from Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of SLAC to
George Kaplan, an assistant pro
fessor in Psychology. It is not
clear how active a role the faculty
members will play in each work
shop. In general, they would
prefer to be used as resources for
the students involved. This ap
proach seems more like the
English tutorial system than the
classical American pattern of
lectures and tests.
Program Design
According to Joel Primack, one
of the graduate student organ
izers, "The format of the work
shops is designed to produce more
Ralph Naders, critical of our
world and capable of evaluating it
with whatever tools are neces
sary." The workshops are clearly
not intended to be gut courses or
bullsessions, although there is no
set procedure for determining
grades, or evaluation of skills. The
social pressure exerted by one's
peers will probably be sufficient
to keep the intellectual content of
the workshops high. The require
ment for individual initiative will
be paramount.
An additional course offering,
SWOPSI-like in nature and organ
ization, has been set up by Roy
Childs in the department of
sociology. It starts this quarter
under the imposing title "Urban
and Environmental Curriculum,
and draws faculty from Political
Science, Sociology, and Engineer
ing Economic Systems. Three
sequential quarter length courses
are listed for the coming year:
Urban Community Behavior,
Urban Design and the Ecosystem,
and The Urban Dweller: Person
ality and Social Participation.
Interested students may contact
Roy through the Sociology De
partment or at Escondido Village.
Interest in new approaches to
education and course material can
be observed at many Universities
throughout the country. The
pattern seems to focus on inter
disciplinary, problem orientec
programs. SWOPSI appears tt

reflect this sort of general trend.
Two significant differences are the
prime role of graduate students in
the organization and running of
the courses, and the lack of any
well developed bureaucracy of
source of funding. According to
Bob Jaffe, a graduate student in
Physics, "SWOPSI has taken the
original intent of S.E.S. and
started to implement it, ignoring
the customary departmental and
administrative hierarchies and
regulations."
To the students, undergraduate
and graduate, SWOPSI offers a
significant increase in the diversity
of education at Stanford. Faculty
and administration will undoubt
edly be very interested to see how
many students from different
backgrounds avail themselves of
this opportunity. The radical
students are convinced that a
young Ralph Nader is really a
Steve Weissman.
(Tim Coburn is a graduate
student in genetics and is an
on-campus coordinator for the
Mid-Peninsula Free University)
Looking through the last ten or
twenty years of Stanford course
directories gives one a sense of
history. The rise and fall of
individual course offerings rests
on a background of growth and
expansion. Courses "to be offered
alternate years" are never offered
as if "alternate years" never seem
to arrive. A departed faculty
member? New faculty members
start a new course within a
department; a sub-department
arises and then splits off the old,
hesitantly at first and then with
increasing vigor, proliferating
regulations, requirements, and
more pages in the directory.
Empires are built, and occasion
ally decay.
The most recent trend in
educational diversity is undoubt
edly a bureaucratic nightmare:
interdisciplinary courses and
programs, black studies in history,
sociology, and anthropology,
urban studies programs and ex
perimental colleges. An informant
who preferred to remain nameless
has asserted that this is a radical
plot to bring the Universities to a
standstill, deluged in a wave of
paperwork and schizophrenic
registrars. Certainly, Mao noted
the philosophical value of inject
ing exceptions into a well-ordered
assembly line.
This year's exception appears
to be SWOPSI. In spite of its title,
SWOPSI is not a dating game for
consenting adults, a new com
puter macro-language, or a Nobel
prize winning bacteriophage. The
Stanford Workshops on Political
and Social Issues have been
organized largely by a group of
graduate students with credit
approved by the committee on
undergraduate studies. These
courses are NOT listed in Stan
ford's course directory; a listing of
the ten courses offered this
quarter is available at a registra
tion table or at the ASSU office.
The brochure is identifiable by
the strangely familiar posterior
view of a faculty member on the
back cover.
Course Listings
The following brief summary of
the course listings gives some idea
of their interdisciplinary nature:
1. Arms Control and I
ament
2. Privacy in The Computer
Age
3. Research Policy and Society
4. Health Services or Lack
Thereof
5. The Pescadero Dam Project
6. Logging Policy in California
7. Industrialization and
Housing in the Mid-peninsula
8. Jobs in Areas of Social
Concern
9. Scientific Decision Making
in Washington
10. Air Pollution in the S.F.
Bay Area
The graduate students organ
izing SWOPSI are a motly collec
tion of concerned disciplines.
Their intent is to force social
science problems on technolog
ically oriented students, and vice
versa. "The implied independence
of these two general approaches,
