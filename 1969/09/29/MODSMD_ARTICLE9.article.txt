## Reply To Weissman 
### 
Editor, The DAILY:
In the new Chaparral, Mr. Steve
Weissman has written an article
about the A.C.E. Freshman
Survey which is calculated to
arouse the anxieties of Stanford
freshmen that their responses to
the survey might at some time or
in some way be used against them.
While I hope to have an
opportunity to reply later to Mr.
Weissman's misleading report, I
want to assure Stanford freshmen
that they are absolutely free to fill
out the questionnaires anon
ymously or to omit any items
which they regard as offensive. We

have also suggested to the A.C.E.
that they redesign their follow-up
studies so that in the future they
do not require student names on
questionnaires.
The data obtained on Stanford
freshmen from these surveys have
been and can be useful in bringing
about needed change and im
provement here, but these bene
fits can accrue equally well with
anonymous responses. We hope
very much that freshmen will not
be panicked by Mr. Weissman's
conspiratorial view of what is
really an honest attempt to
understand student attitudes and

needs more clearly.

Editor, the DAILY:
We are informed of a student
who desired to attend Stanford
Summer Session on limited
means. After hitchhiking to
California and paying $320
tuition this student found he had
insufficient funds for room and
board. This was in part due to
ambiguities in the Stanford cata
logue. Feeling that education vns
the right of all he therefore
determined to complete the
summer course at the expense of
Stanford.
This was accomplished by living
in the dormitory with a friend,
and taking dormitory meals under
an assumed name. We estimate
that he was able to sustain himself
on $300, courtesy of Stanford.
This student has expressed to
us his regrets at having in fact
"stolen" this money. He does not,
however, feel any remorse at
having stolen this money from
Stanford. According to his theory
education, housing, board, and
clothing are the rights of all men.
Since Stanford is an institution
which denied him these rights,
and systematically denies them to
a large sector of the population,
this minor theft with its attendant
guilt feelings is not only justified,
but necessary.
We found that lengthy discus
sion of this incident has consider
ably radicalized this student's
(and ours) social and political
views. We therefore suggest (some
of us demand) that Stanford
abolish all fees, that students be
admitted on the basis of 'educable
potential,' that Stanford house,
feed, clothe the students admit
ted; and that further Stanford
supply the students with all
material necessary for the com
pletion of their education.

questionnaires.
The data obtained on Stanford
freshmen from these surveys have
been and can be useful in bringing
about needed change and im
provement here, but these bene
fits can accrue equally well with
anonymous responses. We hope
very much that freshmen will not
be panicked by Mr. Weissman's
conspiratorial view of what is
really an honest attempt to
understand student attitudes and

needs more clearly.

We are informed of a student
who desired to attend Stanford
Summer Session on limited
means. After hitchhiking to
California and paying $320
tuition this student found he had
insufficient funds for room and
board. This was in part due to
ambiguities in the Stanford cata
logue. Feeling that education vns
the right of all he therefore
determined to complete the
summer course at the expense of
Stanford.
This was accomplished by living
in the dormitory with a friend,
and taking dormitory meals under
an assumed name. We estimate
that he was able to sustain himself
on $300, courtesy of Stanford.
This student has expressed to
us his regrets at having in fact
"stolen" this money. He does not,
however, feel any remorse at
having stolen this money from
Stanford. According to his theory
education, housing, board, and
clothing are the rights of all men.
Since Stanford is an institution
which denied him these rights,
and systematically denies them to
a large sector of the population,
this minor theft with its attendant
guilt feelings is not only justified,
but necessary.
We found that lengthy discus
sion of this incident has consider
ably radicalized this student's
(and ours) social and political
views. We therefore suggest (some
of us demand) that Stanford
abolish all fees, that students be
admitted on the basis of 'educable
potential,' that Stanford house,
feed, clothe the students admit
ted; and that further Stanford
supply the students with all
material necessary for the com
pletion of their education.

In the new Chaparral, Mr. Steve
Weissman has written an article
about the A.C.E. Freshman
Survey which is calculated to
arouse the anxieties of Stanford
freshmen that their responses to
the survey might at some time or
in some way be used against them.
While I hope to have an
opportunity to reply later to Mr.
Weissman's misleading report, I
want to assure Stanford freshmen
that they are absolutely free to fill
out the questionnaires anon
ymously or to omit any items
which they regard as offensive. We

have also suggested to the A.C.E.
that they redesign their follow-up
studies so that in the future they
do not require student names on
questionnaires.
