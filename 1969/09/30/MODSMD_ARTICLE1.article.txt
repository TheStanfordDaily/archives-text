# Pitzer Warns Of Dangers In Continued Nuclear Tests
##

â– w

The safety of all mankind
would be best served by
postponing megaton nuclear tests
and by initiating an open review
of all aspects of nuclear testing,
Stanford President Kenneth Pitzer
declared yesterday.
Speaking before the Senate
Foreign Relations Committee,
Pitzer and other scientists warned
that a proposed series of
underground nuclear tests in
Alaska may cause disastrous
earthquakes and seriously damage
international relations.
Pitzer, Jack Oliver, geology
professor at Columbia's
Lamont-Doherty Geological
Observatory and Franklin Long,
Cornell University vice-president

supported a bill to delay the
Amchitka Island tests pending
further investigation and
discussion.
Oliver declared that an
underground test in the Aleutian
Islands might cause earthquakes
and tidal waves "which would
endanger coastal inhabitants and
dwellings throughout much of the
Pacific."
Pitzer spoke to the committee
shortly after release of an ad hoc
panel's report expressing serious
concern over the earthquake
hazards stemming from the
megaton tests.
Pitzer headed the panel study,
which was conducted under the
auspices of the Office of Science

and Technology in collaboration
with the President's Science
Advisory Committee.
Its findings, reported to
President Johnson in late
November 1968, had been
restricted "for official use" until
this weekend.
Pitzer called release of the
report "better late than never,"
noting that he had repeatedly
urged that it be released to the
public. In a major speech to the
American Chemical Society last
April, Pitzer called for "a much
more substantial public hearing"
before further large underground
nuclear tests in Nevada and the
Aleutian Islands.
After informing the Committee
that he had served as director of
research for the U.S. Atomic
Energy Commission (AEC) after
World War 11, Pitzer delcared that
''although my direct
responsibilities were not in the
weapons area, I supported the
vigorous weapons research
program.
"But as events in Korea and
Vietnam as well as the recent
ABM debate have made
abundantly clear, the situation is
now very different, and 1 do not
believe that there has been
adequate corresponding change in
our policies. Our massive nuclear
armament is essentially
neutralized by that of the
U.S.S.R. The totality of nuclear
weapons of the world hover as a
threat over all mankind. Our
present array of strategic weapons
will deter any rational attack.
"In my view, we should give a
higher priority to our efforts in
arms control and in nuclear
non-proliferation than to the
further refinement of nuclear
warheads.
''But we appear to be
proceeding full speed as if at top
priority on this risky program of
large underground nuclear tests
while our steps toward nuclear
arms control are either leisurely or
hesitant.
"If this is the impression that
we give to other countries, we
may jeopardize the nuclear
non-proliferation treaty as well as

other possible prospects for
nuclear arms control.
"Thus, in my judgement, both
the long-range safety of all
mankind as well as the immediate
safety of those in central Nevada,
in Alaska, and on the coast of the
north Pacific would be better
served by postponing megaton
nuclear tests at this time and by
initiating an open, broad-based
review of all aspects of this
situation."
The general Stanford campus
reaction to Pitzer's remarks before
the committee was highly
favorable. Prof. Wolfgang
Panofsky, director of the Stanford
Linear Accelerator (SLAC), said
that he was "delighted to hear
President Pitzer's statement.
"It took courage and stamina
to give the testimony before
Congress. His concern over
priorities is certainly valid,"
Panofsky said.
Martin Perl, professor at
SLAC, felt that now expert
testimony cast doubt on the
advisability of the tests, they
should definitely be postponed.
"If the experts are worried, then
we should be really worried.
These are the guys who know,"
concluded Perl.
