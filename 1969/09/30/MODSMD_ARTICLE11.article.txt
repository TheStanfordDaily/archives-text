# From the Underground
## Back at Stanford 
### Brad Cornell John Spiegel 
Back at Stanford. Five
thousand miles on a motorcycle
to return to our valley of
plenty—the land of infinite
diversions.
Back at Stanford.
Encompassed by the beauty of

the place—the rolling hills, blue
sky, mild climate, soft breezes.
Gone are the humid
oppressiveness of the Mississippi
delta, the barren peaks of the
Rocky mountains, the scorching
desolation of the California

desert. Back at Stanford all is
mellow and serene.
And the serenity engulfs us all,
molding our minds and bodies.
Gone is the weathered face of the
black cotton picker, replaced by
the smile of a sun-tanned coed as
she hurries off to a pre-reg
meeting. The blatant greed of the
Southern motel manager is also
gone, supplanted by the
magnanimity of the well paid
administrator. Even the suspicious
cop has disappeared to be
replaced by a "private" police
force.
Optimistic Humanism
The words have changed
too—become honeyed. Instead of
the abrupt hostility of the small
town gas station attendant,
"Eighty cents mistah," we are
presented with the optimistic
humanism of those who can
afford luxury; "education is a
process of constant personal
growth, a striving toward new
levels of freedom and awareness."
But back at Stanford these
words of growth seem strangely
hollow, produndly suspect. They
reflect more our hope, a hope for
growth without suffering, insight
without pain —the bland
expectation that "personal
growth" can come from a
morning colloquy in the sun with
half dozen fellow students.
Back in my room at Stanford.
Tormented by the words of Bob
Dylan. Filled with a longing for
the road, for faces hardened and
cleansed of pretense by the strain
of life. Yet aware that I am not
welcome among these faces.
Aware that characteristics
developed in a white suburb,
characteristics lauded and
nurtured at Stanford, are out of
place and unwanted in a bar in
Bellzoni, Mississippi.
Back at Stanford. Haunted by
the realization that here, beneath
the rolling hills and amidst the
honeyed words, my roots lie.
Here, if anywhere, the product of
affluent America should be at
home, at peace, and yet I am not.
