## Violence Is Taxable 
### Art Buchwald 
My friend McCormick thinks
he has an answer to all the
violence in movies and on
television.
"Tax the hell out of them," he
said.
"But how?" I asked.
"You sell licenses to producers
of movies and television shows.
They'd be like a hunting permit.
You wouldn't be allowed to I*:!?
anyone in a TV program or a film
without first buying a license. It
would cost you $1,000 to kill one
man, $2,000 to kill a woman and
$5,000 if you wanted to kill a
child."
"Would you have a limit on
how many people you could
bag?"
"Not at the beginning. I think
a producer could kill as many
people as he wanted to, providing
he had a license for each one."
"What about the method of
killing people in movies and TV?"
"We might add a surcharge for
unorthodox methods of killing,
such as burning, garroting and
throwing them off buildings. But I
believe shooting or stabbing
should be permitted for the
straight $1,000 fee."
"McCormick, your idea has
great merit, but it seems to me it
would add tremendous costs to
cowboy pictures."
"Exactly. I believe the
producers of cowboy films and
TV shows would have to be very
discriminating in whom they
killed. It will stop them from
shooting everyone within camera
range. If, for example, a producer
had only three licenses, he'd have
to choose his victims pretty
carefully."

"It would certainly save a lot
of Indians from being killed," I
said.
"As far as war pictures are
concerned, we might make a
package deal. For a flat $100,000
the producers would be permitted
to wipe out either one World War
II German battalion or sink one
Japanese aircraft carrier with all
personnel on board."
"Would you require licenses
for wounding and maming people
on TV and in films?"
"I would propose a rate card
starting with knocking out a
person in a fist fight, which would
cost $10, to causing a severe brain
concussion, which would cost the
producer $500. Any open wound
or display of blood would
automatically be taxed an extra
$100."
"It seems to me those prices
are pretty high."
"That's the idea. The only way
you're going to get anyone to cut
down on violence is to hit him
where it hurts —in the
pocketbook."
''At the same time,"
McCormick continued, "I believe
producers of nonviolent films
should be encouraged by receiving
tax rebates. If anyone makes a TV
show or picture in which no one is
either killed or maimed, he
certainly deserves all the tax
advantages he can get."
"You've really thought this
through," I said.
"It's going to be a tough fight
to get it by Congress,"
McCormick said.
"How's that?"
"The pro-violence lobby in
Washington has put out the word
that if anyone taxes violence, he'll
soon be wearing cement shoes."

"You sell licenses to producers
of movies and television shows.
They'd be like a hunting permit.
You wouldn't be allowed to I*:!?
anyone in a TV program or a film
without first buying a license. It
would cost you $1,000 to kill one
man, $2,000 to kill a woman and
$5,000 if you wanted to kill a
child."
"Would you have a limit on
how many people you could
bag?"
"Not at the beginning. I think
a producer could kill as many
people as he wanted to, providing
he had a license for each one."
"What about the method of
killing people in movies and TV?"
"We might add a surcharge for
unorthodox methods of killing,
such as burning, garroting and
throwing them off buildings. But I
believe shooting or stabbing
should be permitted for the
straight $1,000 fee."
"McCormick, your idea has
great merit, but it seems to me it
would add tremendous costs to
cowboy pictures."
"Exactly. I believe the
producers of cowboy films and
TV shows would have to be very
discriminating in whom they
killed. It will stop them from
shooting everyone within camera
range. If, for example, a producer
had only three licenses, he'd have
to choose his victims pretty
carefully."

"It would certainly save a lot
of Indians from being killed," I
said.
"As far as war pictures are
concerned, we might make a
package deal. For a flat $100,000
the producers would be permitted
to wipe out either one World War
II German battalion or sink one
Japanese aircraft carrier with all
personnel on board."
"Would you require licenses
for wounding and maming people
on TV and in films?"
"I would propose a rate card
starting with knocking out a
person in a fist fight, which would
cost $10, to causing a severe brain
concussion, which would cost the
producer $500. Any open wound
or display of blood would
automatically be taxed an extra
$100."
"It seems to me those prices
are pretty high."
"That's the idea. The only way
you're going to get anyone to cut
down on violence is to hit him
where it hurts —in the
pocketbook."
''At the same time,"
McCormick continued, "I believe
producers of nonviolent films
should be encouraged by receiving
tax rebates. If anyone makes a TV
show or picture in which no one is
either killed or maimed, he
certainly deserves all the tax
advantages he can get."
"You've really thought this
through," I said.
"It's going to be a tough fight
to get it by Congress,"
McCormick said.
"How's that?"
"The pro-violence lobby in
Washington has put out the word
that if anyone taxes violence, he'll
soon be wearing cement shoes."
My friend McCormick thinks
he has an answer to all the
violence in movies and on
television.
"Tax the hell out of them," he
said.
"But how?" I asked.
