"The grass is greener on the other side. "
â€”unknown Egyptian poet.
Richard Nixon is getting a bit overzealous. Way
back when he was supporting Spiro Agnew for
Vice-President, Dick promised to "Bring us all
together."
He's certainly done that at the Mexican Border.
There, ten of thousands of Americans have taken
the time to stop and chat with each other, with
discussion groups led by former customs agents.
The discussion invariably turns to drugs. It
seems the government, horrified at the idea that
Marijuana might be kept out of the hands of the
Mafia, has initiated the so-called Operation
Intercept. This action has led to increased
interpersonal contact between travellers, their cars,
and the friendly in-crowd at the border.
The purpose of this combined effort of large
innd, sea, and air forces is to snarl traffic, frustrate
nerves, and, almost incidentally, stop the flow of
heavy drugs from Mexico into the Promised Land.
The major search effort is directed against
marijuana (mar' i-wanne). The close connection
between this narcotic and outrageous, immoral,
and degenerate living has been amply
demonstrated. Its users engage in obscene and
ugly demonstrations against the Vietnam war,
militarism, racism, governmental hypocrisy, bras,
and other federally sponsored projects.
Therefore, with the gracious consent of the
FORGOTTEN AMERICAN, the flow of marijuana
is being staunched. Though there is some
opposition by the LID party (Liberal Independent
Democrats), Operation Intercept has rushed to
action with near total success.
There have been some problems, of course. The
Mexican government is thinking of seceding from

the Union. The fertilizer and weed control
companies are protesting unwarranted government
interference in private enterprize. And one
misguided customs official arrested thirty-eight
girls (all but one from Boisie, Idaho) named Mary
Jane.
Though a bit disjointed, however, the operation
has been fairly successful. In fact, it has not been
without its artistic moments. A sort of living
theatre was formed when over 1800 people
stripped for the benefit of their discussion groups.
Though shocking to residents of nearby Mexican
cities like Tijuana, such behavior does show that
government can foster creativity, even at the
expense of offending the old-fashioned.
There was an initial fear that if marijuana were
to be stopped, youth would turn to higher drugs
such as LSD, DMT, THC, and FXWQ. However,
these premonitions have proved unreal. In greater
numbers each week, kids are taking up getting
drunk and watching TV. Another benign
indication that we are on the road back to
normalcy occured recently at Berkeley, when the
first panty-raid in nearly eight years was staged by
the resurgent fraternities.
President Nixon, calling the first, results of
Operation Interception "the second greatest week
in the history of the world," is expected soon to
make a joint TV appearance with Attorney
General Mitchell. They will announce that the
operation is being extended in scope to catch the
carriers of diseases other than marijuanititis, such
as black rash, urban blight, and militant
collegeremia. If one problem can be so easily
solved, why not others . . .
