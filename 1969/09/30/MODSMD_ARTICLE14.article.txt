It is entitled University Research
Policy and was written as part of
the discussion in last springs
Academic Senate decision to halt
classified research on the Stanford
campus. That decision is to be
reconsidered at the October 3
meeting of the Academic Senate.)
Last spring the policies
governing University research
activities and, in a larger context,
the relationship of the university
to the growing influence of
science and technology, were
called into question. The
discussions which ensued led to
the decision by the Academic
Senate to eliminate secret research
from the campus, a decision to be
reviewed shortly by the Academic
Council. The questions raised,
however, go well beyond the issue
of secret research on the campus.

Especially in the past twenty
years, scientific and technological
knowledge has enromously
increased the powers of man.
However there has not been a
commensurate application of this
knowledge to human betterment
and its potential for destructive
use has appreciably increased.
Amongst the many causes of this
situation, two are particularly
relevant to our subject. The first is
a failure to develop either the
understanding by citizens or the
legal and political practices which
would permit effective public
control over technology.
Scientific and technological
knowledge has become
increasingly difficult for the
average citizen to comprehend. He
becomes less and less capable of
deciding related policy issues. The
expert is called upon to manage
the technological society and the
political power of the citizen
recedes. Very few legal or political
mechanisms have been devised to
protect the rights of the individual
against technological advance or
to ensure public knowledge and
control of its application. The
second is subversion of the
political process by the demands
of technology. Political
democracy requires that citizens
be able to wield effective power
over the forces which influence
their society. It is difficult for
citizens to accomplish this
however because technology has a
momentum of its own which, in
many ways, dictates political
policy. The influence of military
technology on budget and foreign
policy decisions, and the impact
of the automobile on economic
and natural resource decisions, are
two examples. Political
institutions are thereby reduced
to reacting to the demands and
consequences of existing
technological organizations rather
than exercising the initiative
whereby society plans its future.
Many citizens, perceiving their
growing impotence and the
uncertainty of their future, find
fewer reasons for allegiance and
responsibility to the present
system.
Universities and their research
policies contribute substantially
to this situation. They supply
much of the innovation which
underlies the technological
explosion and they train the
technical and managerial
personnel of the future. So
preoccupied are they with these
tasks, and their requirements in
terms of fund generation, facilities
and faculty time, that they often
pay scant attention to alternative
social needs and programs. If the
universities are to be sites for
unbiased learning by the young
and for independent criticism and
contribution to social well-being
by scholars and students, their
current research priorities and
policies must be changed.
Current Policy
Current university research
policy is relatively simple.
Research projects, conceived by
individual faculty members, are
supported by interested donors
who are almost always external to
the university. Individual projects
are rarely discussed within the
university and only occasionally
do faculty members group
together to undertake projects on
the basis of an analysis of the
needs of their discipline or of
society. This policy has been
enormously successful in
developing science and technology
in the past twenty-five years, and
in securing funds whereby the
universities have expanded their
plants, faculties and student
bodies. It also has had
consequences which, in our
opinion, are very dangerous for
the university. These include
reduced control over significant
portions of their activities, partial
subservience to the objectives of
external funding agencies,
decreased attention to many areas
of university responsibilities such
as teaching and non-technical
disciplines, and loss of a sense of
community. While each of these
consequences is relative, their
impact can be seen in many ways.
Over fifty percent of this
university's annual budget, and
approximately ninety percent of
its research budget, are derived
from external sponsors. In various
ways the interests of these
sponsors intrude themselves.
Research proposals are sometimes
tailored to meet the needs of the
sponsor. When large sources of
funding are available, faculty tend
to be recruited and programs
initiated which are capable of
competing successfully for that
funding. Once such faculty and
programs exist, a momentum is
attained which requires further
funding, which militates against a
change in direction of research
which does not utilize the skill of
the faculty team, and which
occupies available space and
faculty positions. At times the
interests of the sponsor are
expressed in terms of
requirements for secrecy or
political clearance of university
personnel which strike directly at
the free flow of ideas. Universities
have not generally concerned
themselves with the consequences,
both potential and actual, of their
actions on behalf of their research
sponsors. They are therefore open
to the charge that, having
contributed to some of the ills of
society, they are not equally
concerned with preventing or
correcting these ills.

Defenses of Policy
Many defenses are made of
existing research policy. That
policy, it is argued, ensures
maximum freedom for individual
faculty members because their
research projects are conceived by
them and they obtain their own
funds. Planning of research by
schools or groups of faculty,
limitations of certain types of
research, and restriction of certain
kinds of external support for
research, are viewed as violations
of academic freedom. In our view
the above argument is invalid. The
composition of research in the
university need not be determined
solely by the action of individual
faculty members. The university
as a whole has a right to develop
particular programs or objectives.
The principle of academic
freedom does not preclude the
right of the university to establish
overall research policy. The broad
social purpose of freedom of
research is to enhance the
common good by guaranteeing a
balance of many points of view.
Nowhere in the original definition
of academic freedom was the right
of the individual investigators to
pursue their interests viewed as
separate from the interests of
society. While underscoring that
freedom in inquiry and exposition
is essential to the advancement of
truth, the statement of principles
on academic freedom and tenure
of the Association of University
Professors states "Institutions of
higher education are conducted
for the common good and not to
further the interest of the
individual teacher or the
institution as a whole". However,
today many universities do not
guarantee facilities for many types
of investigation such as
disarmament, environmental
protection or urban development,
and funds to support such
research are relatively meager. In
order to allow true freedom of
research, and also to protect the
common good, it may be
necessary to cut back certain
excessively developed forms of
research and allow a more
comprehensive investigative effort
to develop.
Another defense holds that
research is a form of expression,
not action, and hence is
guaranteed by the First
Amendment of the Constitution.
This is a position taken by
Stanford University's Committee
on Research Policy. Even if the
First Amendment is considered to
emerge solely from an intrinsic
right for individuals to speak, we
doubt that research is exclusively
a form of expression. However,
the First Amendment may also be
viewed as emerging from the
concept that freedom of speech is
given to individual citizens by the
body politic for a social purpose.
In a democracy, citizens must be
in possession of all relevant
information in order to make final
decisions concerning social
policies. In order to guarantee
that citizens receive the necessary
information, the citizens as a
body give to themselves as
individuals the right to speak.
Freedom of speech guarantees
freedom to learn. One of the
major purposes of the First
Amendment is social and is aimed
at advancing the common
knowledge. In this context, the
right to speak my be limited, as in
restrictions concerning the time
and place of speaking, but the
right to hear a viewpoint may not
be compromised. Transposed into
terms for the scholar, society gives
him freedom to inquire and speak
in order that it might learn.
Speaking of the contract whereby
society grants freedom to the
scholar, Alexander Meiklejohn
commented that "Our final
responsibility, as scholars and
teachers, is not to truth. It is to
the people who need the truth."
In accepting the freedom which
society offers, the scholar would
do well to recognize that this
freedom derives from society and
that there is a social obligation
implicit in its use.
Another argument holds that
the act of acquiring new
knowledge through scientific and
technological means is a pure act
of learning devoid of social or
moral value. The use to which
society puts that knowledge may
be governed by moral standards
but the development of
knowledge should not. Certainly
it is true that an individual cannot
foresee all the uses to which his
new knowledge may be put.
Equally, an individual may have
one objective and his sponsor
another. However, the conduct of
research is a social activity both in
terms of intellectual and financial
support and in terms of influence
on society. In our opinion,
therefore, the scientist, if he
wishes to be free and supported in
his investigative work, must
clearly demonstrate that he is
sensitive and helpful to society in
understanding his quest and the
consequences of the knowledge
which he uncovers. He should also
seek to guarantee that the
institution in which he works,
particularly the university, reflects
in its programs a significant effort
to increase both public knowledge
and public control over
technology and to safeguard both
citizens and the environment from
harm.
