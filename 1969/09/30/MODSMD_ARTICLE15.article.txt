# Police Break Up SDS-aided Protest
## 
### 
More than 20 students from
Stanford and 40 from San Jose
State joined pickets outside the
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel Co.
yesterday morning in Santa Clara.
Several hours later the picket
line of more than 120 workers
and students was broken up by a
police tactical squad that drove
the group away from the lone

entrance to the steel fabrication
plant.
The students, mostly members
of the Students for a Democratic
Society (SDS), were supporting
the 113 man Steel Workers Local
4028 in its bid for a wage increase
and a contract expiration date in
common with the plant's other
unions.

There were no injuries or
arrests. One picket had his glasses
broken when he was bumped by a
car attempting to cross the line.
H. Bruce Franklin, associate
professor of English, who
picketed with the Stanford
students, claims the student
radicals "have been getting along
fantastically well" with the
strikers. SDS members plan to
join the picket line every Monday
morning for an indefinite period,
according to Franklin.
"Most of the workers are more
radical than student radicals in
their analysis of American society.
They know who's on top," he
declared.
At its national meeting this
summer, SDS had announced
plans to try to work among
industrial workers. This project is
an effort "to unite the majority of
the students and ally with workers
against the common oppressor."
In urging students to help the
strikers, Franklin said, "Listen to
these guys. You'll find out things
that they never teach you in class
at Stanford University."

I'alw alarm Sunday night. Someone had sent in the alarm from a box near Stern,
and lite firemen arrived to find no fire.
