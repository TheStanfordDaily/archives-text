# SDS To Meet
## A3M Film Billed 
### WILLIAM CHATFIELD 
The Stanford chapter of
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) will hold its first meeting of
the quarter tonight at 7:30, in
Cubberley Auditorium. On the
agenda are a film of the May 16
SRI-Hanover demonstration,
presented by the April 3rd
Movement (A3M) Legal Defense
Committee, and several
"presentations" on possible
directions for SDS activity this
fall.
Tonight's meeting is planned as
a "program" meeting. According
to an SDS spokesman, it will
involve discussions of the issues
which are open to the local radical
movement. Included among these
are "Woman's Liberation, Labor,
Ecology and Land Use, the War
and Imperialism, and freeing
political prisoners."
There will also be one or two
speakers from the Pittsburgh-Des
Moines Steel strike in San Jose.
Paul Rupert will chair the
meeting.
Last year Stanford SDS
directed most of its activities on
one project—ending the war and
con nterins'.rgency research at
Stanford and SRI. This year,
however, SDS expects to pursue a

large number of projects on and
beyond the Stanford campus.
SDS plans to hold weekly
meetings, alternating business
meetings with theoretical
meetings and educational
programs.
At next week's meeting, the
organization may split up into
"affinity groups." Last Spring the
April Third Movement found that
affinity groups—small groups of
ten to twenty people—effectively
allowed the participation and
discussion impossible at large
meetings.
Stanford SDS participates in a
Northern California Region of
SDS, but its relationship to any of
the "SDS" national organizations
is not clear, and should be
resolved this fall.
