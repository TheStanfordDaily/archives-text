An experimental course
offering community involvement
with academic credit will be open
this fall for students interested in
tutoring high school minority
students. Undergraduate Special
181, conceived by Jim Bower, a
Stanford student in Economics,
provides for the education of both
the tutors and their students in
the area of interracial relations.
Those enrolling in the course
will be working on a one to one
basis with minority students in
grades 9-12 at Gunn High School
and Terman Junior High School.
The first meeting of the course
will be held on October 6 in
room 164 in the Undergraduate
Library.
Students who wish to
participate in the tutoring but do
not want to take the course can
apply for a tutoring post at the
education office in Cubberly.

Sixteen professional journalism
fellowships for the 1969-70
academic year have been awarded

by Stanford University to
reporters and editors in the U.S.
and Canada.
The group, whose age range is
22 to 41, includes 13 from
newspapers (one of them a
weekly), two from television
newsrooms and one from a news
magazine. The new fellows will be
on leave from their jobs to study
anything except journalisrr. during
their stay on the campus. All but
one, who received a three-month
fellowship, will be at Stanford for
six months.
Indicative of the rapid growth
of television news is the fact that
both of the new fellows from
television have had virtually all of
their news experience in that
medium.
One of the fellows is a
Hungarian newspaperman who
escaped to this country during the
1956 revolt, learned English after
his arrival, got a factory job and
rose to foreman. In 1964 he
successfully applied for a
reporting job and now is an
editorial writer.
