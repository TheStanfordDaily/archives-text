# Lambda Nu Upset With Look Article
## 
### JULIE FLEECE 
Lambda Nu, after its first year
as a co-ed fraternity, has gained
national recognition. The
September 23 issue of Look
magazine features an article on
Lambda Nu written by a Look
reporter who spent a week there
last spring.
The general reaction to the
article from members of Lambda
Nu, according to their president
Sue Ott, was that it was "pretty
stupid."
"There's a lot more going on at
Lambda Nu than sex," said Sue.
Several other members agreed that
the story was written from a
somewhat sensational angle to
help sell the magazine.
Article Sensational
One new member of Lambda
Nu thought the start of the article
was sensationa I but that it
balanced out with some
perceptive observations at the
end. He commented that most
articles on co-ed living have
adopted a similar sensational
approach and that he had
expected it.
The end of the article included
comments by a psychologist and a
resident assistant in a co-ed house
on the psychological effects of
co-ed living. They mentioned that
co-ed living seems to de-emphasize
sex and put boy-girl relationships
on a more natural basis.
One of the things the members
found most objectionable was a
picture of Lambda Nu members in
their nighties. While Look's
caption states that they are all
members of Lambda Nu, members
say that there are more
non-members in the picture than
there are members. In fact, many

members refused to be in the
picture with their nightclothes on
because they felt it was an
artificial, contrived situation.
Several other pictures in the
article were candids taken around
the house. Some Lambda Nu
members admitted that the only
thing they liked about the article
was having their pictures in a
national magazine.
Tired of Questions
Members of Lambda Nu seem
somewhat tired of being asked
what living in a co-ed fraternity is
like. Actually, they say, living in
Lambda Nu is very similar to
living in any of the co-ed houses
on campus.
One distinguishing mark of a
fraternity is a selection process for
members. Lambda Nu now
participates in the University draw
system to fill the house with new
members, both boys and girls. The
junior and senior boys now in the
house are the last ones to be
chosen by a positive vote of
Lambda Nu members.
The terminology of the
fraternity has stuck, however.
Officially, there are no "pledges,"
and everyone in the house was at
work the past week, helping clean
up the house. But many of the
other Lambda Nu residents still
call the new members "pledge".
After a full year, Stanford's
first "co-ed fraternity" seems to
be a success. None of the girls
have moved into other on campus
housing, although two moved
off-campus and some went
overseas. In the draw last spring,
many more students asked to live
in Lambda Nu than there were
spaces for in the house.
