# 'Intercept' Action Disrupts Everyone
## 
### CRAIG WILSON 
Its the most expensive grass
killer ever invented.
Undertaken nearly three weeks
ago, Operation Intercept becomes
a gathering place for customs
agents and traffic jams at the
border separating the United
States from Mexico.
The tactic is aimed at cutting
off the supply of marijuana and
other drugs from Mexico. In
recent days border officials have
gone so far as to strip those
making the crossing. Thousands of
travelers are forced to wait in lines
up to six hours long until customs
officials can check them.
The "grass curtain," as it is
being called, began Sept. 22 as the
most intensive such operation in
U.S. peacetime history.
According to officials in
Washington,"the objective of the
program is to reduce the volume
of narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs which are
smuggled into the United States
from Mexico, thus cutting down
the supply available to addicts and
users in this country."
Mitchell and Marijuana
Attorney General John
Mitchell claims that 80 per cent of
the marijuana smoked in the
United States, about 20 per cent
of the heroin used, and an
undetermined volume of illegal
amphetamines enter the country
from Mexico.
Intercept is expected to
continue to an indefinite period
and involves the law enforcement
forces of several branches of the
federal government.
In the meantime hordes of
people will have to wait at the
border until inspectors can search
their bodies and belongings.
Traffic the first day was
backed up for several miles as the
bullfights ended in Tijuana.
Northbound traffic sprawled
across all four lanes of the
highway waiting to fan out into
the 16 inspection lanes.
Inspectors who are specially
trained for the work, went
through cars from hood to trunk,
paying particular attention to
luggage and makeshift parcels and
containers such as cardboard
boxes.
Tequila and Horns
Frustrated motorists have
reacted by blaring their horns for
hours on end while others sit
patiently sipping tequila. There

have been no reports of drunk
driving in the jam.
There have been many
incidents of motorists turning
back or sacks of items being
hurled from cars as they near the
border check.
On the border itself there have
been relatively few people
arrested on smuggling charges and
only a small quantity of drugs
recovered. Only 33 persons have
been arrested out of a total of
nearly two million people
inspected.
But the rationale for the
border check is to prevent
marijuana and drugs from coming
into the United States, not to
make mass arrests, said one
official.
Other officials say they hope
to raise the price of the weed so
high that few can afford it.
Drug Price Increase
California Attorney General
Thomas Lynch thinks that a
successful crackdown on
marijuana will drive its price up
and lead to increased use of other
drugs.
Lynch said recently that charts
of the number of arrests for
marijuana and dangerous drug
offenses in the past ten years
revealed that any change in one
group was accompanied by "an
offsetting reaction" in the other.
The attorney general said 1969
would be a ''dramatic
e x ample "—with arrests for
dangerous drugs catching up and

possibly exceeding marijuana
arrests "if the marijuana supplies
shrink further."
He claims that this shows a
positive relationship between the
use of marijuana and a natural
progression to harder drugs. His
statistics indicate, however, that if
marijuana is brought back into
general circulation the use of
harder drugs is decreased
measurably.
Prices Slay Down
The crackdown has almost
gone unnoticed. A check with a
number of local dealers revealed
that locally prices are slightly
higher than normal, and the
quality isn't the best, but grass
can still be had. The harder drugs
are more available than ever.
But it is possible that the price
of marijuana and other drugs will
be raised. Most officials agree
though that the slight rise in
marijuana prices could be
attributed to the steady rise in he
cost of living that even the
squarest housewife feels when she
shops at a local supermarket.
If Intercept has received
endorsement from the Nixon
Administration, it has received
widespread criticism elsewhere.
Legislators assailed the
"offensive inspections" that have
held up border traffic, and
commercial interests announced
the start of "Operation Dignity"
to discourage Mexicans from
purchasing U.S. products.

Newspaper editorials
denounced the "insulting
harassment" of a Mexican
consulate official in El Paso, who
allegedly was pulled out of his car
and manhandled by policemen
and a customs inspector.
Under instruction from
President Gustov Diaz Ordaz,
Foreign Minister Antonio Carrillo
Flores is discussing the situation
with Secretary of State William P.
Rogers in Washington.
The President of the Mexican
Confederation of Chambers of
Commerce, Francisco Cano
Escalente, said Operation Dignity
has already gone into effect in
border cities from Tijuana to
Matomoros on the Gulf of
Mexico.
Bridge Roadblock
From Ciudad Uarez across the
border from El Paso, came word
that citizens are considering the
formation of a human roadblock
across the international bridge to
halt traffic between the two cities
until Operation Intercept is called
off.
Cano Escalante said the
Mexican campaign will cause
considerable suffering among
businessmen in the U.S. but will
benefit Mexican shopkeepers.
Mexican border residents
normally spend about $400,000 a
year in American stores, he said.
As Mexican businessmen from
one end of the border to the other
reported losses ranging from 40 to
90 per cent in receipts, the
president of the American
Chamber of Commerce here called
for U.S. authorities to ease up on
the exhaustive border inspection.
Salvadore P. Lio said the
present harassment must be
stopped to avoid further
economic losses and the
humiliation of innocent travelers.
Border Ghost Town
Thousands of workers who
normally cross the Mexican
border each day have been forced
to get up hours in advance or to
forget work altogether. It is
reported that many of the towns
along the border are rapidly
becoming ghost towns as fewer
tourists arrive.
At a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week Dr. Joel Fort, a
University of California at
Berkeley professor of social
welfare, told the session that
"Operation Intercept is the latest
in a series of carefully designed

smokescreens to make the public
believe that something effective
and important is being done about
the drug problem."
More Serious Problems
He said it has obscured the "far
more serious problems our society
faces about which little is being
done, including violence, racism,
poverty, disease, war and
alienation."
"It (Intercept) is the modern
equivalent of Roman bread and
circuses, and as long as we
continue to ignore the roots or
basic causes of drug use and
abuses we will perpetuate human
misery, not solve problems," he
added.
Amidst all of this criticism
Operation Intercept goes on.
Secretary of the Treasury David
M. Kennedy and Attorney
General Mitchell said that
Intercept will continue
"indefinitely.
If it is to end, it will probably
be phased out gradually."
But as one critic said of the
attempt to stop the entrance of
grass into the United States along
a 2,000 mile border, "It's like
trying to cure cancer with an
aspirin."
Its the most expensive grass
killer ever invented.

Drug Price Increase
California Attorney General
Thomas Lynch thinks that a
successful crackdown on
marijuana will drive its price up
and lead to increased use of other
drugs.
Lynch said recently that charts
of the number of arrests for
marijuana and dangerous drug
offenses in the past ten years
revealed that any change in one
group was accompanied by "an
offsetting reaction" in the other.
The attorney general said 1969
would be a ''dramatic
e x ample "—with arrests for
dangerous drugs catching up and

possibly exceeding marijuana
arrests "if the marijuana supplies
shrink further."
He claims that this shows a
positive relationship between the
use of marijuana and a natural
progression to harder drugs. His
statistics indicate, however, that if
marijuana is brought back into
general circulation the use of
harder drugs is decreased
measurably.
Prices Slay Down
The crackdown has almost
gone unnoticed. A check with a
number of local dealers revealed
that locally prices are slightly
higher than normal, and the
quality isn't the best, but grass
can still be had. The harder drugs
are more available than ever.
But it is possible that the price
of marijuana and other drugs will
be raised. Most officials agree
though that the slight rise in
marijuana prices could be
attributed to the steady rise in he
cost of living that even the
squarest housewife feels when she
shops at a local supermarket.
If Intercept has received
endorsement from the Nixon
Administration, it has received
widespread criticism elsewhere.
Legislators assailed the
"offensive inspections" that have
held up border traffic, and
commercial interests announced
the start of "Operation Dignity"
to discourage Mexicans from
purchasing U.S. products.

Newspaper editorials
denounced the "insulting
harassment" of a Mexican
consulate official in El Paso, who
allegedly was pulled out of his car
and manhandled by policemen
and a customs inspector.
Under instruction from
President Gustov Diaz Ordaz,
Foreign Minister Antonio Carrillo
Flores is discussing the situation
with Secretary of State William P.
Rogers in Washington.
The President of the Mexican
Confederation of Chambers of
Commerce, Francisco Cano
Escalente, said Operation Dignity
has already gone into effect in
border cities from Tijuana to
Matomoros on the Gulf of
Mexico.
Bridge Roadblock
From Ciudad Uarez across the
border from El Paso, came word
that citizens are considering the
formation of a human roadblock
across the international bridge to
halt traffic between the two cities
until Operation Intercept is called
off.
Cano Escalante said the
Mexican campaign will cause
considerable suffering among
businessmen in the U.S. but will
benefit Mexican shopkeepers.
Mexican border residents
normally spend about $400,000 a
year in American stores, he said.
As Mexican businessmen from
one end of the border to the other
reported losses ranging from 40 to
90 per cent in receipts, the
president of the American
Chamber of Commerce here called
for U.S. authorities to ease up on
the exhaustive border inspection.
Salvadore P. Lio said the
present harassment must be
stopped to avoid further
economic losses and the
humiliation of innocent travelers.
Border Ghost Town
Thousands of workers who
normally cross the Mexican
border each day have been forced
to get up hours in advance or to
forget work altogether. It is
reported that many of the towns
along the border are rapidly
becoming ghost towns as fewer
tourists arrive.
At a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week Dr. Joel Fort, a
University of California at
Berkeley professor of social
welfare, told the session that
"Operation Intercept is the latest
in a series of carefully designed

smokescreens to make the public
believe that something effective
and important is being done about
the drug problem."
More Serious Problems
He said it has obscured the "far
more serious problems our society
faces about which little is being
done, including violence, racism,
poverty, disease, war and
alienation."
"It (Intercept) is the modern
equivalent of Roman bread and
circuses, and as long as we
continue to ignore the roots or
basic causes of drug use and
abuses we will perpetuate human
misery, not solve problems," he
added.
Amidst all of this criticism
Operation Intercept goes on.
Secretary of the Treasury David
M. Kennedy and Attorney
General Mitchell said that
Intercept will continue
"indefinitely.
If it is to end, it will probably
be phased out gradually."
But as one critic said of the
attempt to stop the entrance of
grass into the United States along
a 2,000 mile border, "It's like
trying to cure cancer with an
aspirin."
Its the most expensive grass
killer ever invented.
Undertaken nearly three weeks
ago, Operation Intercept becomes
a gathering place for customs
agents and traffic jams at the
border separating the United
States from Mexico.
The tactic is aimed at cutting
off the supply of marijuana and
other drugs from Mexico. In
recent days border officials have
gone so far as to strip those
making the crossing. Thousands of
travelers are forced to wait in lines
up to six hours long until customs
officials can check them.
The "grass curtain," as it is
being called, began Sept. 22 as the
most intensive such operation in
U.S. peacetime history.
According to officials in
Washington,"the objective of the
program is to reduce the volume
of narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs which are
smuggled into the United States
from Mexico, thus cutting down
the supply available to addicts and
users in this country."
Mitchell and Marijuana
Attorney General John
Mitchell claims that 80 per cent of
the marijuana smoked in the
United States, about 20 per cent
of the heroin used, and an
undetermined volume of illegal
amphetamines enter the country
from Mexico.
Intercept is expected to
continue to an indefinite period
and involves the law enforcement
forces of several branches of the
federal government.
In the meantime hordes of
people will have to wait at the
border until inspectors can search
their bodies and belongings.
Traffic the first day was
backed up for several miles as the
bullfights ended in Tijuana.
Northbound traffic sprawled
across all four lanes of the
highway waiting to fan out into
the 16 inspection lanes.
Inspectors who are specially
trained for the work, went
through cars from hood to trunk,
paying particular attention to
luggage and makeshift parcels and
containers such as cardboard
boxes.
Tequila and Horns
Frustrated motorists have
reacted by blaring their horns for
hours on end while others sit
patiently sipping tequila. There

have been no reports of drunk
driving in the jam.
There have been many
incidents of motorists turning
back or sacks of items being
hurled from cars as they near the
border check.
On the border itself there have
been relatively few people
arrested on smuggling charges and
only a small quantity of drugs
recovered. Only 33 persons have
been arrested out of a total of
nearly two million people
inspected.
But the rationale for the
border check is to prevent
marijuana and drugs from coming
into the United States, not to
make mass arrests, said one
official.
Other officials say they hope
to raise the price of the weed so
high that few can afford it.

benefit Mexican shopkeepers.
Mexican border residents
normally spend about $400,000 a
year in American stores, he said.
As Mexican businessmen from
one end of the border to the other
reported losses ranging from 40 to
90 per cent in receipts, the
president of the American
Chamber of Commerce here called
for U.S. authorities to ease up on
the exhaustive border inspection.
Salvadore P. Lio said the
present harassment must be
stopped to avoid further
economic losses and the
humiliation of innocent travelers.
Border Ghost Town
Thousands of workers who
normally cross the Mexican
border each day have been forced
to get up hours in advance or to
forget work altogether. It is
reported that many of the towns
along the border are rapidly
becoming ghost towns as fewer
tourists arrive.
At a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week Dr. Joel Fort, a
University of California at
Berkeley professor of social
welfare, told the session that
"Operation Intercept is the latest
in a series of carefully designed

smokescreens to make the public
believe that something effective
and important is being done about
the drug problem."
More Serious Problems
He said it has obscured the "far
more serious problems our society
faces about which little is being
done, including violence, racism,
poverty, disease, war and
alienation."
"It (Intercept) is the modern
equivalent of Roman bread and
circuses, and as long as we
continue to ignore the roots or
basic causes of drug use and
abuses we will perpetuate human
misery, not solve problems," he
added.
Amidst all of this criticism
Operation Intercept goes on.
Secretary of the Treasury David
M. Kennedy and Attorney
General Mitchell said that
Intercept will continue
"indefinitely.
If it is to end, it will probably
be phased out gradually."
But as one critic said of the
attempt to stop the entrance of
grass into the United States along
a 2,000 mile border, "It's like
trying to cure cancer with an
aspirin."
Its the most expensive grass
killer ever invented.
Undertaken nearly three weeks
ago, Operation Intercept becomes
a gathering place for customs
agents and traffic jams at the
border separating the United
States from Mexico.
The tactic is aimed at cutting
off the supply of marijuana and
other drugs from Mexico. In
recent days border officials have
gone so far as to strip those
making the crossing. Thousands of
travelers are forced to wait in lines
up to six hours long until customs
officials can check them.
The "grass curtain," as it is
being called, began Sept. 22 as the
most intensive such operation in
U.S. peacetime history.
According to officials in
Washington,"the objective of the
program is to reduce the volume
of narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs which are
smuggled into the United States
from Mexico, thus cutting down
the supply available to addicts and
users in this country."
Mitchell and Marijuana
Attorney General John
Mitchell claims that 80 per cent of
the marijuana smoked in the
United States, about 20 per cent
of the heroin used, and an
undetermined volume of illegal
amphetamines enter the country
from Mexico.
Intercept is expected to
continue to an indefinite period
and involves the law enforcement
forces of several branches of the
federal government.
In the meantime hordes of
people will have to wait at the
border until inspectors can search
their bodies and belongings.
Traffic the first day was
backed up for several miles as the
bullfights ended in Tijuana.
Northbound traffic sprawled
across all four lanes of the
highway waiting to fan out into
the 16 inspection lanes.
Inspectors who are specially
trained for the work, went
through cars from hood to trunk,
paying particular attention to
luggage and makeshift parcels and
containers such as cardboard
boxes.
Tequila and Horns
Frustrated motorists have
reacted by blaring their horns for
hours on end while others sit
patiently sipping tequila. There

have been no reports of drunk
driving in the jam.
There have been many
incidents of motorists turning
back or sacks of items being
hurled from cars as they near the
border check.
On the border itself there have
been relatively few people
arrested on smuggling charges and
only a small quantity of drugs
recovered. Only 33 persons have
been arrested out of a total of
nearly two million people
inspected.
But the rationale for the
border check is to prevent
marijuana and drugs from coming
into the United States, not to
make mass arrests, said one
official.
Other officials say they hope
to raise the price of the weed so
high that few can afford it.
Drug Price Increase
California Attorney General
Thomas Lynch thinks that a
successful crackdown on
marijuana will drive its price up
and lead to increased use of other
drugs.
Lynch said recently that charts
of the number of arrests for
marijuana and dangerous drug
offenses in the past ten years
revealed that any change in one
group was accompanied by "an
offsetting reaction" in the other.
The attorney general said 1969
would be a ''dramatic
e x ample "—with arrests for
dangerous drugs catching up and

possibly exceeding marijuana
arrests "if the marijuana supplies
shrink further."
He claims that this shows a
positive relationship between the
use of marijuana and a natural
progression to harder drugs. His
statistics indicate, however, that if
marijuana is brought back into
general circulation the use of
harder drugs is decreased
measurably.
Prices Slay Down
The crackdown has almost
gone unnoticed. A check with a
number of local dealers revealed
that locally prices are slightly
higher than normal, and the
quality isn't the best, but grass
can still be had. The harder drugs
are more available than ever.
But it is possible that the price
of marijuana and other drugs will
be raised. Most officials agree
though that the slight rise in
marijuana prices could be
attributed to the steady rise in he
cost of living that even the
squarest housewife feels when she
shops at a local supermarket.
If Intercept has received
endorsement from the Nixon
Administration, it has received
widespread criticism elsewhere.
Legislators assailed the
"offensive inspections" that have
held up border traffic, and
commercial interests announced
the start of "Operation Dignity"
to discourage Mexicans from
purchasing U.S. products.

Newspaper editorials
denounced the "insulting
harassment" of a Mexican
consulate official in El Paso, who
allegedly was pulled out of his car
and manhandled by policemen
and a customs inspector.
Under instruction from
President Gustov Diaz Ordaz,
Foreign Minister Antonio Carrillo
Flores is discussing the situation
with Secretary of State William P.
Rogers in Washington.
The President of the Mexican
Confederation of Chambers of
Commerce, Francisco Cano
Escalente, said Operation Dignity
has already gone into effect in
border cities from Tijuana to
Matomoros on the Gulf of
Mexico.
Bridge Roadblock
From Ciudad Uarez across the
border from El Paso, came word
that citizens are considering the
formation of a human roadblock
across the international bridge to
halt traffic between the two cities
until Operation Intercept is called
off.
Cano Escalante said the
Mexican campaign will cause
considerable suffering among
businessmen in the U.S. but will
benefit Mexican shopkeepers.

U.S. peacetime history.
According to officials in
Washington,"the objective of the
program is to reduce the volume
of narcotics, marijuana and
dangerous drugs which are
smuggled into the United States
from Mexico, thus cutting down
the supply available to addicts and
users in this country."
Mitchell and Marijuana
Attorney General John
Mitchell claims that 80 per cent of
the marijuana smoked in the
United States, about 20 per cent
of the heroin used, and an
undetermined volume of illegal
amphetamines enter the country
from Mexico.
Intercept is expected to
continue to an indefinite period
and involves the law enforcement
forces of several branches of the
federal government.
In the meantime hordes of
people will have to wait at the
border until inspectors can search
their bodies and belongings.
Traffic the first day was
backed up for several miles as the
bullfights ended in Tijuana.
Northbound traffic sprawled
across all four lanes of the
highway waiting to fan out into
the 16 inspection lanes.
Inspectors who are specially
trained for the work, went
through cars from hood to trunk,
paying particular attention to
luggage and makeshift parcels and
containers such as cardboard
boxes.
Tequila and Horns
Frustrated motorists have
reacted by blaring their horns for
hours on end while others sit
patiently sipping tequila. There

have been no reports of drunk
driving in the jam.
There have been many
incidents of motorists turning
back or sacks of items being
hurled from cars as they near the
border check.
On the border itself there have
been relatively few people
arrested on smuggling charges and
only a small quantity of drugs
recovered. Only 33 persons have
been arrested out of a total of
nearly two million people
inspected.
But the rationale for the
border check is to prevent
marijuana and drugs from coming
into the United States, not to
make mass arrests, said one
official.
Other officials say they hope
to raise the price of the weed so
high that few can afford it.
Drug Price Increase
California Attorney General
Thomas Lynch thinks that a
successful crackdown on
marijuana will drive its price up
and lead to increased use of other
drugs.
Lynch said recently that charts
of the number of arrests for
marijuana and dangerous drug
offenses in the past ten years
revealed that any change in one
group was accompanied by "an
offsetting reaction" in the other.
The attorney general said 1969
would be a ''dramatic
e x ample "—with arrests for
dangerous drugs catching up and

possibly exceeding marijuana
arrests "if the marijuana supplies
shrink further."
He claims that this shows a
positive relationship between the
use of marijuana and a natural
progression to harder drugs. His
statistics indicate, however, that if
marijuana is brought back into
general circulation the use of
harder drugs is decreased
measurably.
Prices Slay Down
The crackdown has almost
gone unnoticed. A check with a
number of local dealers revealed
that locally prices are slightly
higher than normal, and the
quality isn't the best, but grass
can still be had. The harder drugs
are more available than ever.
But it is possible that the price
of marijuana and other drugs will
be raised. Most officials agree
though that the slight rise in
marijuana prices could be
attributed to the steady rise in he
cost of living that even the
squarest housewife feels when she
shops at a local supermarket.
If Intercept has received
endorsement from the Nixon
Administration, it has received
widespread criticism elsewhere.
Legislators assailed the
"offensive inspections" that have
held up border traffic, and
commercial interests announced
the start of "Operation Dignity"
to discourage Mexicans from
purchasing U.S. products.

Newspaper editorials
denounced the "insulting
harassment" of a Mexican
consulate official in El Paso, who
allegedly was pulled out of his car
and manhandled by policemen
and a customs inspector.
Under instruction from
President Gustov Diaz Ordaz,
Foreign Minister Antonio Carrillo
Flores is discussing the situation
with Secretary of State William P.
Rogers in Washington.
The President of the Mexican
Confederation of Chambers of
Commerce, Francisco Cano
Escalente, said Operation Dignity
has already gone into effect in
border cities from Tijuana to
Matomoros on the Gulf of
Mexico.
Bridge Roadblock
From Ciudad Uarez across the
border from El Paso, came word
that citizens are considering the
formation of a human roadblock
across the international bridge to
halt traffic between the two cities
until Operation Intercept is called
off.
Cano Escalante said the
Mexican campaign will cause
considerable suffering among
businessmen in the U.S. but will
benefit Mexican shopkeepers.
Mexican border residents
normally spend about $400,000 a
year in American stores, he said.
As Mexican businessmen from
one end of the border to the other
reported losses ranging from 40 to
90 per cent in receipts, the
president of the American
Chamber of Commerce here called
for U.S. authorities to ease up on
the exhaustive border inspection.
Salvadore P. Lio said the
present harassment must be
stopped to avoid further
economic losses and the
humiliation of innocent travelers.
Border Ghost Town
Thousands of workers who
normally cross the Mexican
border each day have been forced
to get up hours in advance or to
forget work altogether. It is
reported that many of the towns
along the border are rapidly
becoming ghost towns as fewer
tourists arrive.
At a Senate subcommittee
hearing last week Dr. Joel Fort, a
University of California at
Berkeley professor of social
welfare, told the session that
"Operation Intercept is the latest
in a series of carefully designed

smokescreens to make the public
believe that something effective
and important is being done about
the drug problem."
More Serious Problems
He said it has obscured the "far
more serious problems our society
faces about which little is being
done, including violence, racism,
poverty, disease, war and
alienation."
"It (Intercept) is the modern
equivalent of Roman bread and
circuses, and as long as we
continue to ignore the roots or
basic causes of drug use and
abuses we will perpetuate human
misery, not solve problems," he
added.
Amidst all of this criticism
Operation Intercept goes on.
Secretary of the Treasury David
M. Kennedy and Attorney
General Mitchell said that
Intercept will continue
"indefinitely.
If it is to end, it will probably
be phased out gradually."
But as one critic said of the
attempt to stop the entrance of
grass into the United States along
a 2,000 mile border, "It's like
trying to cure cancer with an
aspirin."
