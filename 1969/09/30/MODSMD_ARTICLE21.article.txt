Alan S. Maremont of San
Francisco, an independent
consultant specializing in low and
moderate income housing, has
been retained by the University to
advise on the feasibility of rental
housing on Stanford lands.
The Board of Trustees, at its
June meeting, authorized "urgent
exploration" of a possible site

for low and moderate rental
housing at the southeast corner of
the Page Mill-Foothill intersection
and the exploration of other
alternatives.
The low-rent housing proposal
was included in a faculty-staff
-student committee report in May.
An interim committee met during
the summer pending the
appointment of an ad hoc
committee this fall. President
Kenneth S. Pitzer is expected to
appoint the faculty-staff-student
committee soon.
The committee, which is
expected to reflect a broad
representation of the campus
community, will make
recommendations about whom
the proposed project would serve,
the racial balance, the number of
units, costs, and other such
pertinent information.
Maremont will advise and assist
the committee in its studies and
deliberations.
The function and responsibility
of the Ad Hoc Housing Advisory
Committee will be to review
alternatives and to make
recommendations on major policy
questions.
Edward A. Scoles, assistant
business manager for University
Housing, will serve as the
committee's secretary.
Maremont, who also is an
attorney, has been working
primarily for the past four years
as the coordinator of the Kate
Maremont Foundation, nonprofit
sponsor of the development of the
two large moderate-income rental
housing developments, Crescent
Park in Richmond and Glenridge
in San Francisco. Both now are
completed and fully occupied on
a racially balanced basis.
