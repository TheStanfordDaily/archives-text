# National Split
## Local YAF More Liberal 
### BILL EVERS 
This summer the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF) as
well as SDS were beset with
factional in-fighting and internal
ideological differences. Though
the expulsion of the Profressive
Labor Party from SDS grabbed
headlines, less publicized events at
the national convention of YAF
in St. Louis showed that young
right-wingers too are increasingly
polarized.
In YAP" there are two
philosophical positions: that of
the traditionalist conservatives
and that of the libertarians. The
traditionalists support laws which
enforce the moral beliefs of the
majority of the body politic, an
aggressive anti-communist foreign
policy ("why not victory?"), and
a crackdown on rebellion by
students and blacks ("law and
order").
The libertarians want a
non-interventionist foreign policy
for the United States, free trade,
personal freedom ("do your own
thing"), and abolition of the
draft.

The nature of iht* split in YAF
was best illustrated at the
convention by the fury of the
traditionalist delegates when an
anarchist among the libertarians
burned his draft card. But all
during the convention there were
major differences on such matters
as the war in Viet-Nam and laws
which ban drugs. Some
libertarians got a resolution onto
the floor which called for draft
resistance by YAF'ers, but it was
defeated.
The traditionalist "national
slate" put together by those who
control YAF's national office won
all the open positions on the
board of directors and had its way
on every resolution, because of
superior delegate strength. But it
was evident that the libertarians
gained adherents just in the course
of the convention and that
libertarian strength in YAF has
increased markedly in recent
years.
As a result of the
traditionalists' victory at the
convention, the national YAF
organization retains its
anti-communist and anti-student
radical focus. Many libertarians
though are seceding from the
organization.
Calilornians Pulling Out
Libertarian chapters of YAF in
Pennsylvania have broken off to
form a new organization.
California chapters are already
pulling out and more may leave if
the YAF national office is
unsuccessful in patching up
differences in the strife-torn
California YAF organization.
Stanford YAF is among those
considering withdrawing.
One week before the Labor
Day weekend national
convention, the entire state-level
organization in California was
dissolved by the national office
after the predominantly-libertar
ian state leadership fired an
important traditionalist California
YAF officer for misuse of funds.
In the ensuing controversy,
Stanford YAF chairman, Harvey
Hukari, whose philosophy is a
mixture of libertarianism and
traditionalism, resigned from the
slate sponsored by the national
office and decided to run as an
independent.
Hukari said at the time, "I feel
that my continued presence on
the 'YAF team' would imply that
I somehow endorse the hypocrisy
and manipulation of the national
leadership in both its handling of
the election of members to the
National Board and in its
dismemberment of the state
organization of California YAF."

Hukari, who is nationally
renowned in YAF because of his
opposition to Stanford radicals,
was narrowly defeated in the
election of new national board
members. Prior to the vote,
supporters of the national office's
slate spread the rumor that he
worked in collaboration with SDS
and charged that Hukari wanted
to abolish YAF's national
advisory board which includes
congressmen and prominent
proponents of conservatism.
At the convention Stanford
YAF received the Outstanding
Chapter Award and The Arena
was named the outstanding
conservative college newspaper.

office and decided to run as an
independent.
Hukari said at the time, "I feel
that my continued presence on
the 'YAF team' would imply that
I somehow endorse the hypocrisy
and manipulation of the national
leadership in both its handling of
the election of members to the
National Board and in its
dismemberment of the state
organization of California YAF."

Hukari, who is nationally
renowned in YAF because of his
opposition to Stanford radicals,
was narrowly defeated in the
election of new national board
members. Prior to the vote,
supporters of the national office's
slate spread the rumor that he
worked in collaboration with SDS
and charged that Hukari wanted
to abolish YAF's national
advisory board which includes
congressmen and prominent
proponents of conservatism.
At the convention Stanford
YAF received the Outstanding
Chapter Award and The Arena
was named the outstanding
conservative college newspaper.
This summer the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF) as
well as SDS were beset with
factional in-fighting and internal
ideological differences. Though
the expulsion of the Profressive
Labor Party from SDS grabbed
headlines, less publicized events at
the national convention of YAF
in St. Louis showed that young
right-wingers too are increasingly
polarized.
In YAP" there are two
philosophical positions: that of
the traditionalist conservatives
and that of the libertarians. The
traditionalists support laws which
enforce the moral beliefs of the
majority of the body politic, an
aggressive anti-communist foreign
policy ("why not victory?"), and
a crackdown on rebellion by
students and blacks ("law and
order").
The libertarians want a
non-interventionist foreign policy
for the United States, free trade,
personal freedom ("do your own
thing"), and abolition of the
draft.

The nature of iht* split in YAF
was best illustrated at the
convention by the fury of the
traditionalist delegates when an
anarchist among the libertarians
burned his draft card. But all
during the convention there were
major differences on such matters
as the war in Viet-Nam and laws
which ban drugs. Some
libertarians got a resolution onto
the floor which called for draft
resistance by YAF'ers, but it was
defeated.
The traditionalist "national
slate" put together by those who
control YAF's national office won
all the open positions on the
board of directors and had its way
on every resolution, because of
superior delegate strength. But it
was evident that the libertarians
gained adherents just in the course
of the convention and that
libertarian strength in YAF has
increased markedly in recent
years.
As a result of the
traditionalists' victory at the
convention, the national YAF
organization retains its
anti-communist and anti-student
radical focus. Many libertarians
though are seceding from the
organization.
Calilornians Pulling Out
Libertarian chapters of YAF in
Pennsylvania have broken off to
form a new organization.
California chapters are already
pulling out and more may leave if
the YAF national office is
unsuccessful in patching up
differences in the strife-torn
California YAF organization.
Stanford YAF is among those
considering withdrawing.
One week before the Labor
Day weekend national
convention, the entire state-level
organization in California was
dissolved by the national office
after the predominantly-libertar
ian state leadership fired an
important traditionalist California
YAF officer for misuse of funds.
In the ensuing controversy,
Stanford YAF chairman, Harvey
Hukari, whose philosophy is a
mixture of libertarianism and
traditionalism, resigned from the
slate sponsored by the national
office and decided to run as an
