Graduate housing, a graduate
student center, and graduate
participation in the October 15
Vietnam moratorium will be some
of the major issues that the
Graduate Student Association will
confront this quarter.
Tonight there will be an
organizational meeting at 8:00 in
the Tresidder small lounge for
anyone interested in the GSA.
Currently the GSA is planning
a conference on "Technology and
the Third World" featuring John
Kenneth Galbraith on the 17 and
18 of October. They are also
planning a graduate student center
just off campus.
This would be an eating facility,

and coffee house combination
which will be used for social
activities and entertainment as
well. People are needed to help
with these activities and also to
plan social events and edit a
newsletter.
The Association's proposed
budget is about $5,000 for the
year, which will be used for
projects or events generally of
interest to graduate students.
They would like someone from
each department and each
graduate organization on the
administrative board. From this
group they will select a steering
committee which will report back
to the board at monthly meetings.
