The Ford Foundation has
granted $135,866 to Stanford
University to help support its
undergraduate program in African
and Afro-American studies,
Stanford President Kenneth S.
Pitzer announced last August.
Stanford was the first major
university to establish an
interdepartmental major in the
field, and last spring 13
sophomores and juniors began
their degree work in the new
program.
The chairman of the
Committee on Afro and
Afro-American Studies is St. Clair
Drake, one of the nation's
foremost black scholars in
sociology and anthropology, who
joins the faculty this fall.
The Ford grant will support
development of the core courses
in the program, a new one called
African Civilizations, and one
presented for the first time last
year, Racism and Prejudice.
