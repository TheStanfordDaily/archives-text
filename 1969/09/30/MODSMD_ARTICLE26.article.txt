The Law School Admission
Test, required of candidates for
admission to most American Law
Schools, will be given at more
than 250 centers throughout the
nation on November 8, 1969,
February 14, 1970, April 11,
1970, and July 25, 1970.
The test, which is administered
by Educational Testing Service,
was taken last year by over
58,000 candidates whose scores
were sent to over 165 law schools.
ETS advises candidates to make
separate application to each law
school of their choice, and to
ascertain from each whether it
requires the Law School Ad
mission Test. Since many law
schools select their freshmen
classes in the spring preceding

entrance, candidates for admission
to next year's classes are advised
to take either the November or
the February test.
The morning session of the Law
School Admission Test measures
the ability to use language and to
think logically. The afternoon
session includes measures of
writing ability and general back
ground.
Registration forms may be
obtained at the Law School
Admissions Office.
