# Usher Tickets Now
## 
### 
For the price of one hour's
work, students this year will be
able to see theater, symphony,
and opera performances at San
Francisco theaters.
Students may sign up for
ushering passes for such shows as
"Hair," "Jacques Brel is Alive and
Well and Living in Paris," "You're
a 3ood Man, Charlie Brown," and
opera and symphony concerts at
the San Francisco Opera House.
Sign-ups will be conducted each
week at the Box Office at
Tresidder Union, beginning at 10
a.m. on Tuesday for performances
the following week-end. Passes
will be issued on a first-come
first-served basis. Student body
cards must be presented to receive
passes.
Early Arrival
As an usher, a student must
arrive at the theater one hour to
one-and-a-half hours before the
performance begins. Before the
show starts he may be asked to
help prepare programs for distri
bution, then to show patrons to
their seats.
After the performance begins
and late-comers have been shown
to their seats, ushers may usually
take available seats, following the
directions of the head usher.
Quota Sel
This ushering service is available
at a number of schools in the Bay
Area. Like the others, Stanford
will be given a quota of passes
each week. In beginning the

program, Stanford will receive a
limited number of passesâ€”all for
week-end performances. If stu
dent demand is greater than this,
Stanford's quota may be increased
to meet the demand.
Students who sign up for passes
then fail to appear at the theater
at the designated time will not be
issued other passes in the future.
Further information on usher
ing is available at the Tresidder
Union Box Office.
