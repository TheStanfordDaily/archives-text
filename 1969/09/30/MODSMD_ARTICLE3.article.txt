# Border Tourist Trade Hit
## 
### 
LOS ANGELES (AP)-U.S.
officials confirmed Monday what
irate Mexican businessmen have
known for a week: The flow of
U.S. tourists across the border has
been cut in half or more by
controversial Operation Intercept.
But Mexican outrage will not
affect the U.S. clampdown on
narcotics smuggling and the
intensive border checks that have
delayed motorists for hours, U.S.
officials said.
Seizures over the weekend
were reported as follows: 70
pounds of hashish valued at
$1,000 per pound; 20 ounces of
pure heroin worth $14,160 on the
illicit market, and 440 pounds of
mariii ana valued at $13,200.
Of the effect on tourism, a
spokesman for the operation said

flatly, "Too bad. Frankly, I don't
care about the Mexican reaction;
the purpose is to cut down the
narcotics traffic and it's doing it."
During 24 hours last Sunday,
the official said, a total of
293,7 90 persons crossed into
Mexico at stations along the
2,500-mile border.
A week before, as Operation
Intercept began, customs
inspectors counted 418,561
persons crossing the border from
2:30 p.m.—the hour the program
started—to midnight. Many more
had crossed the first 141/2 hours of
the day.
A week later, wary of the
previous Sunday's traffic snarls,
motorists avoided Mexico. Traffic
was far lighter.
