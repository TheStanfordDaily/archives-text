## Protesters Seize Wisconsin Capitol 
### 
MADISON, Wis. (AP)-Some
2,000 welfare demonstrators
controlled Wisconsin's Capitol last
night, while more than 100 police
officers and sheriff's deputies
gathered in an isolated part of the
building.
It was learned that Gov.
Warren P. Knowles had alerted
units of the National Guard. A
spokesman said the guardsmen,
who were to arrive later in the
night, would cordon off the
building, preventing anyone from
entering, while police cleared the
structure.
The singing, chanting
protestors burst into the
Assembly chambers in the
afternoon, forcing cancellation of
a speech by Knowles and
adjournment until Tuesday of the
special legislative session, called to
consider urban and welfare aids.
Demonstrators were ordered
to clear the building by 6 p.m.
Welfare mothers and their tired
children left, but about 800
persons, many of then University
of Wisconsin students, remained
in the littered chambers.
Leaders urged demonstrators
to "go limp" and avoid violence if
police moved in.
