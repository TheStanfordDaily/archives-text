# Berets Freed

WASHINGTON (AP)-The
Army abruptly dropped its entire
case yesterday against the Green
Berets accused of drugging and
killing a South Vietnamese civilian
who was an alleged double agent.
Secretary of the Army Stanley
11. Resor said the Central
Intelligence Agency has refused to
provide any witnesses for
scheduled October court-martials,
making it impossible for the men
to be tried fairly.
Resor, in a four-paragraph
statement issued by the Pentagon
without elaboration, said he was
informed the CIA refusal was
made "in the interest of national
security."
For his part, Resor went on
record as disapproving of the kind
of act the eight Green Berets,
including the former Vietnam
commander Col. Robert B.
Rheault, were originally accused
of carrying out.
Lham Kim Lien, insisted her
husband, Thai Khac Chuyen, was
never a double agent and had
worked faithfully for the
Americans.

''The Americans are
cruel—they say they are the
leaders of the free world—but
they don't believe in freedom or
democracy or justice at all," she
said.
