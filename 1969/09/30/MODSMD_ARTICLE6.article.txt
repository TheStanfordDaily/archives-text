SAN FRANCISCO (AP)-The
University of California Academic
Council reversed yesterday its
20-year-old approval of a ban
against hiring Communist
professors.
The group, which acts as an
executive committee for faculty
members on all nine UC
campuses, declared Communist
party members should be allowed
to teach.
The action came in a resolution
criticizing the recent dismissal of
Angele Davis, who says she is a
Communist, from the UCLA
faculty.
The Council urged the
state-wide Academic Senate "to
take all steps necessary to
formalize" the new position "and
notify the UC regents."

meeting at San Francisco

of faculties on all campuses.
The action reversed the faculty
leadership's policy adopted after
university regents voted twice, in
1948 and 1949, to ban hiring of
Communist party members.
