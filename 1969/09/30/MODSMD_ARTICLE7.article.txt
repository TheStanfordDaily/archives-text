WASHINGTON (AP)--Senate
Republican leaders appealed
yesterday for a 60-day
moratorium on criticism of
President Nixon's Vietnam policy.
They said Nixon needs time
and "a common front'"" in the
effort to negotiate a peace
settlement.
But the prospect signaled by
congressional critics of current
policy is for escalating pressure,
not a letup, in demands for
American withdrawal. And
outside Congress plans already are
far advanced for massive
demonstrations on and off college
campuses.
Sen. Hugh Scott of
Pennsylvania, the new minority
leader, suggested the 60 day letup,
and said it was his idea. H<> said
Nixon should get such a period to
test Communist intentions.
