# Pre-Reg Discussions Hit Political, Racial Issues
## 
### BILL FREIVOGEL MARIAN JOHNSTON 
Black Student Union (BSU)
President Leo Bazile told a group
of 300 freshmen last night, "we
have decided three things. We are
not white; we don't want to be;
and what is good for whites is
often less than bad for blacks."
Bazile's statement was made
during the freshman orientation
panel "Outside Black America."
Participating with Bazile in the
discussion was Bob Hoover, a
community leader from "Nairobi"
(East Palo Alto).
"If you will look around you,
you will see that there are not as
many here as last night," he said,
referring to Sunday night's forum,
"Revolution: Right and Left."
"That's because you whites are
not interested when blacks talk.
But as soon as we move into some
other kind of action, we are the
most beautiful people around.
Then everyone wants to sit down
and talk to us."
Again referring to the Sunday
night panel, Bazile cautioned
freshmen against using labels of
left and right as crutches.
"You're not thinking when
you do that. Blacks don't fit into
either one, left or right; because
both are white," he said.
In illustrating his contention
Bazile noted: "Look, to you,
when the 'serene Oriental'
becomes communist he has 'Gone
Crazy'. But I don't use labels."
"All I can say is that any man
who is organizing 800 million
people is not a bad motherfucker.
It sure doesn't take any brains to
realize that he's doing a better job
than Richard Nixon."
During much of his speech
Bazile stressed that the black man
was in the midst of a
psychological revolution. He said
that the role of the BSU in this
revolution is to help the black
man find identity in an institution
"made by whites for whites."
In elaborating on Bazile's
political analysis, Hoover focused
on the community problems he
faces as the principal of an
all balck private school system in
"Nairobi".
He emphasized that he was sick
of most of the white help his
community receives. "I'm sick of
being Stanford's ideal laboratory.
If whites want to help they must
work on the source of the

problem—and that is on your side
of the freeway."
Right and Left
The previous panel, held
Sunday night at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, "Revolution: Right
and Left," represented a wide
spectrum of political thought.
Speaking for the right were
Harvey Hukari, past president of
Stanford's chapter of the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
and Jim Schnieder of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC). Representing
the left were Paul Rupert of the
Palo Alto Resistance and English
Prof. Bruce Franklin.
The presentation began as
Schnieder explained the position
of the CAC in the left-right split.
CAC is a "status quo"
organization, he said. "We oppose
the tactics of revolutionaries on
the left and right."
Schnieder believes that
"nothing substantial or lasting was
accomplished by demonstrations,
only by hard work."
Rupert concentrated his
remarks on the type of education
freshmen can expect at Stanford.
Much money comes to the
university from the government
and big business for research.
"That research influences the
nature of the education you're
going to get," he said. "What you
are going to learn here will not be
critical of the United States and

will not focus your attention on
the real problems."
Liberation Movement
Hukari explained the YAF's
position as anti-communist, "but
not as an excuse for political
repression," and favoring
governmental decentralization and
free enterprise.
"Liberating minds" is YAF's
chief concern, said Hukari. YAF is
working for an end to compulsion
by any means—the draft,
censorship, or graduation
requirements. He also announced
plans for a social security card
burning later in the quarter.
Franklin came out with the
heaviest political-economic
analysis of the evening. "The
major categories in the world
today are not left and right," he
said. "The key categories are the
oppressed people of the world and
the oppressors." The United
States and Stanford are being run
by and for the benefit of the
oppressors, he believes.
"The reason there is a student
movement is that students are
rejecting the role of oppressor,"
Franklin continued. With that
realization, the only way to
achieve your own liberation is to
work for the liberation of the
oppressed."
The panel then entertained
questions from the floor, but the
questions were more derogatory
than information-seeking.

chief concern, said Hukari. YAF is
working for an end to compulsion
by any means—the draft,
censorship, or graduation
requirements. He also announced
plans for a social security card
burning later in the quarter.
Franklin came out with the
heaviest political-economic
analysis of the evening. "The
major categories in the world
today are not left and right," he
said. "The key categories are the
oppressed people of the world and
the oppressors." The United
States and Stanford are being run
by and for the benefit of the
oppressors, he believes.
"The reason there is a student
movement is that students are
rejecting the role of oppressor,"
Franklin continued. With that
realization, the only way to
achieve your own liberation is to
work for the liberation of the
oppressed."
The panel then entertained
questions from the floor, but the
questions were more derogatory
than information-seeking.
Black Student Union (BSU)
President Leo Bazile told a group
of 300 freshmen last night, "we
have decided three things. We are
not white; we don't want to be;
and what is good for whites is
often less than bad for blacks."
Bazile's statement was made
during the freshman orientation
panel "Outside Black America."
Participating with Bazile in the
discussion was Bob Hoover, a
community leader from "Nairobi"
(East Palo Alto).
"If you will look around you,
you will see that there are not as
many here as last night," he said,
referring to Sunday night's forum,
"Revolution: Right and Left."
"That's because you whites are
not interested when blacks talk.
But as soon as we move into some
other kind of action, we are the
most beautiful people around.
Then everyone wants to sit down
and talk to us."
Again referring to the Sunday
night panel, Bazile cautioned
freshmen against using labels of
left and right as crutches.
"You're not thinking when
you do that. Blacks don't fit into
either one, left or right; because
both are white," he said.
In illustrating his contention
Bazile noted: "Look, to you,
when the 'serene Oriental'
becomes communist he has 'Gone
Crazy'. But I don't use labels."
"All I can say is that any man
who is organizing 800 million
people is not a bad motherfucker.
It sure doesn't take any brains to
realize that he's doing a better job
than Richard Nixon."
During much of his speech
Bazile stressed that the black man
was in the midst of a
psychological revolution. He said
that the role of the BSU in this
revolution is to help the black
man find identity in an institution
"made by whites for whites."
In elaborating on Bazile's
political analysis, Hoover focused
on the community problems he
faces as the principal of an
all balck private school system in
"Nairobi".
He emphasized that he was sick
of most of the white help his
community receives. "I'm sick of
being Stanford's ideal laboratory.
If whites want to help they must
work on the source of the

problem—and that is on your side
of the freeway."
Right and Left
The previous panel, held
Sunday night at Dinkelspiel
Auditorium, "Revolution: Right
and Left," represented a wide
spectrum of political thought.
Speaking for the right were
Harvey Hukari, past president of
Stanford's chapter of the Young
Americans for Freedom (YAF)
and Jim Schnieder of the
Coalition for an Academic
Community (CAC). Representing
the left were Paul Rupert of the
Palo Alto Resistance and English
Prof. Bruce Franklin.
The presentation began as
Schnieder explained the position
of the CAC in the left-right split.
CAC is a "status quo"
organization, he said. "We oppose
the tactics of revolutionaries on
the left and right."
Schnieder believes that
"nothing substantial or lasting was
accomplished by demonstrations,
only by hard work."
Rupert concentrated his
remarks on the type of education
freshmen can expect at Stanford.
Much money comes to the
university from the government
and big business for research.
"That research influences the
nature of the education you're
going to get," he said. "What you
are going to learn here will not be
critical of the United States and

will not focus your attention on
the real problems."
Liberation Movement
Hukari explained the YAF's
position as anti-communist, "but
not as an excuse for political
repression," and favoring
governmental decentralization and
free enterprise.

organization, he said. "We oppose
the tactics of revolutionaries on
the left and right."
Schnieder believes that
"nothing substantial or lasting was
accomplished by demonstrations,
only by hard work."
Rupert concentrated his
remarks on the type of education
freshmen can expect at Stanford.
Much money comes to the
university from the government
and big business for research.
"That research influences the
nature of the education you're
going to get," he said. "What you
are going to learn here will not be
critical of the United States and

will not focus your attention on
the real problems."
Liberation Movement
Hukari explained the YAF's
position as anti-communist, "but
not as an excuse for political
repression," and favoring
governmental decentralization and
free enterprise.
"Liberating minds" is YAF's
chief concern, said Hukari. YAF is
working for an end to compulsion
by any means—the draft,
censorship, or graduation
requirements. He also announced
plans for a social security card
burning later in the quarter.
Franklin came out with the
heaviest political-economic
analysis of the evening. "The
major categories in the world
today are not left and right," he
said. "The key categories are the
oppressed people of the world and
the oppressors." The United
States and Stanford are being run
by and for the benefit of the
oppressors, he believes.
"The reason there is a student
movement is that students are
rejecting the role of oppressor,"
Franklin continued. With that
realization, the only way to
achieve your own liberation is to
work for the liberation of the
oppressed."
The panel then entertained
questions from the floor, but the
questions were more derogatory
than information-seeking.
