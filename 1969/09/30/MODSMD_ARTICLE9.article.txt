# Attendance At Test Low
## 
### 
Only 10% of the freshman
class took the American Council
on Education (ACE)
q u estionanires yesterday, the
first day of testing.
Counseling and Testing
Service Director John Black
attributed the poor turnout to
apathy rather than student
protest. "Mostly, thuy don't
want to fill out any more
questionnaires than they have
to," Black speculated. "The
concern over the tests mostly
gave people a justification for
their apathy."
Former graduate student
Steven Weissman, who debated
Black on the matter Sunday
night in Wilbur, was unavailable
for comment.

Yesterday's attendance
compares to a 50% turnout last
year, the first year it was made
clear that the tests were
optional.
Black expects approximately
the same percentage of
freshmen to complete the
questionnaire today, although
he indicated that most of those
taking the test did so
anonymously. "It is clear that
the follow-up aspect of the test
will be impossible."
The test, denounced by
Weissman and SDS members as
an attempt to seek out radical
students, included questions
pertaining to participation in
demonstrations and
experimentation with alcohol,
tobacco, and other drugs.
