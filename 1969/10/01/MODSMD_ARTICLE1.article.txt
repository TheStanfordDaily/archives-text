# Drama Head Alters Grades; Encounters Teacher's Protest
## 
### JENNY MATTHEWS 
A former drama instructor has
voiced strong complaints against
the attempted change of three of
his final grades by his department
chairman last spring.
The instructor, Michel
Langinieux, has charged that
Michael Barry, chairman of the
department of speech and drama,
changed three grades of F to B's
in the one-unit movement course,
Speech and Drama 265 C, without
Langinieux's knowledge or
permission. (Langinieux makes
this charge in the letters section,
p. 2 in today's Daily.)

Barry told the Daily last night
that he "accepted responsibility,
as chairman of the department,
for the action." He had stated
earlier that "since University
statutes say that no one has the
right to change the grades" given
by an instructor, "the grades were
restored" to T for all three
students.
All parties asked that the stu
dents involved remain anonymous.
Departmental Problems
The speech and drama
department has in recent times
been plagued with financial and
administrative problems. The
department was without a
chairman for nearly two years
after which Barry was named last
spring.
The orientation and staffing of
the department have been part of
the controversy. It erupted briefly
last spring when Barry, then
chairman-designate, terminated
the appointment of Paul Rebillot
as an instructor in the
department.
Barry dismissed Rebillot on the
grounds that he was a "disruptive
influence" in the department.
Shortly afterwards, Langinieux
resigned his position in the
department, due partly to this
incident.
Langinieux, who held the
position of lecturer, stated that he
discovered the alteration this
summer in the Registrar's Office
after "suspecting" that such a
change would be made.

He explained that his signed,
end-quarter report had been
altered and filed with the
Registrar with no indication that
the change of three grades had
been made.
Protested to Officials
After this discovery,
Langinieux wrote letters of
protest to various University
officials, including Associate Dean
of Humanities and Sciences,
Lawrence Ryan and President
Kenneth Pitzer.
The grades have since been
restored.
Langinieux told the Daily that
he has never discussed the issue
with Barry, however, Langinieux
received several letters of apology
from University officials.
Professor Lyle Nelson,
communications department
chairman and head of the search
committee that selected Barry,
wrote Langinieux that he was
"shocked and dismayed to learn
that an instructor's grades had
been altered by the chairman of a
department."
"Having spent most of my live
in a university environment,
Nelson continued, "I am
personally deeply committed to
the principle that individual
instructors must be the final judge
of the academic performance of
their students."
Nelson told the Daily Monday
that he was convinced the action
was an "honest error."
Another University official
suggested that the alteration of

Langinieux's grades yras probably
made out of "inexperience" and
not because of "malicious intent."
Issue Over
Barry stated yesterday, that
"All of this is over now.
Everything has been resolved
satisfactorily. The grades are
changed back. Why then is Mr.
Langinieux raising the issue
now?"
Barry further stated that at no
time has Langinieux tried to
approach him to discuss the
matter. Langinieux, on the other
hand, insisted that Barry has
"never apologized" for the
actions. At this time, Langinieux
says he has no plans for talking
over the matter with the
department chairman.
Langinieux feels that in the
drama department "certain
students obviously can get away
with whatever they want. They
know it, are helped in that
direction, and receive all the
comfort and support they need."
Langinieux stated that the
three students who received
failing grades missed more classes
that the three unexcused absences
allowed. One of the students
"missed 15" classes while the two
others missed "11 each."
"Classes did not seem
important to them any longer,"
Langinieux conjectured. "Indeed,

they got the support they
expected."
Students Unaware
One source suggested to the
Daily that Barry changed the
grades last spring because the
students involved felt the grades
were unfair and because
Langinieux was in France and
unreachable. Barry denied this.
Barry said that at the time he
was not approached by any
student regarding the grade
changes.
The Daily also learned Monday
that, at the time, the students
involved were aware neither that
they had received failing grades
nor that there had been an
attempt made to change them.
Barry has stated no reason for
the grade change. It has been
suggested, however, that Barry
was trying to be helpful to the
students and to prevent delays in
their programs.
In bringing this incident to
light, Langinieux says,"I am
simply pointing out to the
University that such a thing has
been done."
The three students receiving F's
in Langinieux's class have been
invited to repeat the course with a
different instructor. This course,
Langinieux explained, is a
requirement in the programs of
the three students.


CHANGED GRADESâ€”Three grades on one of Michel l.aniriieux's end-quarter
reports for spring quarter had been changed from F's to B's, as is evident above.
Nowhere on the report was there an indication that a change had been made by
another person. The three grades have since been changed back in the official
University records.

that the three unexcused absences
allowed. One of the students
"missed 15" classes while the two
others missed "11 each."
"Classes did not seem
important to them any longer,"
Langinieux conjectured. "Indeed,

they got the support they
expected."
Students Unaware
One source suggested to the
Daily that Barry changed the
grades last spring because the
students involved felt the grades
were unfair and because
Langinieux was in France and
unreachable. Barry denied this.
Barry said that at the time he
was not approached by any
student regarding the grade
changes.
The Daily also learned Monday
that, at the time, the students
involved were aware neither that
they had received failing grades
nor that there had been an
attempt made to change them.
Barry has stated no reason for
the grade change. It has been
suggested, however, that Barry
was trying to be helpful to the
students and to prevent delays in
their programs.
In bringing this incident to
light, Langinieux says,"I am
simply pointing out to the
University that such a thing has
been done."
The three students receiving F's
in Langinieux's class have been
invited to repeat the course with a
different instructor. This course,
Langinieux explained, is a
requirement in the programs of
the three students.


CHANGED GRADESâ€”Three grades on one of Michel l.aniriieux's end-quarter
reports for spring quarter had been changed from F's to B's, as is evident above.
Nowhere on the report was there an indication that a change had been made by
another person. The three grades have since been changed back in the official
University records.
A former drama instructor has
voiced strong complaints against
the attempted change of three of
his final grades by his department
chairman last spring.
The instructor, Michel
Langinieux, has charged that
Michael Barry, chairman of the
department of speech and drama,
changed three grades of F to B's
in the one-unit movement course,
Speech and Drama 265 C, without
Langinieux's knowledge or
permission. (Langinieux makes
this charge in the letters section,
p. 2 in today's Daily.)

Barry told the Daily last night
that he "accepted responsibility,
as chairman of the department,
for the action." He had stated
earlier that "since University
statutes say that no one has the
right to change the grades" given
by an instructor, "the grades were
restored" to T for all three
students.
All parties asked that the stu
dents involved remain anonymous.
Departmental Problems
The speech and drama
department has in recent times
been plagued with financial and
administrative problems. The
department was without a
chairman for nearly two years
after which Barry was named last
spring.
The orientation and staffing of
the department have been part of
the controversy. It erupted briefly
last spring when Barry, then
chairman-designate, terminated
the appointment of Paul Rebillot
as an instructor in the
department.
Barry dismissed Rebillot on the
grounds that he was a "disruptive
influence" in the department.
Shortly afterwards, Langinieux
resigned his position in the
department, due partly to this
incident.
Langinieux, who held the
position of lecturer, stated that he
discovered the alteration this
summer in the Registrar's Office
after "suspecting" that such a
change would be made.

He explained that his signed,
end-quarter report had been
altered and filed with the
Registrar with no indication that
the change of three grades had
been made.
Protested to Officials
After this discovery,
Langinieux wrote letters of
protest to various University
officials, including Associate Dean
of Humanities and Sciences,
Lawrence Ryan and President
Kenneth Pitzer.
The grades have since been
restored.
Langinieux told the Daily that
he has never discussed the issue
with Barry, however, Langinieux
received several letters of apology
from University officials.
Professor Lyle Nelson,
communications department
chairman and head of the search
committee that selected Barry,
wrote Langinieux that he was
"shocked and dismayed to learn
that an instructor's grades had
been altered by the chairman of a
department."
"Having spent most of my live
in a university environment,
Nelson continued, "I am
personally deeply committed to
the principle that individual
instructors must be the final judge
of the academic performance of
their students."
Nelson told the Daily Monday
that he was convinced the action
was an "honest error."
Another University official
suggested that the alteration of

Langinieux's grades yras probably
made out of "inexperience" and
not because of "malicious intent."
Issue Over
Barry stated yesterday, that
"All of this is over now.
Everything has been resolved
satisfactorily. The grades are
changed back. Why then is Mr.
Langinieux raising the issue
now?"
Barry further stated that at no
time has Langinieux tried to
approach him to discuss the
matter. Langinieux, on the other
hand, insisted that Barry has
"never apologized" for the
actions. At this time, Langinieux
says he has no plans for talking
over the matter with the
department chairman.
Langinieux feels that in the
drama department "certain
students obviously can get away
with whatever they want. They
know it, are helped in that
direction, and receive all the
comfort and support they need."
Langinieux stated that the
three students who received
failing grades missed more classes

with Barry, however, Langinieux
received several letters of apology
from University officials.
Professor Lyle Nelson,
communications department
chairman and head of the search
committee that selected Barry,
wrote Langinieux that he was
"shocked and dismayed to learn
that an instructor's grades had
been altered by the chairman of a
department."
"Having spent most of my live
in a university environment,
Nelson continued, "I am
personally deeply committed to
the principle that individual
instructors must be the final judge
of the academic performance of
their students."
Nelson told the Daily Monday
that he was convinced the action
was an "honest error."
Another University official
suggested that the alteration of

Langinieux's grades yras probably
made out of "inexperience" and
not because of "malicious intent."
Issue Over
Barry stated yesterday, that
"All of this is over now.
Everything has been resolved
satisfactorily. The grades are
changed back. Why then is Mr.
Langinieux raising the issue
now?"
Barry further stated that at no
time has Langinieux tried to
approach him to discuss the
matter. Langinieux, on the other
hand, insisted that Barry has
"never apologized" for the
actions. At this time, Langinieux
says he has no plans for talking
over the matter with the
department chairman.
Langinieux feels that in the
drama department "certain
students obviously can get away
with whatever they want. They
know it, are helped in that
direction, and receive all the
comfort and support they need."
Langinieux stated that the
three students who received
failing grades missed more classes
that the three unexcused absences
allowed. One of the students
"missed 15" classes while the two
others missed "11 each."
"Classes did not seem
important to them any longer,"
Langinieux conjectured. "Indeed,

they got the support they
expected."
Students Unaware
One source suggested to the
Daily that Barry changed the
grades last spring because the
students involved felt the grades
were unfair and because
Langinieux was in France and
unreachable. Barry denied this.
Barry said that at the time he
was not approached by any
student regarding the grade
changes.
The Daily also learned Monday
that, at the time, the students
involved were aware neither that
they had received failing grades
nor that there had been an
attempt made to change them.
Barry has stated no reason for
the grade change. It has been
suggested, however, that Barry
was trying to be helpful to the
students and to prevent delays in
their programs.
In bringing this incident to
light, Langinieux says,"I am
simply pointing out to the
University that such a thing has
been done."
The three students receiving F's
in Langinieux's class have been
invited to repeat the course with a
different instructor. This course,
Langinieux explained, is a
requirement in the programs of
the three students.


CHANGED GRADESâ€”Three grades on one of Michel l.aniriieux's end-quarter
reports for spring quarter had been changed from F's to B's, as is evident above.
Nowhere on the report was there an indication that a change had been made by
another person. The three grades have since been changed back in the official
University records.
A former drama instructor has
voiced strong complaints against
the attempted change of three of
his final grades by his department
chairman last spring.
The instructor, Michel
Langinieux, has charged that
Michael Barry, chairman of the
department of speech and drama,
changed three grades of F to B's
in the one-unit movement course,
Speech and Drama 265 C, without
Langinieux's knowledge or
permission. (Langinieux makes
this charge in the letters section,
p. 2 in today's Daily.)

Barry told the Daily last night
that he "accepted responsibility,
as chairman of the department,
for the action." He had stated
earlier that "since University
statutes say that no one has the
right to change the grades" given
by an instructor, "the grades were
restored" to T for all three
students.
All parties asked that the stu
dents involved remain anonymous.
Departmental Problems
The speech and drama
department has in recent times
been plagued with financial and
administrative problems. The
department was without a
chairman for nearly two years
after which Barry was named last
spring.
The orientation and staffing of
the department have been part of
the controversy. It erupted briefly
last spring when Barry, then
chairman-designate, terminated
the appointment of Paul Rebillot
as an instructor in the
department.
Barry dismissed Rebillot on the
grounds that he was a "disruptive
influence" in the department.
Shortly afterwards, Langinieux
resigned his position in the
department, due partly to this
incident.
Langinieux, who held the
position of lecturer, stated that he
discovered the alteration this
summer in the Registrar's Office
after "suspecting" that such a
change would be made.

He explained that his signed,
end-quarter report had been
altered and filed with the
Registrar with no indication that
the change of three grades had
been made.
Protested to Officials
After this discovery,
Langinieux wrote letters of
protest to various University
officials, including Associate Dean
of Humanities and Sciences,
Lawrence Ryan and President
Kenneth Pitzer.
The grades have since been
restored.
