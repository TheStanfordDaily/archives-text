## Strange Grade Change 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Three of the grades of my
speech and Drama 265 C class have
been altered from F's to B's
without my knowing, and under
my signature.

Chairman Barry of the drama
department has admitted the
falsification. The grades have been
restored now.
The fact remains that this
unfortunate action can happen at
Stanford University. Simple
decency toward the rights of the
instructor, and respect for the
value of what work is, does not
allow me to accept so easily Mr.
Barry's immature behavior.
The case has been known only
by a few persons, mainly members
of the search committee
connected with Mr. Barry's
appointment, registrar Harvey
Hall, and President Pitzer. I am
bringing it now to the attention of
my faculty senate- and the student
body.

Commemoration
Editor, THE DAILY:
April and May 1970 will mark
the thirtieth anniversary of one of
the greatest crimes in modern
history: The Katyn Forest
Massacre of more than 4,000
Polish officers, prisoners of war in
Soviet camps.
The more than 4,000 Polish
officers whose bodies were found
in the mass graves at Katyn,
U.S.S.R., constitute only a part of
the more than 15,000 Polish
officers murdered on Stalin's
behest. The massacre was carried
out by the Soviet NKVD. At
Katyn, only those Polish officers
were murdered who came from
the Soviet P.O.W. camp at
Kozielsk. The remaining 11,000
were killed in the vicinity of their
camps, Starobielsk and Ostashkov
as well as in the White Sea where
they had been put on barges
which then were shelled and sunk
by the NKVD.
The American Congress spent
almost two years investigating the
Katyn Massacre and—to a certain
degree— the murder of the
remaining 11,000 Polish officers
whose bodies have not yet been
found. The "Select House
Committee to Investigate The
Katyn Forest Massacre"
(Chairman: Ray J. Madden of
Indiana) which investigated the
Soviet crime in 1951/52, not only
in the U.S. but also in Europe, did
not leave any doubt about the real
perpetrators of the massacre of
the Polish prisoners of war in
Soviet camps: Stalin and his
NKVD.
The thirtieth anniversary of the
Katyn massacre should be
commemorated by the American
people.
I, therefore, submit the
following suggestions:
1) A national gift from the
American people to the Polish
people in form of a monument to
he errected in Warsaw with the
sole inscription: "In Memory of
the 4,243 Polish Patriots
murdered at Katyn, U.S.S.R."
2) An International Katyn
Conference to be sponsored by
one of our Universities. Among
the guests to be invited to address
the Conference should be General
Anders and the seven former
members of the American Select
House Committee to Investigate
The Katyn Forest Massacre.
3) A Katyn Exhibition which
should display the documents
proving the Stalinist crime,
photographs of the open mass
graves at Katyn, the seven
volumes of the Katyn record, as
published by the Congressional
Committee.
4) The issuance of a Katyn
Memorial Stamp.

Stanford University
Academic Freedom
Editor, THE DAILY:
Academic Freedom at Stanford
curled up its toes and died on
August 13, 1969. On that date a
student was denied admission to a
lecture on political grounds.

The occasion was a session of
the Stanford University
Electronics Research Review, a
conference given on campus this
summer by the Electrical
Engineering Department. An
article in the Daily the day before
the conference began announced
that Dr. Rambo (Stanford's
leading electronic warfare
researcher) would be speaking,
and that sessions were open to the
public. I went to the Physics tank
at 9:00 to hear the lecture, but
my entrance was blocked by a
group of plainclothesmen wearing
little blue badges. I had to
"register" before entering. Over at
the registration desk a very kind
LOL explained that the hall was
"full" of people who had
preregistered for the conference,
but that after the midmorning
break there would be room. I
borrowed a schedule and found
that a pattern-recognition device
for the blind was being
demonstrated during the first
session; I was interested in this
because it is televant to my grad
uate study in physiological
psychology. But I couldn't get in,
so after waiting for a few more
minutes I left.
That afternoon I returned,
noping to get into a session on
Digital Systems and parallel
processing, but not optimistic
about my chances. The LOL
asked to see my student ID and
immediately gave me a little blue
badge! I attended the session. Less
than 50 people, including the
speakers, were present. Later I
asked a crew-cut Navy researcher
what had happened in the
morning, and he asked, "Inside or
outside?". I said "Inside," and he
said that nothing had happened,
and the hall was about half full.
Later I talked to Dean Pettit
about the affair. He was quite civil
and apologized that I could not
attend the pattern-recognition
lecture, but he defended his
"right" to close the session
because of the "possibility of a
disruption". He compared it to
the closing of a conference on a
psychiatric patient at the Medical
Center or his right to close his
office door while talking with me.
I still fail to see the parallel to a
lecture given in a large
auditorium. Dean Pettit's attitude
toward radicals was obvious.
When I said that I didn't know the
student who had written the Daily
article announcing the conference,
he said. "You're lucky".
I resent being lied to, and I
resent being excluded from an
on-campus lecture when room was
available. The puspose of a
campus is free and open exchange
of ideas, even where a "possibility
of disruption" exists. Stanford
needs an explicit "Open door"
policy, so that students will not
be denied access to lectures
because their politics might be
unapproved. Closed conferences
should be held off campus, or
better yet should not be held at
all.

Jumping For Joy
Editor, THE DAILY:
The SDS and the Chaparral
should be jumping for joy at this
moment; only approximately 10%
of the Freshman class got caught
up in the Freshman Inquisition.
The "FI," for those in (the)
audience not familiar with the
New Left Dialect, was the recent
demographic test given to
Freshmen by the ACE—an
organization which the SDS notes
accusingly is directed by President
Pitzer among others. (A
conspiracy of the Educational
Establishment?)
It is imminent that the SDS will
argue that it was their and
Chaparral's arguments against the
radical sniffing test that led to
such a low percentage of
participants. The real reason for
the slim participation must
therefore be revealed now.

The Freshmen are lazy. The
Freshmen were not concerned
with being caught in a witch hunt.
They just did not want to get up
at 9:00 in the morning; a rather
early hour, if you retired the night
before at 4 A.M. The normal
Freshman argument: it isn't
required; why bother to go?
There were of course a few,
maybe quite a few, who were
afraid that Joe McCarthy had
risen from his grave and had come
back to haunt Stanford. But they
were not the majority, at least not
in my dorm. The Freshmen are
just a little bit too smart for that,
friends.
