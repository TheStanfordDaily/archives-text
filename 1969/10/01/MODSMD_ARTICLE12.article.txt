The Study of Education at
Stanford after spending 2 years
looking into the problems of
graduate education concluded by
recommending that: "The
president .. . should appoint a
Commission on Graduate
Education charged with
conducting a study of Stanford's
problems in graduate education,
with especial emphasis on Ph.D.
programs." What progress! I had
the pleasure of reading thru
several drafts of the SES report.
Each draft grew shorter, less
critical, and more speculative.
Hard hitting statements such as
that of University Fellow Marc
Mancall found their way into the
Appendix. (In fact, the report has
only 23 pages of text, but almost
100 pages .of appendices.)
Here is a delightful quote from
Mancall's statement: "Having
worked toward the degree by
taking a requisite number of units,
fulfilling specified requirements,
achieving a certain grade average,
passing qualifying examinations,
and writing an often turgid and
crushingly boring dissertation that
passes as an "original contribution
to knowledge," the graduate
student, his imagination probably
restricted and dulled, his mind
perhaps withered and exhausted,
his soul jaded, dreamless, and
unwondering, his enthusiasm gone
with his youth, is suddenly
transformed by the magic of a
degree into an educator charged
with the responsibility of
imparting to those who come
after him the excitement of
learning and a sense of the
adventure of ideas. Often he leads
them no further than into the
intricacies of the footnote."
The report sidesteps the issue
of departmental autonomy which
is the stumbling block to
innovation at the undergraduate
level as well as the graduate.
Faculty have more or less
accepted the notion that
undergraduate education needs
some loosening up, and this has
partly overridden vested interest.
Yet the language departments are
still fighting the end of the
language requirement, and
the engineering faculty are fighting
against SES recommendations for
a semester system, the
replacement of the unit-credit
system with a course-credit
system, and strict limitations on
the number of courses a
department can require.
There is no comparable
acceptance of the notion that
something is wrong with graduate
education. While Stanford
graduates the vast majority of its
undergraduates, it graduates only
a minority of its doctoral
students. This inefficiency
represents a huge wastes of the
university's resources. The
fundamental irony is that
Stanford cannot substantially
improve undergraduate education
until it has dealt with the
problems of graduate education.
As Jencks and Reisman point
out in their book THE
ACADEMIC REVOLUTION, it is
graduate education that
increasingly acts as a model for
undergraduate teaching. Look at
that marvelous innovation the
FRESHMAN SEMINAR which
gives freshmen access to a real,
live, senior faculty member and at
close quarters. And I do not mean
to downgrade that part of the
experience. But the course itself is
often a junior version of a
graduate seminar where the
professor gets to do his thing; i.e.,
demonstrate the thinking and
insights that went into his latest
journal article. This is a trend
away from the goal of general
education and towards narrow,
specialized education. Sometimes
the professor will even allow his
freshmen to help him with his
research. They glean from this
exchange the experience of having
participated in the great research
enterprise, and the professor gets
free labor. (I should point out that
while SES recommends that
graduate student "teaching should
extend beyond leading discussion
sections to include other valuable
experiences such as preparing and
delivering lectures, conducting a
tutorial, and participating on a
panel," they were purged from
the freshmen seminar program
after having played a large part in
making it a success during its
experimental years.)
One thing that is needed in
many departments is a drastic cut
in graduate enrollments. I doubt
that this would produce a
corresponding drop in the number
of Ph.D.'s produced. In spite of
the claim at Stanford that tuition

only pays for roughly half of the
cost of education—Dave Harris
used to say that it was only worth
half the cost and he may have
been too optimistic—what really
happens is that two poor suckers
who don't graduate help pay for
the third who gets his doctorate
(of course, it is often the
government or the Ford
Foundation that gets suckered).
Certainly undergraduates help
carry the financial burden of
graduate education, and see far
less of their professors than they
might, because so much of their
time is taken up with graduate
education.
Interdisciplinary Programs
The most interesting and
serious questions often lie across
and between academic areas.
Many of the problems which face
our country: pollution, racism,
poverty, and urban decay do not
fall within traditional academic
bounds. If academics are to be at
all connected to the real world,
RELEVANT, then we must create

many new interdisciplinary
programs. Stanford is not doing
this quickly or with enthusiasm.
Partly this is a natural
conservatism in a tradition-bound
institution. It is also the result of
jealously guarded departmental
and faculty autonomy, as well as
rigid and often arbitrary
boundaries closing off one
discipline from another. The
power of the faculty is arranged
by those disciplines. This means
that as a unit the faculty is against
new problems, new a.eas of study,
educational change. To overcome
the vested interest of the faculty
is going to take unremitting
pressure and education. But God
save us from another committee
that will recommend another
committee that will recommend
another committee.
