# Housing Problem
## Coyote Hill Concern 
### Vic Von Schlegell 
Conservationists, mainly from
the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Stanford
Conservation Group, and groups
in the Palo Alto/Stanford area
whose main concern is for low
and moderate income housing,
have seen their interests dovetail
in the last few months. The center
of the controversy is Coyote Hill,
the most recent in the remarkable
industrial and commercial
developments on Stanford lands.
Coyote Hill is a 255 acre area
zoned in 1960 by the City of Palo
Alto as LM:S (light industrial and
manufacturing, with a 5 acre
minimum on developments). It is
expected, according to Alf
Brandin, Vice President for
Business Affairs, to bring $4
million to the endowment of the
University, and nearly a million
dollars to Palo Alto, the County,
and others in the form of taxes.
The other 600 acres of the Park
brought almost $2 million to
Stanford last year.
The Industrial Park (SIP)
development was begun around
1950, with Brandin and the
then-Provost Frederick Terman
leading the development. The first
lease (Stanford's lands are part of
the University endowment, and
cannot be sold) was extended to
Varian Associates, whose lease
was for only one year—the SIP
was not the prestigious industrial
area it is today. Until 1962, leases
were primarily for 99 years, but in
1962, the Board of Trustees set
the maximum at 51 years, which
is where tt.<. limit stands today.
There are currently some 60
tenants in the SIP, predominantly
in the scientific, technical, and
research fields, employing more
than 20,000 people.
It was business as usual in the
SIP until 1960, when the
University sought to annex the
Coyote Hill area to the City. The
City Council approved the
annexation, but a referendum was
held at the end of that year,
sponsored by conservationists
who wanted to appeal the City
Council's decision to annex the
area with an industrial zoning.
The vote upheld the City
Council's decision by a 51-49
margin.
Ampex Corporation
The annexation was sought by
the University because of plans by
Ampex Corporation for an
industrial development in the
area. The literature which
supported annexation dwelt upon
the Ampex project, even though
the issue before the voters
concerned the issue surrounding
the zoning of the area. Many in
the community feel that the vote
for annexation was made on the
basis of the Ampex plan, which
was juxtaposed with alternatives
such as tract housing and
"benched and scarred hillsides" in
the literature. But the Ampex deal
fell through, and Coyote Hill
development did not take place.
In 1967, the Palo Alto City
Council again supported the
Coyote Hill zoning, but also asked
the Palo Alto Planning
Commission to look into the
possibility of alternate zoning for
the area. Concurrent with these
discussions was a move for a study
of the foothill area, which
resulted in a $144,000 study
commissioned by the City
through Livingston-Blaney, a
Foothill environmental design
study. In a letter to the City from
Robert Riley, the then-Director of
Real Estate for the University, the
Coyote Hill area was excluded by
inference—that is, Riley wrote
that the University would be
happy to have the study include
the Stanford lands which were not
already zoned for a purpose, or,
Coyote Hill.
Last spring, roads A and B were
begun on Coyote Hill, even
though they had not been
approved by the City Council or
the Planning Commission. This
road construction, as well as the
initial lot division in Parcel D,
came under a Charter delegation
to the City's planning staff, which

permitted the staff to allow such
activity without approval—and
therefore, without public hearing
or notice.
Housing Study
Also last spring was the
publication of the Low Cost
Housing Committee's study,
which was initiated by the Acting
President, Robert Glaser. The
study stated that Stanford's land
development policy has been a
direct cause for the lack of
housing in the Palo Alto area, and
suggested that the University
begin immediate study into
construction of low cost housing.
Housing was raised as an issue by
groups off campus as well; the
Mid-Penninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing for example, was in the
process of trying to convince Palo
Alto to use the Corporation Yard,
land leased to the City by
Stanford, for a limited low cost
housing site.
But by the end of the summer,
both the conservationists, who
wanted the University to delay
construction on the Coyote Hill
lands until alternate uses could be
investigated and the
Livingston-Blaney study could
offer guidelines for development,
and the low cost housing groups,
who wanted to be assured that
Palo Alto was intent on making
low cost housing available in the
foreseeable future, were
disappointed. The University,
while it had agreed not to develop
the top 30 acres of the Hill, went
right along with the process of
dividing and subdividing the area,
a process which ended early in
September, when the City Council
approved the tentative division
maps by a 5-4 vote. To the low
cost housing group, both the
University and Palo Alto (through
a non-profit corporation made up
primarily of business interests)
offered action-oriented studies of
the problem. But both the
University and Palo Alto are using
figures which may well be too
low, especially when one
considers the demand for housing
in an area with a vacancy rate of
less than 1%.
So despite the controversy
which has erupted over the
development, plans are now in the
works for at least two firms for
Coyote Hill: Fairchild and
Computer Time Sharing
Corporation, with another firm,
Measurex, a little farther behind
in planning. When the area is
completely developed, one might
expect an additional 3-5,000 new
jobs, using the figures of
jobs-per-acre in the lower SIP.
What this will do to the housing
situation can only be estimated,
but it is certain that the strain can
only grow worse.
In its last meeting, the
Committee on Land and Building
Development (Advisory to the
President) voted 4-3 against a
three month moratorium in the
area—a moratorium which would
be used to gather available
information about housing and
conservation as they relate to the
area. Since the Committee,
chaired by Professor William
Rambo, is only advisory, the
concept of the moratorium is not
finished with its failure in
committee; rather, it is still
possible to influence the President
with respect to the Coyote Hill
development. Members of the
Stanford community are urged to
support the moratorium, and to
inform the President's Office of
that support. Coyote Hill plays at
least a symbolic, but more
realistically, a central role in the
future of Stanford land
development; control by those
whose concern is for adequate low
cost housing and conservation of
the University's endowment
should be voiced before the
development approaches
completion.

such as tract housing and
"benched and scarred hillsides" in
the literature. But the Ampex deal
fell through, and Coyote Hill
development did not take place.
In 1967, the Palo Alto City
Council again supported the
Coyote Hill zoning, but also asked
the Palo Alto Planning
Commission to look into the
possibility of alternate zoning for
the area. Concurrent with these
discussions was a move for a study
of the foothill area, which
resulted in a $144,000 study
commissioned by the City
through Livingston-Blaney, a
Foothill environmental design
study. In a letter to the City from
Robert Riley, the then-Director of
Real Estate for the University, the
Coyote Hill area was excluded by
inference—that is, Riley wrote
that the University would be
happy to have the study include
the Stanford lands which were not
already zoned for a purpose, or,
Coyote Hill.
Last spring, roads A and B were
begun on Coyote Hill, even
though they had not been
approved by the City Council or
the Planning Commission. This
road construction, as well as the
initial lot division in Parcel D,
came under a Charter delegation
to the City's planning staff, which

permitted the staff to allow such
activity without approval—and
therefore, without public hearing
or notice.
Housing Study
Also last spring was the
publication of the Low Cost
Housing Committee's study,
which was initiated by the Acting
President, Robert Glaser. The
study stated that Stanford's land
development policy has been a
direct cause for the lack of
housing in the Palo Alto area, and
suggested that the University
begin immediate study into
construction of low cost housing.
Housing was raised as an issue by
groups off campus as well; the
Mid-Penninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing for example, was in the
process of trying to convince Palo
Alto to use the Corporation Yard,
land leased to the City by
Stanford, for a limited low cost
housing site.
But by the end of the summer,
both the conservationists, who
wanted the University to delay
construction on the Coyote Hill
lands until alternate uses could be
investigated and the
Livingston-Blaney study could
offer guidelines for development,
and the low cost housing groups,
who wanted to be assured that
Palo Alto was intent on making
low cost housing available in the
foreseeable future, were
disappointed. The University,
while it had agreed not to develop
the top 30 acres of the Hill, went
right along with the process of
dividing and subdividing the area,
a process which ended early in
September, when the City Council
approved the tentative division
maps by a 5-4 vote. To the low
cost housing group, both the
University and Palo Alto (through
a non-profit corporation made up
primarily of business interests)
offered action-oriented studies of
the problem. But both the
University and Palo Alto are using
figures which may well be too
low, especially when one
considers the demand for housing
in an area with a vacancy rate of
less than 1%.
So despite the controversy
which has erupted over the
development, plans are now in the
works for at least two firms for
Coyote Hill: Fairchild and
Computer Time Sharing
Corporation, with another firm,
Measurex, a little farther behind
in planning. When the area is
completely developed, one might
expect an additional 3-5,000 new
jobs, using the figures of
jobs-per-acre in the lower SIP.
What this will do to the housing
situation can only be estimated,
but it is certain that the strain can
only grow worse.
In its last meeting, the
Committee on Land and Building
Development (Advisory to the
President) voted 4-3 against a
three month moratorium in the
area—a moratorium which would
be used to gather available
information about housing and
conservation as they relate to the
area. Since the Committee,
chaired by Professor William
Rambo, is only advisory, the
concept of the moratorium is not
finished with its failure in
committee; rather, it is still
possible to influence the President
with respect to the Coyote Hill
development. Members of the
Stanford community are urged to
support the moratorium, and to
inform the President's Office of
that support. Coyote Hill plays at
least a symbolic, but more
realistically, a central role in the
future of Stanford land
development; control by those
whose concern is for adequate low
cost housing and conservation of
the University's endowment
should be voiced before the
development approaches
completion.

student body vice-president, and
now a graduate student in

Conservationists, mainly from
the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Stanford
Conservation Group, and groups
in the Palo Alto/Stanford area
whose main concern is for low
and moderate income housing,
have seen their interests dovetail
in the last few months. The center
of the controversy is Coyote Hill,
the most recent in the remarkable
industrial and commercial
developments on Stanford lands.
Coyote Hill is a 255 acre area
zoned in 1960 by the City of Palo
Alto as LM:S (light industrial and
manufacturing, with a 5 acre
minimum on developments). It is
expected, according to Alf
Brandin, Vice President for
Business Affairs, to bring $4
million to the endowment of the
University, and nearly a million
dollars to Palo Alto, the County,
and others in the form of taxes.
The other 600 acres of the Park
brought almost $2 million to
Stanford last year.
The Industrial Park (SIP)
development was begun around
1950, with Brandin and the
then-Provost Frederick Terman
leading the development. The first
lease (Stanford's lands are part of
the University endowment, and
cannot be sold) was extended to
Varian Associates, whose lease
was for only one year—the SIP
was not the prestigious industrial
area it is today. Until 1962, leases
were primarily for 99 years, but in
1962, the Board of Trustees set
the maximum at 51 years, which
is where tt.<. limit stands today.
There are currently some 60
tenants in the SIP, predominantly
in the scientific, technical, and
research fields, employing more
than 20,000 people.
It was business as usual in the
SIP until 1960, when the
University sought to annex the
Coyote Hill area to the City. The
City Council approved the
annexation, but a referendum was
held at the end of that year,
sponsored by conservationists
who wanted to appeal the City
Council's decision to annex the
area with an industrial zoning.
The vote upheld the City
Council's decision by a 51-49
margin.
Ampex Corporation
The annexation was sought by
the University because of plans by
Ampex Corporation for an
industrial development in the
area. The literature which
supported annexation dwelt upon
the Ampex project, even though
the issue before the voters
concerned the issue surrounding
the zoning of the area. Many in
the community feel that the vote
for annexation was made on the
basis of the Ampex plan, which
was juxtaposed with alternatives
such as tract housing and
"benched and scarred hillsides" in

approved the tentative division
maps by a 5-4 vote. To the low
cost housing group, both the
University and Palo Alto (through
a non-profit corporation made up
primarily of business interests)
offered action-oriented studies of
the problem. But both the
University and Palo Alto are using
figures which may well be too
low, especially when one
considers the demand for housing
in an area with a vacancy rate of
less than 1%.
So despite the controversy
which has erupted over the
development, plans are now in the
works for at least two firms for
Coyote Hill: Fairchild and
Computer Time Sharing
Corporation, with another firm,
Measurex, a little farther behind
in planning. When the area is
completely developed, one might
expect an additional 3-5,000 new
jobs, using the figures of
jobs-per-acre in the lower SIP.
What this will do to the housing
situation can only be estimated,
but it is certain that the strain can
only grow worse.
In its last meeting, the
Committee on Land and Building
Development (Advisory to the
President) voted 4-3 against a
three month moratorium in the
area—a moratorium which would
be used to gather available
information about housing and
conservation as they relate to the
area. Since the Committee,
chaired by Professor William
Rambo, is only advisory, the
concept of the moratorium is not
finished with its failure in
committee; rather, it is still
possible to influence the President
with respect to the Coyote Hill
development. Members of the
Stanford community are urged to
support the moratorium, and to
inform the President's Office of
that support. Coyote Hill plays at
least a symbolic, but more
realistically, a central role in the
future of Stanford land
development; control by those
whose concern is for adequate low
cost housing and conservation of
the University's endowment
should be voiced before the
development approaches
completion.

Conservationists, mainly from
the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Stanford
Conservation Group, and groups
in the Palo Alto/Stanford area
whose main concern is for low
and moderate income housing,
have seen their interests dovetail
in the last few months. The center
of the controversy is Coyote Hill,
the most recent in the remarkable
industrial and commercial
developments on Stanford lands.
Coyote Hill is a 255 acre area
zoned in 1960 by the City of Palo
Alto as LM:S (light industrial and
manufacturing, with a 5 acre
minimum on developments). It is
expected, according to Alf
Brandin, Vice President for
Business Affairs, to bring $4
million to the endowment of the
University, and nearly a million
dollars to Palo Alto, the County,
and others in the form of taxes.
The other 600 acres of the Park
brought almost $2 million to
Stanford last year.
The Industrial Park (SIP)
development was begun around
1950, with Brandin and the
then-Provost Frederick Terman
leading the development. The first
lease (Stanford's lands are part of
the University endowment, and
cannot be sold) was extended to
Varian Associates, whose lease
was for only one year—the SIP
was not the prestigious industrial
area it is today. Until 1962, leases
were primarily for 99 years, but in
1962, the Board of Trustees set
the maximum at 51 years, which
is where tt.<. limit stands today.
There are currently some 60
tenants in the SIP, predominantly
in the scientific, technical, and
research fields, employing more
than 20,000 people.
It was business as usual in the
SIP until 1960, when the
University sought to annex the
Coyote Hill area to the City. The
City Council approved the
annexation, but a referendum was
held at the end of that year,
sponsored by conservationists
who wanted to appeal the City
Council's decision to annex the
area with an industrial zoning.
The vote upheld the City
Council's decision by a 51-49
margin.
Ampex Corporation
The annexation was sought by
the University because of plans by
Ampex Corporation for an
industrial development in the
area. The literature which
supported annexation dwelt upon
the Ampex project, even though
the issue before the voters
concerned the issue surrounding
the zoning of the area. Many in
the community feel that the vote
for annexation was made on the
basis of the Ampex plan, which
was juxtaposed with alternatives
such as tract housing and
"benched and scarred hillsides" in
the literature. But the Ampex deal
fell through, and Coyote Hill
development did not take place.
In 1967, the Palo Alto City
Council again supported the
Coyote Hill zoning, but also asked
the Palo Alto Planning
Commission to look into the
possibility of alternate zoning for
the area. Concurrent with these
discussions was a move for a study
of the foothill area, which
resulted in a $144,000 study
commissioned by the City
through Livingston-Blaney, a
Foothill environmental design
study. In a letter to the City from
Robert Riley, the then-Director of
Real Estate for the University, the
Coyote Hill area was excluded by
inference—that is, Riley wrote
that the University would be
happy to have the study include
the Stanford lands which were not
already zoned for a purpose, or,
Coyote Hill.
Last spring, roads A and B were
begun on Coyote Hill, even
though they had not been
approved by the City Council or
the Planning Commission. This
road construction, as well as the
initial lot division in Parcel D,
came under a Charter delegation
to the City's planning staff, which

permitted the staff to allow such
activity without approval—and
therefore, without public hearing
or notice.
Housing Study
Also last spring was the
publication of the Low Cost
Housing Committee's study,
which was initiated by the Acting
President, Robert Glaser. The
study stated that Stanford's land
development policy has been a
direct cause for the lack of
housing in the Palo Alto area, and
suggested that the University
begin immediate study into
construction of low cost housing.
Housing was raised as an issue by
groups off campus as well; the
Mid-Penninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing for example, was in the
process of trying to convince Palo
Alto to use the Corporation Yard,
land leased to the City by
Stanford, for a limited low cost
housing site.
But by the end of the summer,
both the conservationists, who
wanted the University to delay
construction on the Coyote Hill
lands until alternate uses could be
investigated and the
Livingston-Blaney study could
offer guidelines for development,
and the low cost housing groups,
who wanted to be assured that
Palo Alto was intent on making
low cost housing available in the
foreseeable future, were
disappointed. The University,
while it had agreed not to develop
the top 30 acres of the Hill, went
right along with the process of
dividing and subdividing the area,
a process which ended early in
September, when the City Council
approved the tentative division
maps by a 5-4 vote. To the low
cost housing group, both the
University and Palo Alto (through
a non-profit corporation made up
primarily of business interests)

minimum on developments). It is
expected, according to Alf
Brandin, Vice President for
Business Affairs, to bring $4
million to the endowment of the
University, and nearly a million
dollars to Palo Alto, the County,
and others in the form of taxes.
The other 600 acres of the Park
brought almost $2 million to
Stanford last year.
The Industrial Park (SIP)
development was begun around
1950, with Brandin and the
then-Provost Frederick Terman
leading the development. The first
lease (Stanford's lands are part of
the University endowment, and
cannot be sold) was extended to
Varian Associates, whose lease
was for only one year—the SIP
was not the prestigious industrial
area it is today. Until 1962, leases
were primarily for 99 years, but in
1962, the Board of Trustees set
the maximum at 51 years, which
is where tt.<. limit stands today.
There are currently some 60
tenants in the SIP, predominantly
in the scientific, technical, and
research fields, employing more
than 20,000 people.
It was business as usual in the
SIP until 1960, when the
University sought to annex the
Coyote Hill area to the City. The
City Council approved the
annexation, but a referendum was
held at the end of that year,
sponsored by conservationists
who wanted to appeal the City
Council's decision to annex the
area with an industrial zoning.
The vote upheld the City
Council's decision by a 51-49
margin.
Ampex Corporation
The annexation was sought by
the University because of plans by
Ampex Corporation for an
industrial development in the
area. The literature which
supported annexation dwelt upon
the Ampex project, even though
the issue before the voters
concerned the issue surrounding
the zoning of the area. Many in
the community feel that the vote
for annexation was made on the
basis of the Ampex plan, which
was juxtaposed with alternatives
such as tract housing and
"benched and scarred hillsides" in
the literature. But the Ampex deal
fell through, and Coyote Hill
development did not take place.
In 1967, the Palo Alto City
Council again supported the
Coyote Hill zoning, but also asked
the Palo Alto Planning
Commission to look into the
possibility of alternate zoning for
the area. Concurrent with these
discussions was a move for a study
of the foothill area, which
resulted in a $144,000 study
commissioned by the City
through Livingston-Blaney, a
Foothill environmental design
study. In a letter to the City from
Robert Riley, the then-Director of
Real Estate for the University, the
Coyote Hill area was excluded by
inference—that is, Riley wrote
that the University would be
happy to have the study include
the Stanford lands which were not
already zoned for a purpose, or,
Coyote Hill.
Last spring, roads A and B were
begun on Coyote Hill, even
though they had not been
approved by the City Council or
the Planning Commission. This
road construction, as well as the
initial lot division in Parcel D,
came under a Charter delegation
to the City's planning staff, which

permitted the staff to allow such
activity without approval—and
therefore, without public hearing
or notice.
Housing Study
Also last spring was the
publication of the Low Cost
Housing Committee's study,
which was initiated by the Acting
President, Robert Glaser. The
study stated that Stanford's land
development policy has been a
direct cause for the lack of
housing in the Palo Alto area, and
suggested that the University
begin immediate study into
construction of low cost housing.
Housing was raised as an issue by
groups off campus as well; the
Mid-Penninsula Citizens for Fair
Housing for example, was in the
process of trying to convince Palo
Alto to use the Corporation Yard,
land leased to the City by
Stanford, for a limited low cost
housing site.
But by the end of the summer,
both the conservationists, who
wanted the University to delay
construction on the Coyote Hill
lands until alternate uses could be
investigated and the
Livingston-Blaney study could
offer guidelines for development,
and the low cost housing groups,
who wanted to be assured that
Palo Alto was intent on making
low cost housing available in the
foreseeable future, were
disappointed. The University,
while it had agreed not to develop
the top 30 acres of the Hill, went
right along with the process of
dividing and subdividing the area,
a process which ended early in
September, when the City Council
approved the tentative division
maps by a 5-4 vote. To the low
cost housing group, both the
University and Palo Alto (through
a non-profit corporation made up
primarily of business interests)
offered action-oriented studies of
the problem. But both the
University and Palo Alto are using
figures which may well be too
low, especially when one
considers the demand for housing
in an area with a vacancy rate of
less than 1%.
So despite the controversy
which has erupted over the
development, plans are now in the
works for at least two firms for
Coyote Hill: Fairchild and
Computer Time Sharing
Corporation, with another firm,
Measurex, a little farther behind
in planning. When the area is
completely developed, one might
expect an additional 3-5,000 new
jobs, using the figures of
jobs-per-acre in the lower SIP.
What this will do to the housing
situation can only be estimated,
but it is certain that the strain can
only grow worse.
In its last meeting, the
Committee on Land and Building
Development (Advisory to the
President) voted 4-3 against a
three month moratorium in the
area—a moratorium which would
be used to gather available
information about housing and
conservation as they relate to the
area. Since the Committee,
chaired by Professor William
Rambo, is only advisory, the
concept of the moratorium is not
finished with its failure in
committee; rather, it is still
possible to influence the President
with respect to the Coyote Hill
development. Members of the
Stanford community are urged to
support the moratorium, and to
inform the President's Office of
that support. Coyote Hill plays at
least a symbolic, but more
realistically, a central role in the
future of Stanford land
development; control by those
whose concern is for adequate low
cost housing and conservation of
the University's endowment
should be voiced before the
development approaches
completion.

Conservationists, mainly from
the Committee for Green
Foothills and the Stanford
Conservation Group, and groups
in the Palo Alto/Stanford area
whose main concern is for low
and moderate income housing,
have seen their interests dovetail
in the last few months. The center
of the controversy is Coyote Hill,
the most recent in the remarkable
industrial and commercial
developments on Stanford lands.
Coyote Hill is a 255 acre area
zoned in 1960 by the City of Palo
Alto as LM:S (light industrial and
manufacturing, with a 5 acre
minimum on developments). It is
expected, according to Alf
Brandin, Vice President for
Business Affairs, to bring $4
million to the endowment of the
University, and nearly a million
dollars to Palo Alto, the County,
and others in the form of taxes.
