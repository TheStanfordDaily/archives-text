# Aftermath Of S.F. State Strike : Repression
## 
###

San Francisco Slate Legal Defense
Committee appealing for greater
awareness of the continuing trials of
those arrested during the San Francisco
State strikes—Ed. |
Dear brothers and sisters:
Last year the strike at San
Francisco State made headlines in
the mass, college and movement
media for over 4 months. As you
well know, the demands that were
raised by the Third World
Liberation Front have had
national significance, both for the
student movement and for third
world groups around the country.
However, when the strike was
over, little attention was paid to
the aftermath of the strike—the
political repression of the strikers.
The repression has taken place
on two fronts: on the campus and
in the courts.
Ilayakawa
On the campus, Hayakawa has
subjected the new School of Third
World Studies to incredible
administrative restrictions, which
have resulted in qualified teachers
chosen by third world students,
faculty and community groups
being denied teaching positions
because of their participation in
the strike; in an emasculated
curriculum due to the refusal of
the administration to provide
financial resources for the
program; in the systematic
exclusion of third world students
from the college under the Equal
Opportunities Program; and in the
refusal of Hayakawa and the

Attorney General to release the
student funds which the Third
World Liberation Front
community action programs need
for their survival.
In the courts, the repression has
been ever heavier. Strikers are
being sentenced to six months in
jail for their participation in the
rally on the campus last January
23rd that resulted in a mass bust
of over 435 people. The judges
and the D.A.'s have fully
cooperated in the effort to ensure
that the juries cannot decide on
the facts of the case, but rather on
their fears of "student violence"
and "campus disruption." With
135 individual trials still pending,
including most of the felonies and
all the trials of the Third World
Liberation Front leadership, we
can expect that the political
repression in the courts will
increase.
The State strikers are certainly
not an isolated case of political
repression. We all know that the
U.S. government is engaged in a
systematic attempt to exterminate
the entire Black Panther Party;
and that the present conspiracy
trials in Chicago mark a big jump
in the repression of the anti-war
movement.
Exposure
We of the S.F. State Legal
Defense Committee believe that it
is time for the movement to
address itself to an understanding
and an exposure of the nature and
function of the judicial system:
who laws are made to protect,

how the enforcement of laws is
used to repress the forces
struggling for political change,
and, most important, how to
begin to fight—inside and outside
the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its
entirety, because we feel that it is
vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.

[Below are reprinted exerpts
from a recent article by Sharon
Gold which appeared in the DOCK
OF THE BAY,local radical weekly.
At 12 noon, on January 23,
1969, a thousand strikers and
strike supporters gathered at a
rally in the middle of San
Francisco State's campus. The
rally lasted only 25 minutes when
the police surrounded and busted
435 of us, charging us with three
misdemeanors: disturbing the

peace, failure to dispense, and
unlawful assembly.
So far, 20 groups—l 67
people—have gone to trial. Of
these people, accused of the same
charges for the same act, with
identical evidence brought against
them:
42 have been acquitted of
all 3 charges;
35 received mixed hung juries
and acquittals, some have been
retried, others had charges
dropped;
31 were convicted of one or
two charges;
66 were convicted of all 3
charges.
The usual cost of an appeal
bond in a misdemeanor cast is
twice the amount of the original
bail. Bail was set for most of the
mass bust arrestees at $350 per
person. But the judges are setting
the majority of appeal bonds at
anywhere from $1500 to $6250,
in an attempt to intimidate us
from appealing the convictions.
Political Trials
As the Movement increases in
strength, the State steps up its use
of the courts as a major tool of
repression. "Impartial" trials are a
fantasy as more and more
decisions are handed down for
political reasons.
Broadly defined, all criminal
trials of poor people, third world
people and youth can be called
political trials for two main
reasons. First, because these
groups of people are the most
severely exploited by the political
and economic institutions of a
capitalist society. Second, the
decision to prosecute some crimes
and dismiss others is a political
decision.
A political trial is one in which
an individual or group is selected
for criminal prosecution for
actions that stem out of their
political beliefs. Categorizing the
charges as misdemeanor or felony
is incidental to the political
action.
The major differences between
the two kinds of charges is that
the jail penalty on a felony is
much higher than on a
misdemeanor, and that factual
evidence in a felony case tends to
have more relevance to the
outcome of the trial than in a
misdemeanor case.
No Juries of our Peers
For each group trial, about 125
prospective jurors are questioned.
Of these, approximately 8 are
black, one a student, one a young
worker under 25. Our juries are
overwhelmingly white and over
35.
Why can't we get tried by juries
of our peers—third world people,
poor people and youth? First,
because jury lists are selected
from registered voters, and most
of our peers can't affprd to live on
the $6 or $7 a day the city pays
for jury duty, and few employers
will compensate their workers
adequately for performing their
"civic duty." Third, because the
D.A. excludes anyone from sitting
on the jury who might have the
vaguest concern about educational
problems, or the oppression of
third world people.
The list of organizations,

membership in which disqualifies
a juror, according to the D.A.
includes SANE, American Friends
Service Committee, and the
NAACP, as well, of course, as the
strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the
strikers. The assembly wasn't
unlawful because Hayakawa's
edict banning rallies was simply
administrative fiat, not legislative
act. Nobody's peace was
disturbed; nobody filed a
complaint against the strikers for
making Loo much noise. Even thy
D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical
Education and History
departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.
Repression from the Bench
The San Francisco judges have
played a key role in the State's
repression of the strike. Two
weeks after the strike broke out
last November, the judges got
together and decided that no
people arrested at State would be
released on their own
recognizance.
During the mass bust, Judge
Mana unilaterally decided that
none of the 435 would get out on
OR. The result: we had to pay a
total of $70,000 in bail for our
700 brothers and sisters arrested
during the course of the
4 1 /2-month-long strike. Very
profitable for the insurance
companies who get the lion's
share of the bondsman's cut.
According to a Chronicle
editorial of Feb. 6, 1969, all the
judges were called to Sacramento
by East Bay legislator Don
Mulford, to discuss the State
trials. The judges were warned
that their political careers were in
jeopardy if they didn't make sure
that the trials resulted in
convictions and heavy sentences.
During the course of the State
trials, Judges Mana, Merrill and
Calcagno—none of whom have
acquired a reputation for leniency
toward the strikers—have been
promoted to Superior Court
judgeships. A job well done.
The judges find it hard to
restrain their prejudice against the
strikers. Judge Reynolds
introduced his close friend, the
daddy of the D.A., to the jury in
the middle of the trial. Judge
Eyman told the jury that campus

disorders were caused by faculty
who use their position to reach
students disloyalty to American
institutions.
Our Defense
Our defense is on two fronts:
against the charges, and against
the whole court system. Our
strategy to combat the charges
aims at building a political defense
which uses all available means
within the courtroom procedure
to educate the jury about the
politics of the strike, while at the
same time striving to win our
cases so that people don't have to
spend six months in jail for the
crime of attending a rallv.
Up to now, our main emphasis
of defense against the court
system has been the political
education of our lawyers. Because
we have no money to pay lawyers,
we've had to rely almost entirely
on the public defender's office,
and on young lawyers from large
firms who have been designated
by their senior partners to use the
State cases to get some "trial
experience."
The political education of the
lawyers happens in three ways:
First, the defendants educate
them about the politics of the
strike, so they know why we're on
trial.
Second, we try to establish a
new kind of relationship between
lawyers and defendants. The
defendants and the S.F. State
Legal Defense Committee assist
the lawyers at all stages of
preparation for the trials. In
exchange, the lawyers have to
agree that all decisions on trial
strategy will be made mutually by
lawyers and defendants.
Third, the actions of the D.A.'s
and the judges educate the
lawyers about what goes on in a
political trial. Our lawyers have
rapidly lost all illusions they may
have had about the impartiality of
the judicial system.
The court system is the most
powerfully entrenched and
legitimatized institution of
repression in American society.
Movement people on trial cannot
win against the courts in isolation.
Inside the courtroom, we need
to show the lawyers and the jurors
that we are on trial for our
politics, not for our "criminal"
activity. Outside the courtroom,
we need to begin to educate
millions of people about the real
nature of the court system.
Until our courts are controlled
by the people, there will be no
justice for the people.

D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical

departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.
Repression from the Bench
The San Francisco judges have
played a key role in the State's
repression of the strike. Two
weeks after the strike broke out
last November, the judges got
together and decided that no
people arrested at State would be
released on their own
recognizance.
During the mass bust, Judge
Mana unilaterally decided that
none of the 435 would get out on
OR. The result: we had to pay a
total of $70,000 in bail for our
700 brothers and sisters arrested
during the course of the
4 1 /2-month-long strike. Very
profitable for the insurance
companies who get the lion's
share of the bondsman's cut.
According to a Chronicle
editorial of Feb. 6, 1969, all the
judges were called to Sacramento
by East Bay legislator Don
Mulford, to discuss the State
trials. The judges were warned
that their political careers were in
jeopardy if they didn't make sure
that the trials resulted in
convictions and heavy sentences.
During the course of the State
trials, Judges Mana, Merrill and
Calcagno—none of whom have
acquired a reputation for leniency
toward the strikers—have been
promoted to Superior Court
judgeships. A job well done.
The judges find it hard to
restrain their prejudice against the
strikers. Judge Reynolds
introduced his close friend, the
daddy of the D.A., to the jury in
the middle of the trial. Judge
Eyman told the jury that campus

disorders were caused by faculty
who use their position to reach
students disloyalty to American
institutions.
Our Defense
Our defense is on two fronts:
against the charges, and against
the whole court system. Our
strategy to combat the charges
aims at building a political defense
which uses all available means
within the courtroom procedure
to educate the jury about the
politics of the strike, while at the
same time striving to win our
cases so that people don't have to
spend six months in jail for the
crime of attending a rallv.
Up to now, our main emphasis
of defense against the court
system has been the political
education of our lawyers. Because
we have no money to pay lawyers,
we've had to rely almost entirely
on the public defender's office,
and on young lawyers from large
firms who have been designated
by their senior partners to use the
State cases to get some "trial
experience."
The political education of the
lawyers happens in three ways:
First, the defendants educate
them about the politics of the
strike, so they know why we're on
trial.
Second, we try to establish a
new kind of relationship between
lawyers and defendants. The
defendants and the S.F. State
Legal Defense Committee assist
the lawyers at all stages of
preparation for the trials. In
exchange, the lawyers have to
agree that all decisions on trial
strategy will be made mutually by
lawyers and defendants.
Third, the actions of the D.A.'s
and the judges educate the
lawyers about what goes on in a
political trial. Our lawyers have
rapidly lost all illusions they may
have had about the impartiality of
the judicial system.
The court system is the most
powerfully entrenched and
legitimatized institution of
repression in American society.
Movement people on trial cannot
win against the courts in isolation.
Inside the courtroom, we need
to show the lawyers and the jurors
that we are on trial for our
politics, not for our "criminal"
activity. Outside the courtroom,
we need to begin to educate
millions of people about the real
nature of the court system.
Until our courts are controlled
by the people, there will be no
justice for the people.

Committee appealing for greater
awareness of the continuing trials of

State strikes—Ed. |
Dear brothers and sisters:
Last year the strike at San
Francisco State made headlines in
the mass, college and movement
media for over 4 months. As you
well know, the demands that were
raised by the Third World
Liberation Front have had
national significance, both for the
student movement and for third
world groups around the country.
However, when the strike was
over, little attention was paid to
the aftermath of the strike—the
political repression of the strikers.
The repression has taken place
on two fronts: on the campus and
in the courts.
Ilayakawa
On the campus, Hayakawa has
subjected the new School of Third
World Studies to incredible
administrative restrictions, which
have resulted in qualified teachers
chosen by third world students,
faculty and community groups
being denied teaching positions
because of their participation in
the strike; in an emasculated
curriculum due to the refusal of
the administration to provide
financial resources for the
program; in the systematic
exclusion of third world students
from the college under the Equal
Opportunities Program; and in the
refusal of Hayakawa and the

Attorney General to release the
student funds which the Third
World Liberation Front
community action programs need
for their survival.
In the courts, the repression has
been ever heavier. Strikers are
being sentenced to six months in
jail for their participation in the
rally on the campus last January
23rd that resulted in a mass bust
of over 435 people. The judges
and the D.A.'s have fully
cooperated in the effort to ensure
that the juries cannot decide on
the facts of the case, but rather on
their fears of "student violence"
and "campus disruption." With
135 individual trials still pending,
including most of the felonies and
all the trials of the Third World
Liberation Front leadership, we
can expect that the political
repression in the courts will
increase.
The State strikers are certainly
not an isolated case of political
repression. We all know that the
U.S. government is engaged in a
systematic attempt to exterminate
the entire Black Panther Party;
and that the present conspiracy
trials in Chicago mark a big jump
in the repression of the anti-war
movement.
Exposure
We of the S.F. State Legal
Defense Committee believe that it
is time for the movement to
address itself to an understanding
and an exposure of the nature and
function of the judicial system:
who laws are made to protect,

how the enforcement of laws is
used to repress the forces
struggling for political change,
and, most important, how to
begin to fight—inside and outside
the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its
entirety, because we feel that it is
vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.
Power to the people,

[Below are reprinted exerpts
from a recent article by Sharon
Gold which appeared in the DOCK
OF THE BAY,local radical weekly.
At 12 noon, on January 23,
1969, a thousand strikers and
strike supporters gathered at a
rally in the middle of San
Francisco State's campus. The
rally lasted only 25 minutes when
the police surrounded and busted
435 of us, charging us with three
misdemeanors: disturbing the

peace, failure to dispense, and
unlawful assembly.
So far, 20 groups—l 67
people—have gone to trial. Of
these people, accused of the same
charges for the same act, with
identical evidence brought against
them:
42 have been acquitted of
all 3 charges;
35 received mixed hung juries
and acquittals, some have been
retried, others had charges
dropped;
31 were convicted of one or
two charges;
66 were convicted of all 3
charges.
The usual cost of an appeal
bond in a misdemeanor cast is
twice the amount of the original
bail. Bail was set for most of the
mass bust arrestees at $350 per
person. But the judges are setting
the majority of appeal bonds at
anywhere from $1500 to $6250,
in an attempt to intimidate us
from appealing the convictions.
Political Trials
As the Movement increases in
strength, the State steps up its use
of the courts as a major tool of
repression. "Impartial" trials are a
fantasy as more and more
decisions are handed down for
political reasons.
Broadly defined, all criminal
trials of poor people, third world
people and youth can be called
political trials for two main
reasons. First, because these
groups of people are the most
severely exploited by the political
and economic institutions of a
capitalist society. Second, the
decision to prosecute some crimes
and dismiss others is a political
decision.
A political trial is one in which
an individual or group is selected
for criminal prosecution for
actions that stem out of their
political beliefs. Categorizing the
charges as misdemeanor or felony
is incidental to the political
action.
The major differences between
the two kinds of charges is that
the jail penalty on a felony is
much higher than on a
misdemeanor, and that factual
evidence in a felony case tends to
have more relevance to the
outcome of the trial than in a
misdemeanor case.
No Juries of our Peers
For each group trial, about 125
prospective jurors are questioned.
Of these, approximately 8 are
black, one a student, one a young
worker under 25. Our juries are
overwhelmingly white and over
35.
Why can't we get tried by juries
of our peers—third world people,
poor people and youth? First,
because jury lists are selected
from registered voters, and most
of our peers can't affprd to live on
the $6 or $7 a day the city pays
for jury duty, and few employers
will compensate their workers
adequately for performing their
"civic duty." Third, because the
D.A. excludes anyone from sitting
on the jury who might have the
vaguest concern about educational
problems, or the oppression of
third world people.
The list of organizations,

membership in which disqualifies
a juror, according to the D.A.
includes SANE, American Friends
Service Committee, and the
NAACP, as well, of course, as the
strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the
strikers. The assembly wasn't
unlawful because Hayakawa's
edict banning rallies was simply
administrative fiat, not legislative
act. Nobody's peace was
disturbed; nobody filed a
complaint against the strikers for
making Loo much noise. Even thy
D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical
Education and History
departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.

[Below are reprinted exerpts
from a recent article by Sharon
Gold which appeared in the DOCK
OF THE BAY,local radical weekly.
At 12 noon, on January 23,
1969, a thousand strikers and
strike supporters gathered at a
rally in the middle of San
Francisco State's campus. The
rally lasted only 25 minutes when
the police surrounded and busted
435 of us, charging us with three
misdemeanors: disturbing the

peace, failure to dispense, and
unlawful assembly.
So far, 20 groups—l 67
people—have gone to trial. Of
these people, accused of the same
charges for the same act, with
identical evidence brought against
them:
42 have been acquitted of
all 3 charges;
35 received mixed hung juries
and acquittals, some have been
retried, others had charges
dropped;
31 were convicted of one or
two charges;
66 were convicted of all 3
charges.
The usual cost of an appeal
bond in a misdemeanor cast is
twice the amount of the original
bail. Bail was set for most of the
mass bust arrestees at $350 per
person. But the judges are setting
the majority of appeal bonds at
anywhere from $1500 to $6250,
in an attempt to intimidate us
from appealing the convictions.
Political Trials
As the Movement increases in
strength, the State steps up its use
of the courts as a major tool of
repression. "Impartial" trials are a
fantasy as more and more
decisions are handed down for
political reasons.
Broadly defined, all criminal
trials of poor people, third world
people and youth can be called
political trials for two main
reasons. First, because these
groups of people are the most
severely exploited by the political
and economic institutions of a
capitalist society. Second, the
decision to prosecute some crimes
and dismiss others is a political
decision.
A political trial is one in which
an individual or group is selected
for criminal prosecution for
actions that stem out of their
political beliefs. Categorizing the
charges as misdemeanor or felony
is incidental to the political
action.
The major differences between
the two kinds of charges is that
the jail penalty on a felony is
much higher than on a
misdemeanor, and that factual
evidence in a felony case tends to
have more relevance to the
outcome of the trial than in a
misdemeanor case.
No Juries of our Peers
For each group trial, about 125
prospective jurors are questioned.
Of these, approximately 8 are
black, one a student, one a young
worker under 25. Our juries are
overwhelmingly white and over
35.
Why can't we get tried by juries
of our peers—third world people,
poor people and youth? First,
because jury lists are selected
from registered voters, and most
of our peers can't affprd to live on
the $6 or $7 a day the city pays
for jury duty, and few employers
will compensate their workers
adequately for performing their
"civic duty." Third, because the
D.A. excludes anyone from sitting
on the jury who might have the
vaguest concern about educational
problems, or the oppression of
third world people.
The list of organizations,

membership in which disqualifies
a juror, according to the D.A.
includes SANE, American Friends
Service Committee, and the
NAACP, as well, of course, as the
strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the
strikers. The assembly wasn't
unlawful because Hayakawa's
edict banning rallies was simply
administrative fiat, not legislative
act. Nobody's peace was
disturbed; nobody filed a
complaint against the strikers for
making Loo much noise. Even thy
D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical
Education and History
departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.
Repression from the Bench
The San Francisco judges have
played a key role in the State's
repression of the strike. Two
weeks after the strike broke out
last November, the judges got
together and decided that no
people arrested at State would be
released on their own
recognizance.
During the mass bust, Judge
Mana unilaterally decided that
none of the 435 would get out on
OR. The result: we had to pay a
total of $70,000 in bail for our
700 brothers and sisters arrested
during the course of the
4 1 /2-month-long strike. Very
profitable for the insurance
companies who get the lion's
share of the bondsman's cut.
According to a Chronicle
editorial of Feb. 6, 1969, all the
judges were called to Sacramento
by East Bay legislator Don
Mulford, to discuss the State
trials. The judges were warned
that their political careers were in
jeopardy if they didn't make sure
that the trials resulted in
convictions and heavy sentences.
During the course of the State
trials, Judges Mana, Merrill and
Calcagno—none of whom have
acquired a reputation for leniency
toward the strikers—have been
promoted to Superior Court
judgeships. A job well done.
The judges find it hard to
restrain their prejudice against the
strikers. Judge Reynolds
introduced his close friend, the
daddy of the D.A., to the jury in
the middle of the trial. Judge
Eyman told the jury that campus

disorders were caused by faculty
who use their position to reach
students disloyalty to American
institutions.
Our Defense
Our defense is on two fronts:
against the charges, and against
the whole court system. Our
strategy to combat the charges
aims at building a political defense
which uses all available means
within the courtroom procedure
to educate the jury about the
politics of the strike, while at the
same time striving to win our
cases so that people don't have to
spend six months in jail for the
crime of attending a rallv.
Up to now, our main emphasis
of defense against the court
system has been the political
education of our lawyers. Because
we have no money to pay lawyers,
we've had to rely almost entirely
on the public defender's office,
and on young lawyers from large
firms who have been designated
by their senior partners to use the
State cases to get some "trial
experience."
The political education of the
lawyers happens in three ways:
First, the defendants educate
them about the politics of the
strike, so they know why we're on
trial.
Second, we try to establish a
new kind of relationship between
lawyers and defendants. The
defendants and the S.F. State
Legal Defense Committee assist
the lawyers at all stages of
preparation for the trials. In
exchange, the lawyers have to
agree that all decisions on trial
strategy will be made mutually by
lawyers and defendants.
Third, the actions of the D.A.'s
and the judges educate the
lawyers about what goes on in a
political trial. Our lawyers have
rapidly lost all illusions they may
have had about the impartiality of
the judicial system.
The court system is the most
powerfully entrenched and
legitimatized institution of
repression in American society.
Movement people on trial cannot
win against the courts in isolation.
Inside the courtroom, we need
to show the lawyers and the jurors
that we are on trial for our
politics, not for our "criminal"
activity. Outside the courtroom,
we need to begin to educate
millions of people about the real
nature of the court system.
Until our courts are controlled
by the people, there will be no
justice for the people.

San Francisco Slate Legal Defense
Committee appealing for greater
awareness of the continuing trials of
those arrested during the San Francisco
State strikes—Ed. |
Dear brothers and sisters:
Last year the strike at San
Francisco State made headlines in
the mass, college and movement
media for over 4 months. As you
well know, the demands that were
raised by the Third World
Liberation Front have had
national significance, both for the
student movement and for third
world groups around the country.
However, when the strike was
over, little attention was paid to
the aftermath of the strike—the
political repression of the strikers.
The repression has taken place
on two fronts: on the campus and
in the courts.
Ilayakawa
On the campus, Hayakawa has
subjected the new School of Third
World Studies to incredible
administrative restrictions, which
have resulted in qualified teachers
chosen by third world students,
faculty and community groups
being denied teaching positions
because of their participation in
the strike; in an emasculated
curriculum due to the refusal of
the administration to provide
financial resources for the
program; in the systematic
exclusion of third world students
from the college under the Equal
Opportunities Program; and in the
refusal of Hayakawa and the

Attorney General to release the
student funds which the Third
World Liberation Front
community action programs need
for their survival.
In the courts, the repression has
been ever heavier. Strikers are
being sentenced to six months in
jail for their participation in the
rally on the campus last January
23rd that resulted in a mass bust
of over 435 people. The judges
and the D.A.'s have fully
cooperated in the effort to ensure
that the juries cannot decide on
the facts of the case, but rather on
their fears of "student violence"
and "campus disruption." With
135 individual trials still pending,
including most of the felonies and
all the trials of the Third World
Liberation Front leadership, we
can expect that the political
repression in the courts will
increase.
The State strikers are certainly
not an isolated case of political
repression. We all know that the
U.S. government is engaged in a
systematic attempt to exterminate
the entire Black Panther Party;
and that the present conspiracy
trials in Chicago mark a big jump
in the repression of the anti-war
movement.
Exposure
We of the S.F. State Legal
Defense Committee believe that it
is time for the movement to
address itself to an understanding
and an exposure of the nature and
function of the judicial system:
who laws are made to protect,

how the enforcement of laws is
used to repress the forces
struggling for political change,
and, most important, how to
begin to fight—inside and outside
the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its
entirety, because we feel that it is
vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.

San Francisco Slate Legal Defense
Committee appealing for greater
awareness of the continuing trials of
those arrested during the San Francisco
State strikes—Ed. |
Dear brothers and sisters:
Last year the strike at San
Francisco State made headlines in
the mass, college and movement
media for over 4 months. As you
well know, the demands that were
raised by the Third World
Liberation Front have had
national significance, both for the
student movement and for third
world groups around the country.
However, when the strike was
over, little attention was paid to
the aftermath of the strike—the
political repression of the strikers.
The repression has taken place
on two fronts: on the campus and
in the courts.
Ilayakawa
On the campus, Hayakawa has
subjected the new School of Third
World Studies to incredible
administrative restrictions, which
have resulted in qualified teachers
chosen by third world students,
faculty and community groups
being denied teaching positions
because of their participation in
the strike; in an emasculated
curriculum due to the refusal of
the administration to provide
financial resources for the
program; in the systematic
exclusion of third world students
from the college under the Equal
Opportunities Program; and in the
refusal of Hayakawa and the

Attorney General to release the
student funds which the Third
World Liberation Front
community action programs need
for their survival.
In the courts, the repression has
been ever heavier. Strikers are
being sentenced to six months in
jail for their participation in the
rally on the campus last January
23rd that resulted in a mass bust
of over 435 people. The judges
and the D.A.'s have fully
cooperated in the effort to ensure
that the juries cannot decide on
the facts of the case, but rather on
their fears of "student violence"
and "campus disruption." With
135 individual trials still pending,
including most of the felonies and
all the trials of the Third World
Liberation Front leadership, we
can expect that the political
repression in the courts will
increase.
The State strikers are certainly
not an isolated case of political
repression. We all know that the
U.S. government is engaged in a
systematic attempt to exterminate
the entire Black Panther Party;
and that the present conspiracy
trials in Chicago mark a big jump
in the repression of the anti-war
movement.
Exposure
We of the S.F. State Legal
Defense Committee believe that it
is time for the movement to
address itself to an understanding
and an exposure of the nature and
function of the judicial system:
who laws are made to protect,

how the enforcement of laws is
used to repress the forces
struggling for political change,
and, most important, how to
begin to fight—inside and outside
the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its
entirety, because we feel that it is
vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.
Power to the people,

[Below are reprinted exerpts
from a recent article by Sharon
Gold which appeared in the DOCK
OF THE BAY,local radical weekly.
At 12 noon, on January 23,
1969, a thousand strikers and
strike supporters gathered at a
rally in the middle of San
Francisco State's campus. The
rally lasted only 25 minutes when
the police surrounded and busted
435 of us, charging us with three
misdemeanors: disturbing the

peace, failure to dispense, and
unlawful assembly.
So far, 20 groups—l 67
people—have gone to trial. Of
these people, accused of the same
charges for the same act, with
identical evidence brought against
them:
42 have been acquitted of
all 3 charges;
35 received mixed hung juries
and acquittals, some have been
retried, others had charges
dropped;
31 were convicted of one or
two charges;
66 were convicted of all 3
charges.
The usual cost of an appeal
bond in a misdemeanor cast is
twice the amount of the original
bail. Bail was set for most of the
mass bust arrestees at $350 per
person. But the judges are setting
the majority of appeal bonds at
anywhere from $1500 to $6250,
in an attempt to intimidate us
from appealing the convictions.
Political Trials
As the Movement increases in
strength, the State steps up its use
of the courts as a major tool of
repression. "Impartial" trials are a
fantasy as more and more
decisions are handed down for
political reasons.
Broadly defined, all criminal
trials of poor people, third world
people and youth can be called
political trials for two main
reasons. First, because these
groups of people are the most
severely exploited by the political
and economic institutions of a
capitalist society. Second, the
decision to prosecute some crimes
and dismiss others is a political
decision.
A political trial is one in which
an individual or group is selected
for criminal prosecution for
actions that stem out of their
political beliefs. Categorizing the
charges as misdemeanor or felony
is incidental to the political
action.
The major differences between
the two kinds of charges is that
the jail penalty on a felony is
much higher than on a
misdemeanor, and that factual
evidence in a felony case tends to
have more relevance to the
outcome of the trial than in a
misdemeanor case.
No Juries of our Peers
For each group trial, about 125
prospective jurors are questioned.
Of these, approximately 8 are
black, one a student, one a young
worker under 25. Our juries are
overwhelmingly white and over
35.
Why can't we get tried by juries
of our peers—third world people,
poor people and youth? First,
because jury lists are selected
from registered voters, and most
of our peers can't affprd to live on
the $6 or $7 a day the city pays
for jury duty, and few employers
will compensate their workers
adequately for performing their
"civic duty." Third, because the
D.A. excludes anyone from sitting
on the jury who might have the
vaguest concern about educational
problems, or the oppression of
third world people.
The list of organizations,

membership in which disqualifies
a juror, according to the D.A.
includes SANE, American Friends
Service Committee, and the
NAACP, as well, of course, as the
strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the
strikers. The assembly wasn't
unlawful because Hayakawa's
edict banning rallies was simply
administrative fiat, not legislative
act. Nobody's peace was
disturbed; nobody filed a
complaint against the strikers for
making Loo much noise. Even thy
D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical
Education and History
departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.
Repression from the Bench
The San Francisco judges have
played a key role in the State's
repression of the strike. Two
weeks after the strike broke out
last November, the judges got
together and decided that no
people arrested at State would be
released on their own
recognizance.
During the mass bust, Judge
Mana unilaterally decided that
none of the 435 would get out on
OR. The result: we had to pay a
total of $70,000 in bail for our
700 brothers and sisters arrested
during the course of the
4 1 /2-month-long strike. Very
profitable for the insurance
companies who get the lion's
share of the bondsman's cut.
According to a Chronicle
editorial of Feb. 6, 1969, all the
judges were called to Sacramento
by East Bay legislator Don
Mulford, to discuss the State
trials. The judges were warned
that their political careers were in
jeopardy if they didn't make sure
that the trials resulted in
convictions and heavy sentences.
During the course of the State
trials, Judges Mana, Merrill and
Calcagno—none of whom have
acquired a reputation for leniency
toward the strikers—have been
promoted to Superior Court
judgeships. A job well done.
The judges find it hard to
restrain their prejudice against the
strikers. Judge Reynolds
introduced his close friend, the
daddy of the D.A., to the jury in
the middle of the trial. Judge
Eyman told the jury that campus

disorders were caused by faculty
who use their position to reach
students disloyalty to American
institutions.
Our Defense
Our defense is on two fronts:
against the charges, and against
the whole court system. Our
strategy to combat the charges
aims at building a political defense
which uses all available means
within the courtroom procedure
to educate the jury about the
politics of the strike, while at the
same time striving to win our
cases so that people don't have to
spend six months in jail for the
crime of attending a rallv.
Up to now, our main emphasis
of defense against the court
system has been the political
education of our lawyers. Because
we have no money to pay lawyers,
we've had to rely almost entirely
on the public defender's office,
and on young lawyers from large
firms who have been designated
by their senior partners to use the
State cases to get some "trial
experience."
The political education of the
lawyers happens in three ways:
First, the defendants educate
them about the politics of the
strike, so they know why we're on
trial.
Second, we try to establish a
new kind of relationship between
lawyers and defendants. The
defendants and the S.F. State
Legal Defense Committee assist
the lawyers at all stages of
preparation for the trials. In
exchange, the lawyers have to
agree that all decisions on trial
strategy will be made mutually by
lawyers and defendants.
Third, the actions of the D.A.'s
and the judges educate the
lawyers about what goes on in a
political trial. Our lawyers have
rapidly lost all illusions they may
have had about the impartiality of
the judicial system.
The court system is the most
powerfully entrenched and
legitimatized institution of
repression in American society.
Movement people on trial cannot
win against the courts in isolation.

strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the
strikers. The assembly wasn't
unlawful because Hayakawa's
edict banning rallies was simply
administrative fiat, not legislative
act. Nobody's peace was
disturbed; nobody filed a
complaint against the strikers for
making Loo much noise. Even thy
D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical
Education and History
departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.
Repression from the Bench
The San Francisco judges have
played a key role in the State's
repression of the strike. Two
weeks after the strike broke out
last November, the judges got
together and decided that no
people arrested at State would be
released on their own
recognizance.
During the mass bust, Judge
Mana unilaterally decided that
none of the 435 would get out on
OR. The result: we had to pay a
total of $70,000 in bail for our
700 brothers and sisters arrested
during the course of the
4 1 /2-month-long strike. Very
profitable for the insurance
companies who get the lion's
share of the bondsman's cut.
According to a Chronicle
editorial of Feb. 6, 1969, all the
judges were called to Sacramento
by East Bay legislator Don
Mulford, to discuss the State
trials. The judges were warned
that their political careers were in
jeopardy if they didn't make sure
that the trials resulted in
convictions and heavy sentences.
During the course of the State
trials, Judges Mana, Merrill and
Calcagno—none of whom have
acquired a reputation for leniency
toward the strikers—have been
promoted to Superior Court
judgeships. A job well done.
The judges find it hard to
restrain their prejudice against the
strikers. Judge Reynolds
introduced his close friend, the
daddy of the D.A., to the jury in
the middle of the trial. Judge
Eyman told the jury that campus

disorders were caused by faculty
who use their position to reach
students disloyalty to American
institutions.
Our Defense
Our defense is on two fronts:
against the charges, and against
the whole court system. Our
strategy to combat the charges
aims at building a political defense
which uses all available means
within the courtroom procedure
to educate the jury about the
politics of the strike, while at the
same time striving to win our
cases so that people don't have to
spend six months in jail for the
crime of attending a rallv.
Up to now, our main emphasis
of defense against the court
system has been the political
education of our lawyers. Because
we have no money to pay lawyers,
we've had to rely almost entirely
on the public defender's office,
and on young lawyers from large
firms who have been designated
by their senior partners to use the
State cases to get some "trial
experience."
The political education of the
lawyers happens in three ways:
First, the defendants educate
them about the politics of the
strike, so they know why we're on
trial.
Second, we try to establish a
new kind of relationship between
lawyers and defendants. The
defendants and the S.F. State
Legal Defense Committee assist
the lawyers at all stages of
preparation for the trials. In
exchange, the lawyers have to
agree that all decisions on trial
strategy will be made mutually by
lawyers and defendants.
Third, the actions of the D.A.'s
and the judges educate the
lawyers about what goes on in a
political trial. Our lawyers have
rapidly lost all illusions they may
have had about the impartiality of
the judicial system.
The court system is the most
powerfully entrenched and
legitimatized institution of
repression in American society.
Movement people on trial cannot
win against the courts in isolation.
Inside the courtroom, we need
to show the lawyers and the jurors
that we are on trial for our
politics, not for our "criminal"
activity. Outside the courtroom,
we need to begin to educate
millions of people about the real
nature of the court system.
Until our courts are controlled
by the people, there will be no
justice for the people.

Committee appealing for greater
awareness of the continuing trials of
those arrested during the San Francisco
State strikes—Ed. |
Dear brothers and sisters:
Last year the strike at San
Francisco State made headlines in
the mass, college and movement
media for over 4 months. As you
well know, the demands that were
raised by the Third World
Liberation Front have had
national significance, both for the
student movement and for third
world groups around the country.
However, when the strike was
over, little attention was paid to
the aftermath of the strike—the
political repression of the strikers.
The repression has taken place
on two fronts: on the campus and
in the courts.
Ilayakawa
On the campus, Hayakawa has
subjected the new School of Third
World Studies to incredible
administrative restrictions, which
have resulted in qualified teachers
chosen by third world students,
faculty and community groups
being denied teaching positions
because of their participation in
the strike; in an emasculated
curriculum due to the refusal of
the administration to provide
financial resources for the
program; in the systematic
exclusion of third world students
from the college under the Equal
Opportunities Program; and in the
refusal of Hayakawa and the

Attorney General to release the
student funds which the Third
World Liberation Front
community action programs need
for their survival.
In the courts, the repression has
been ever heavier. Strikers are
being sentenced to six months in
jail for their participation in the
rally on the campus last January
23rd that resulted in a mass bust
of over 435 people. The judges
and the D.A.'s have fully
cooperated in the effort to ensure
that the juries cannot decide on
the facts of the case, but rather on
their fears of "student violence"
and "campus disruption." With
135 individual trials still pending,
including most of the felonies and
all the trials of the Third World
Liberation Front leadership, we
can expect that the political
repression in the courts will
increase.
The State strikers are certainly
not an isolated case of political
repression. We all know that the
U.S. government is engaged in a
systematic attempt to exterminate
the entire Black Panther Party;
and that the present conspiracy
trials in Chicago mark a big jump
in the repression of the anti-war
movement.
Exposure
We of the S.F. State Legal
Defense Committee believe that it
is time for the movement to
address itself to an understanding
and an exposure of the nature and
function of the judicial system:
who laws are made to protect,

how the enforcement of laws is
used to repress the forces
struggling for political change,
and, most important, how to
begin to fight—inside and outside
the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its
entirety, because we feel that it is
vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.
Power to the people,
San Francisco Slate
Legal I) efense Committee

[Below are reprinted exerpts
from a recent article by Sharon
Gold which appeared in the DOCK
OF THE BAY,local radical weekly.
At 12 noon, on January 23,
1969, a thousand strikers and
strike supporters gathered at a
rally in the middle of San
Francisco State's campus. The
rally lasted only 25 minutes when
the police surrounded and busted
435 of us, charging us with three
misdemeanors: disturbing the

peace, failure to dispense, and
unlawful assembly.
So far, 20 groups—l 67
people—have gone to trial. Of
these people, accused of the same
charges for the same act, with
identical evidence brought against
them:
42 have been acquitted of
all 3 charges;
35 received mixed hung juries
and acquittals, some have been
retried, others had charges
dropped;
31 were convicted of one or
two charges;
66 were convicted of all 3
charges.
The usual cost of an appeal
bond in a misdemeanor cast is
twice the amount of the original
bail. Bail was set for most of the
mass bust arrestees at $350 per
person. But the judges are setting
the majority of appeal bonds at
anywhere from $1500 to $6250,
in an attempt to intimidate us
from appealing the convictions.
Political Trials
As the Movement increases in
strength, the State steps up its use
of the courts as a major tool of
repression. "Impartial" trials are a
fantasy as more and more
decisions are handed down for
political reasons.
Broadly defined, all criminal
trials of poor people, third world
people and youth can be called
political trials for two main
reasons. First, because these
groups of people are the most
severely exploited by the political
and economic institutions of a
capitalist society. Second, the
decision to prosecute some crimes
and dismiss others is a political
decision.
A political trial is one in which
an individual or group is selected
for criminal prosecution for
actions that stem out of their
political beliefs. Categorizing the
charges as misdemeanor or felony
is incidental to the political
action.
The major differences between
the two kinds of charges is that
the jail penalty on a felony is
much higher than on a
misdemeanor, and that factual
evidence in a felony case tends to
have more relevance to the
outcome of the trial than in a
misdemeanor case.
No Juries of our Peers
For each group trial, about 125
prospective jurors are questioned.
Of these, approximately 8 are
black, one a student, one a young
worker under 25. Our juries are
overwhelmingly white and over
35.
Why can't we get tried by juries
of our peers—third world people,
poor people and youth? First,
because jury lists are selected
from registered voters, and most
of our peers can't affprd to live on
the $6 or $7 a day the city pays
for jury duty, and few employers
will compensate their workers
adequately for performing their
"civic duty." Third, because the
D.A. excludes anyone from sitting
on the jury who might have the
vaguest concern about educational
problems, or the oppression of
third world people.
The list of organizations,

membership in which disqualifies
a juror, according to the D.A.
includes SANE, American Friends
Service Committee, and the
NAACP, as well, of course, as the
strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the

administrative fiat, not legislative

the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its

vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.

[Below are reprinted exerpts
from a recent article by Sharon
Gold which appeared in the DOCK
OF THE BAY,local radical weekly.
At 12 noon, on January 23,
1969, a thousand strikers and
strike supporters gathered at a
rally in the middle of San
Francisco State's campus. The
rally lasted only 25 minutes when
the police surrounded and busted
435 of us, charging us with three
misdemeanors: disturbing the

peace, failure to dispense, and
unlawful assembly.
So far, 20 groups—l 67
people—have gone to trial. Of
these people, accused of the same
charges for the same act, with
identical evidence brought against
them:
42 have been acquitted of
all 3 charges;
35 received mixed hung juries
and acquittals, some have been
retried, others had charges
dropped;
31 were convicted of one or
two charges;
66 were convicted of all 3
charges.
The usual cost of an appeal
bond in a misdemeanor cast is
twice the amount of the original
bail. Bail was set for most of the
mass bust arrestees at $350 per
person. But the judges are setting
the majority of appeal bonds at
anywhere from $1500 to $6250,
in an attempt to intimidate us
from appealing the convictions.
Political Trials
As the Movement increases in
strength, the State steps up its use
of the courts as a major tool of
repression. "Impartial" trials are a
fantasy as more and more
decisions are handed down for
political reasons.
Broadly defined, all criminal
trials of poor people, third world
people and youth can be called
political trials for two main
reasons. First, because these
groups of people are the most
severely exploited by the political
and economic institutions of a
capitalist society. Second, the
decision to prosecute some crimes
and dismiss others is a political
decision.
A political trial is one in which
an individual or group is selected
for criminal prosecution for
actions that stem out of their
political beliefs. Categorizing the
charges as misdemeanor or felony
is incidental to the political
action.
The major differences between
the two kinds of charges is that
the jail penalty on a felony is
much higher than on a
misdemeanor, and that factual
evidence in a felony case tends to
have more relevance to the
outcome of the trial than in a
misdemeanor case.
No Juries of our Peers
For each group trial, about 125
prospective jurors are questioned.
Of these, approximately 8 are
black, one a student, one a young
worker under 25. Our juries are
overwhelmingly white and over
35.
Why can't we get tried by juries
of our peers—third world people,
poor people and youth? First,
because jury lists are selected
from registered voters, and most
of our peers can't affprd to live on
the $6 or $7 a day the city pays
for jury duty, and few employers
will compensate their workers
adequately for performing their
"civic duty." Third, because the
D.A. excludes anyone from sitting
on the jury who might have the
vaguest concern about educational
problems, or the oppression of
third world people.
The list of organizations,

membership in which disqualifies
a juror, according to the D.A.
includes SANE, American Friends
Service Committee, and the
NAACP, as well, of course, as the
strike-support organizations and
the Panthers. To balance the list,
the D.A. also includes the
American Independent Party, the
Minutemen, and the American
Nazi Party . . . The
Commonwealth Club made up of
the chief capitalists of San
Francisco who gave Hayakawa a
standing ovation, is not on the
list.
The D.A.'s Case
The D.A. has no evidence to
prove the 3 charges against the
strikers. The assembly wasn't
unlawful because Hayakawa's
edict banning rallies was simply
administrative fiat, not legislative
act. Nobody's peace was
disturbed; nobody filed a
complaint against the strikers for
making Loo much noise. Even thy
D.A.'s chief witnesses, faculty
from the Business, Physical
Education and History
departments, testified they kept
teaching their classes throughout
the rally. The strikers all testified
they couldn't hear the words of
the police order to disperse given
over the loud speaker; besides
which, they had nowhere to
disperse to, since the police had
them completely surrounded.
With absolutely no evidence to
back up the charges, the D.A.'s
resort to building their whole case
on the emotional appeal to the
jurors fears of violence—student
violence, not police violence.
Repression from the Bench
The San Francisco judges have
played a key role in the State's
repression of the strike. Two
weeks after the strike broke out
last November, the judges got
together and decided that no
people arrested at State would be
released on their own
recognizance.
During the mass bust, Judge
Mana unilaterally decided that
none of the 435 would get out on
OR. The result: we had to pay a
total of $70,000 in bail for our
700 brothers and sisters arrested
during the course of the
4 1 /2-month-long strike. Very
profitable for the insurance
companies who get the lion's
share of the bondsman's cut.
According to a Chronicle
editorial of Feb. 6, 1969, all the
judges were called to Sacramento
by East Bay legislator Don
Mulford, to discuss the State
trials. The judges were warned
that their political careers were in
jeopardy if they didn't make sure
that the trials resulted in
convictions and heavy sentences.
During the course of the State
trials, Judges Mana, Merrill and
Calcagno—none of whom have
acquired a reputation for leniency
toward the strikers—have been
promoted to Superior Court
judgeships. A job well done.
The judges find it hard to
restrain their prejudice against the
strikers. Judge Reynolds
introduced his close friend, the
daddy of the D.A., to the jury in
the middle of the trial. Judge
Eyman told the jury that campus

disorders were caused by faculty
who use their position to reach
students disloyalty to American
institutions.
Our Defense
Our defense is on two fronts:
against the charges, and against
the whole court system. Our
strategy to combat the charges
aims at building a political defense
which uses all available means
within the courtroom procedure
to educate the jury about the
politics of the strike, while at the
same time striving to win our
cases so that people don't have to
spend six months in jail for the
crime of attending a rallv.
Up to now, our main emphasis
of defense against the court
system has been the political
education of our lawyers. Because
we have no money to pay lawyers,
we've had to rely almost entirely
on the public defender's office,
and on young lawyers from large
firms who have been designated
by their senior partners to use the
State cases to get some "trial
experience."
The political education of the
lawyers happens in three ways:
First, the defendants educate
them about the politics of the
strike, so they know why we're on
trial.
Second, we try to establish a
new kind of relationship between
lawyers and defendants. The
defendants and the S.F. State
Legal Defense Committee assist
the lawyers at all stages of
preparation for the trials. In
exchange, the lawyers have to
agree that all decisions on trial
strategy will be made mutually by
lawyers and defendants.
Third, the actions of the D.A.'s
and the judges educate the
lawyers about what goes on in a
political trial. Our lawyers have
rapidly lost all illusions they may
have had about the impartiality of
the judicial system.
The court system is the most
powerfully entrenched and
legitimatized institution of
repression in American society.
Movement people on trial cannot
win against the courts in isolation.
Inside the courtroom, we need
to show the lawyers and the jurors
that we are on trial for our
politics, not for our "criminal"
activity. Outside the courtroom,
we need to begin to educate
millions of people about the real
nature of the court system.
Until our courts are controlled
by the people, there will be no
justice for the people.
| The following is a letter from the
San Francisco Slate Legal Defense
Committee appealing for greater
awareness of the continuing trials of
those arrested during the San Francisco
State strikes—Ed. |
Dear brothers and sisters:
Last year the strike at San
Francisco State made headlines in
the mass, college and movement
media for over 4 months. As you
well know, the demands that were
raised by the Third World
Liberation Front have had
national significance, both for the
student movement and for third
world groups around the country.
However, when the strike was
over, little attention was paid to
the aftermath of the strike—the
political repression of the strikers.
The repression has taken place
on two fronts: on the campus and
in the courts.
Ilayakawa
On the campus, Hayakawa has
subjected the new School of Third
World Studies to incredible
administrative restrictions, which
have resulted in qualified teachers
chosen by third world students,
faculty and community groups
being denied teaching positions
because of their participation in
the strike; in an emasculated
curriculum due to the refusal of
the administration to provide
financial resources for the
program; in the systematic
exclusion of third world students
from the college under the Equal
Opportunities Program; and in the
refusal of Hayakawa and the

Attorney General to release the
student funds which the Third
World Liberation Front
community action programs need
for their survival.
In the courts, the repression has
been ever heavier. Strikers are
being sentenced to six months in
jail for their participation in the
rally on the campus last January
23rd that resulted in a mass bust
of over 435 people. The judges
and the D.A.'s have fully
cooperated in the effort to ensure
that the juries cannot decide on
the facts of the case, but rather on
their fears of "student violence"
and "campus disruption." With
135 individual trials still pending,
including most of the felonies and
all the trials of the Third World
Liberation Front leadership, we
can expect that the political
repression in the courts will
increase.
The State strikers are certainly
not an isolated case of political
repression. We all know that the
U.S. government is engaged in a
systematic attempt to exterminate
the entire Black Panther Party;
and that the present conspiracy
trials in Chicago mark a big jump
in the repression of the anti-war
movement.
Exposure
We of the S.F. State Legal
Defense Committee believe that it
is time for the movement to
address itself to an understanding
and an exposure of the nature and
function of the judicial system:
who laws are made to protect,

how the enforcement of laws is
used to repress the forces
struggling for political change,
and, most important, how to
begin to fight—inside and outside
the courtroom—against this form
of political repression.
The following is a long article
that was printed in the Dock of
the Bay, Sept. 23, which lays
some groundwork for an
understanding of what a political
trial is all about. We hope that
you will reprint this article in its
entirety, because we feel that it is
vital for movement people and
their supporters to begin to
understand what is going on.
The struggle against
encroaching fascism in this
country has to be fought on many
fronts. If we don't begin that
struggle now, we will soon be
faced with a situation reminiscent
of Nazi Germany.
