## SDS Position Clarified 
### 
Leonard Siegal

(Leonard Siege I is a suspended
student in physics and active mem
ber of the local SDS chapter. He
at tempts here to present the dif
ferences in philosophy that sprung
up during the SDS summer con
vention.)
The Students for a Democratic
Society has been, for the past few
years, the largest organization of
the radical American Left. SDS,
which built itself through
opposition to the Vietnam War
and the draft, and by pressing for
student power and university
reform, emerged last year as a
serious socialist, revolutionary
organization, with concerns
beyond the college campuses on
which it developed. This
development was recognized by
the American ruling class, which
escalated its attack, both verbal
and "legal," on SDS.
It appears now, though, that
SDS is experiencing the
clumsiness of the teenage
movement that grew too fast. The
splits and sectarianism in SDS, as
well as rampant disregard of
reality in many sectors, have just
about destroyed SDS's
development as a national
organization. But the enemies of
SDS should not take heart. The
Movement is much bigger than
any set of initials or organization.
The splits in SDS which
crystallized this summer are not
simple, and are closely tied to the
development of the movement.
Stanford SDS, and the radical
movement at Stanford, has been
relatively free of the divisions
which have plagued the
organization elsewhere. I will
attempt here to characterize the
different positions in SDS. The
reader should be warned that the
divisions are not left vs right, in
the traditional sense, and that in
fact, most of the factions claim to
be the left-wing of SDS. PL-WSA
the Progressive Labor Party
considers itself a Marxist-Leninist
Party. It dominates the
Worker-Student Alliance caucus in
SDS. It contends, that the
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class. Racial oppression
and national subjugation,
according to the PL-WSA analysis,
are subordinates. Its strategy for
building a revolutionary
movement is summed up in "build
a worker-student alliance," using
the growing student movement as
cadre to organize amongst the
American working class.
Disciplined Cadre
For the past several years PL
has operated as a disciplined
external cadre within SDS, with
members making decisions in
caucuses. PL's emphasis on the
working class led to the
development of "working-class
politics" in most of SDS, but it
dogmatism has always been
resented. The last straw, for many
SDS members, came when PL put
forward its position on
revolutionary nationalism. PL's
theoretical magazine said "All
nationalism is reactionary." PL
denounced the National
Liberation Front of South
Vietnam for being an alliance of
nationalist forces without a
Communist program, and said
that NLF leadership was selling
out its people by negotiating in
Paris. PL condemned the Black
Panther Party for putting forward
concepts of black community
control. And, after supporting the
SF State Strike and similar
struggles for months, PL
condemned demands for open
admission for Blacks, and for
Black studies. Such demands,
according to PL, are reverse racist
and nationalist. And in Berkeley,

PL opposed the People's Park
struggle, although it actively
opposed the military invasion of
Berkeley. Such positions are an
extreme extension of PL's
interpretation of building a
worker-student alliance. PL
opposes activities which it thinks
will turn off large numbers of
White workers.
Convention in Chicago this
summer, the WSA caucus
composed the largest bloc of
voting delegates. PL had chartered
planes (!) to bring its people to
Chicago. Factional anger grew to
the point at which the formal
national leaders of SDS led a
walk-out. At the assembly of the
delegates who left, a vote was
taken to "expel" PL and WSA
which do compose a minority in
SDS, but were well-represented at
the convention. The walk-out
group maintained control of the
national SDS office and facilities
in Chicago, so a shadow SDS
office was set up by WSA and a
few allies in Boston. Both groups
claim to be the real SDS.
WEATHERMAN Early this
summer a paper entitled "You
Don't Need a Weatherman to
Know Which Way the Wind
Blows" was circulated within
SDS. This paper, which drew a lot
of support, posited that "The
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
oppressed nation and the
oppressor nation." America's
internal colonies are considered
nations. The "revolutionary"
strategy which has evolved
considers students and white
workers adjuncts of black and
Third World revolutionary
movements, with the prime task
of supporting the blacks and
Third World liberation
movements. Weatherman expects
an American revolution soon, it
appears, for it has abandoned
most of its mass organizing. What
organizing it does do, is based
around the American tradition of
violence. Weatherman rejects
programs which purport to "serve
the people" as reformist, although
these programs often fit into a
revolutionary strategy.
Politics and Actions
Strangely enough,
Weatherman's politics and actions
(such as running through high
school shouting "Jailbreak!") has
drawn criticism from all sectors of
the left, including the black
organizations whose leadership
they claim to expect to follow in
an imminent revolution.
Weatherman spokesmen have
recently begun to rest on
dogmatism and sectarianism.
Everyone in SDS who criticizes
"the correct politics of
Weatherman" is labeled a
"running dog."
At the National Convention
members of Weatherman
collectives were elected as
National Officers of the group
that walked out. The officers have
since disowned any responsibility
to the membership of SDS. Their
responsibility is to the "Weather
Bureau"—the Weatherman
collectives.
RYM 11 The Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (Weatherman was
originally known as RYM I) was
the third largest group at the
National Convention. Unlike
PL-WSA and Weatherman, RYM
II enjoys some popularity
amongst the Stanford chapter,
primarily from members of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union.
RYM II combines some of the
major ideological elements of the
former two factions.
II views imperialism as the
"major contradiction today," but
unlike Weatherman, it does not
conceive of revolution without
working class leadership—black
and white. The RYM II strategy
of "United Front Against

Imperialism" means that the
Movement should do mass work
with whity workers, to tie their
struggles to the struggles of their
class allies, the American blacks
and the Vietnamese. The
Richmond Oil Strike best
exemplifies this strategy. The
supposedly "racist" oil and
chemical workers by a 2 to 1
margin endorsed the Third World
strikes at San Francisco State and
Berkeley, for they learned that
the same people were fighting the
same enemy in Richmond and on
the campuses. In fact, the union
sent official delegations to walk
the campus strike picket lines.
No Legitimacy
RYM II believes that a
revolutionary movement has no
legitimacy, and cannot succeed,
unless it "serves the people." In
other words, the movement must
offer programs which will meet
the needs of oppressed people,
and relate those needs to a
long-range strategy.
RYM II is perhaps the closest
adherent of traditional
Marxism-Leninism within SDS.
RYM II feels centralism is
necessary for a revolutionary
movement, but wants to avoid the
development of a bureaucratic
authoritarian state (Russia). RYM
II sees the Chinese cultural
revolution as a model for
returning power to the people.
New Left The strength of the
preceeding three factions at the
National Convention rests
primarily on the importance, as
they see it, of dominating a
national organization. Perhaps the
largest group in SDS (easily such
at Stanford), un-organized and
without any clear written
statement of principles, grows out
of the New Left tradition which
has considered local activity the
basis of SDS. This tradition
de-emphasizes structured theory,
and is relatively new. However,
"New Leftists" like myself are
beginning to understand the
necessity of putting forward
coherent theoretical politics, and
may soon begin to do so.
RYM II urges the formation of
disciplined collectives, and
believes that a revolutionary
movement should be structured
around "democratic centralism,"
which means that the
organizational (party)
membership is subordinate to an
elected central committee. The
New Leftists, on the other hand,
believe in participatory
democracy and representative
democracy, with less stress on
discipline. When possible,
according to this philosophy,
people should be able to
participate in the decisions which
affect them. When not, their
representatives should attempt to
represent their views. The New
Left position often allows for
individual rejection of collective
decisions.
* * *
The results of the splits in SDS
are unclear. Stanford SDS is
unaffected by the nationwide
divisions. The Stanford chapter is
now participating in a Northern
California SDS Regional
Organization, made up of RYM 11,
New Left, and "uncommitted"
sentiments. Personally, I expect
this Northern California Region to
build a new multi-tendency mass
organization. Regardless, at this
point SDS nationally has little
meaning to the large Bay Area
movement.
In this article I have not
explained the deep analysis which
has convinced most SDS'ers to
become revolutionaries.lt would
be impossible to accurately
represent the thought behind
these conclusions here. Rather, I
suggest that people participate in
SDS programs and projects this
year.

SF State Strike and similar
struggles for months, PL
condemned demands for open
admission for Blacks, and for
Black studies. Such demands,
according to PL, are reverse racist
and nationalist. And in Berkeley,

PL opposed the People's Park
struggle, although it actively
opposed the military invasion of
Berkeley. Such positions are an
extreme extension of PL's
interpretation of building a
worker-student alliance. PL
opposes activities which it thinks
will turn off large numbers of
White workers.
Convention in Chicago this
summer, the WSA caucus
composed the largest bloc of
voting delegates. PL had chartered
planes (!) to bring its people to
Chicago. Factional anger grew to
the point at which the formal
national leaders of SDS led a
walk-out. At the assembly of the
delegates who left, a vote was
taken to "expel" PL and WSA
which do compose a minority in
SDS, but were well-represented at
the convention. The walk-out
group maintained control of the
national SDS office and facilities
in Chicago, so a shadow SDS
office was set up by WSA and a
few allies in Boston. Both groups
claim to be the real SDS.
WEATHERMAN Early this
summer a paper entitled "You
Don't Need a Weatherman to
Know Which Way the Wind
Blows" was circulated within
SDS. This paper, which drew a lot
of support, posited that "The
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
oppressed nation and the
oppressor nation." America's
internal colonies are considered
nations. The "revolutionary"
strategy which has evolved
considers students and white
workers adjuncts of black and
Third World revolutionary
movements, with the prime task
of supporting the blacks and
Third World liberation
movements. Weatherman expects
an American revolution soon, it
appears, for it has abandoned
most of its mass organizing. What
organizing it does do, is based
around the American tradition of
violence. Weatherman rejects
programs which purport to "serve
the people" as reformist, although
these programs often fit into a
revolutionary strategy.
Politics and Actions
Strangely enough,
Weatherman's politics and actions
(such as running through high
school shouting "Jailbreak!") has
drawn criticism from all sectors of
the left, including the black
organizations whose leadership
they claim to expect to follow in
an imminent revolution.
Weatherman spokesmen have
recently begun to rest on
dogmatism and sectarianism.
Everyone in SDS who criticizes
"the correct politics of
Weatherman" is labeled a
"running dog."
At the National Convention
members of Weatherman
collectives were elected as
National Officers of the group
that walked out. The officers have
since disowned any responsibility
to the membership of SDS. Their
responsibility is to the "Weather
Bureau"—the Weatherman
collectives.
RYM 11 The Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (Weatherman was
originally known as RYM I) was
the third largest group at the
National Convention. Unlike
PL-WSA and Weatherman, RYM
II enjoys some popularity
amongst the Stanford chapter,
primarily from members of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union.
RYM II combines some of the
major ideological elements of the
former two factions.
II views imperialism as the
"major contradiction today," but
unlike Weatherman, it does not
conceive of revolution without
working class leadership—black
and white. The RYM II strategy
of "United Front Against

Imperialism" means that the
Movement should do mass work
with whity workers, to tie their
struggles to the struggles of their
class allies, the American blacks
and the Vietnamese. The
Richmond Oil Strike best
exemplifies this strategy. The
supposedly "racist" oil and
chemical workers by a 2 to 1
margin endorsed the Third World
strikes at San Francisco State and
Berkeley, for they learned that
the same people were fighting the
same enemy in Richmond and on
the campuses. In fact, the union
sent official delegations to walk
the campus strike picket lines.
No Legitimacy
RYM II believes that a
revolutionary movement has no
legitimacy, and cannot succeed,
unless it "serves the people." In
other words, the movement must
offer programs which will meet
the needs of oppressed people,
and relate those needs to a
long-range strategy.
RYM II is perhaps the closest
adherent of traditional
Marxism-Leninism within SDS.
RYM II feels centralism is
necessary for a revolutionary
movement, but wants to avoid the
development of a bureaucratic
authoritarian state (Russia). RYM
II sees the Chinese cultural
revolution as a model for
returning power to the people.
New Left The strength of the
preceeding three factions at the
National Convention rests
primarily on the importance, as
they see it, of dominating a
national organization. Perhaps the
largest group in SDS (easily such
at Stanford), un-organized and
without any clear written
statement of principles, grows out
of the New Left tradition which
has considered local activity the
basis of SDS. This tradition
de-emphasizes structured theory,
and is relatively new. However,
"New Leftists" like myself are
beginning to understand the
necessity of putting forward
coherent theoretical politics, and
may soon begin to do so.
RYM II urges the formation of
disciplined collectives, and
believes that a revolutionary
movement should be structured
around "democratic centralism,"
which means that the
organizational (party)
membership is subordinate to an
elected central committee. The
New Leftists, on the other hand,
believe in participatory
democracy and representative
democracy, with less stress on
discipline. When possible,
according to this philosophy,
people should be able to
participate in the decisions which
affect them. When not, their
representatives should attempt to
represent their views. The New
Left position often allows for
individual rejection of collective
decisions.
* * *
The results of the splits in SDS
are unclear. Stanford SDS is
unaffected by the nationwide
divisions. The Stanford chapter is
now participating in a Northern
California SDS Regional
Organization, made up of RYM 11,
New Left, and "uncommitted"
sentiments. Personally, I expect
this Northern California Region to
build a new multi-tendency mass
organization. Regardless, at this
point SDS nationally has little
meaning to the large Bay Area
movement.
In this article I have not
explained the deep analysis which
has convinced most SDS'ers to
become revolutionaries.lt would
be impossible to accurately
represent the thought behind
these conclusions here. Rather, I
suggest that people participate in
SDS programs and projects this
year.
Leonard Siegal

(Leonard Siege I is a suspended
student in physics and active mem
ber of the local SDS chapter. He
at tempts here to present the dif
ferences in philosophy that sprung
up during the SDS summer con
vention.)
The Students for a Democratic
Society has been, for the past few
years, the largest organization of
the radical American Left. SDS,
which built itself through
opposition to the Vietnam War
and the draft, and by pressing for
student power and university
reform, emerged last year as a
serious socialist, revolutionary
organization, with concerns
beyond the college campuses on
which it developed. This
development was recognized by
the American ruling class, which
escalated its attack, both verbal
and "legal," on SDS.
It appears now, though, that
SDS is experiencing the
clumsiness of the teenage
movement that grew too fast. The
splits and sectarianism in SDS, as
well as rampant disregard of
reality in many sectors, have just
about destroyed SDS's
development as a national
organization. But the enemies of
SDS should not take heart. The
Movement is much bigger than
any set of initials or organization.
The splits in SDS which
crystallized this summer are not
simple, and are closely tied to the
development of the movement.
Stanford SDS, and the radical
movement at Stanford, has been
relatively free of the divisions
which have plagued the
organization elsewhere. I will
attempt here to characterize the
different positions in SDS. The
reader should be warned that the
divisions are not left vs right, in
the traditional sense, and that in
fact, most of the factions claim to
be the left-wing of SDS. PL-WSA
the Progressive Labor Party
considers itself a Marxist-Leninist
Party. It dominates the
Worker-Student Alliance caucus in
SDS. It contends, that the
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class. Racial oppression
and national subjugation,
according to the PL-WSA analysis,
are subordinates. Its strategy for
building a revolutionary
movement is summed up in "build
a worker-student alliance," using
the growing student movement as
cadre to organize amongst the
American working class.
Disciplined Cadre
For the past several years PL
has operated as a disciplined
external cadre within SDS, with
members making decisions in
caucuses. PL's emphasis on the
working class led to the
development of "working-class
politics" in most of SDS, but it
dogmatism has always been
resented. The last straw, for many
SDS members, came when PL put
forward its position on
revolutionary nationalism. PL's
theoretical magazine said "All
nationalism is reactionary." PL
denounced the National
Liberation Front of South
Vietnam for being an alliance of
nationalist forces without a
Communist program, and said
that NLF leadership was selling
out its people by negotiating in
Paris. PL condemned the Black
Panther Party for putting forward
concepts of black community
control. And, after supporting the
SF State Strike and similar
struggles for months, PL
condemned demands for open
admission for Blacks, and for
Black studies. Such demands,
according to PL, are reverse racist

PL-WSA and Weatherman, RYM
II enjoys some popularity
amongst the Stanford chapter,
primarily from members of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union.
RYM II combines some of the
major ideological elements of the
former two factions.
II views imperialism as the
"major contradiction today," but
unlike Weatherman, it does not
conceive of revolution without
working class leadership—black
and white. The RYM II strategy
of "United Front Against

Imperialism" means that the
Movement should do mass work
with whity workers, to tie their
struggles to the struggles of their
class allies, the American blacks
and the Vietnamese. The
Richmond Oil Strike best
exemplifies this strategy. The
supposedly "racist" oil and
chemical workers by a 2 to 1
margin endorsed the Third World
strikes at San Francisco State and
Berkeley, for they learned that
the same people were fighting the
same enemy in Richmond and on
the campuses. In fact, the union
sent official delegations to walk
the campus strike picket lines.
No Legitimacy
RYM II believes that a
revolutionary movement has no
legitimacy, and cannot succeed,
unless it "serves the people." In
other words, the movement must
offer programs which will meet
the needs of oppressed people,
and relate those needs to a
long-range strategy.
RYM II is perhaps the closest
adherent of traditional
Marxism-Leninism within SDS.
RYM II feels centralism is
necessary for a revolutionary
movement, but wants to avoid the
development of a bureaucratic
authoritarian state (Russia). RYM
II sees the Chinese cultural
revolution as a model for
returning power to the people.
New Left The strength of the
preceeding three factions at the
National Convention rests
primarily on the importance, as
they see it, of dominating a
national organization. Perhaps the
largest group in SDS (easily such
at Stanford), un-organized and
without any clear written
statement of principles, grows out
of the New Left tradition which
has considered local activity the
basis of SDS. This tradition
de-emphasizes structured theory,
and is relatively new. However,
"New Leftists" like myself are
beginning to understand the
necessity of putting forward
coherent theoretical politics, and
may soon begin to do so.
RYM II urges the formation of
disciplined collectives, and
believes that a revolutionary
movement should be structured
around "democratic centralism,"
which means that the
organizational (party)
membership is subordinate to an
elected central committee. The
New Leftists, on the other hand,
believe in participatory
democracy and representative
democracy, with less stress on
discipline. When possible,
according to this philosophy,
people should be able to
participate in the decisions which
affect them. When not, their
representatives should attempt to
represent their views. The New
Left position often allows for
individual rejection of collective
decisions.
* * *
The results of the splits in SDS
are unclear. Stanford SDS is
unaffected by the nationwide
divisions. The Stanford chapter is
now participating in a Northern
California SDS Regional
Organization, made up of RYM 11,
New Left, and "uncommitted"
sentiments. Personally, I expect
this Northern California Region to
build a new multi-tendency mass
organization. Regardless, at this
point SDS nationally has little
meaning to the large Bay Area
movement.
In this article I have not
explained the deep analysis which
has convinced most SDS'ers to
become revolutionaries.lt would
be impossible to accurately
represent the thought behind
these conclusions here. Rather, I
suggest that people participate in
SDS programs and projects this
year.
Leonard Siegal

(Leonard Siege I is a suspended
student in physics and active mem
ber of the local SDS chapter. He
at tempts here to present the dif
ferences in philosophy that sprung
up during the SDS summer con
vention.)
The Students for a Democratic
Society has been, for the past few
years, the largest organization of
the radical American Left. SDS,
which built itself through
opposition to the Vietnam War
and the draft, and by pressing for
student power and university
reform, emerged last year as a
serious socialist, revolutionary
organization, with concerns
beyond the college campuses on
which it developed. This
development was recognized by
the American ruling class, which
escalated its attack, both verbal
and "legal," on SDS.
It appears now, though, that
SDS is experiencing the
clumsiness of the teenage
movement that grew too fast. The
splits and sectarianism in SDS, as
well as rampant disregard of
reality in many sectors, have just
about destroyed SDS's
development as a national
organization. But the enemies of
SDS should not take heart. The
Movement is much bigger than
any set of initials or organization.
The splits in SDS which
crystallized this summer are not
simple, and are closely tied to the
development of the movement.
Stanford SDS, and the radical
movement at Stanford, has been
relatively free of the divisions
which have plagued the
organization elsewhere. I will
attempt here to characterize the
different positions in SDS. The
reader should be warned that the
divisions are not left vs right, in
the traditional sense, and that in
fact, most of the factions claim to
be the left-wing of SDS. PL-WSA
the Progressive Labor Party
considers itself a Marxist-Leninist
Party. It dominates the
Worker-Student Alliance caucus in
SDS. It contends, that the
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class. Racial oppression
and national subjugation,
according to the PL-WSA analysis,
are subordinates. Its strategy for
building a revolutionary
movement is summed up in "build
a worker-student alliance," using
the growing student movement as
cadre to organize amongst the
American working class.
Disciplined Cadre
For the past several years PL
has operated as a disciplined
external cadre within SDS, with
members making decisions in
caucuses. PL's emphasis on the
working class led to the
development of "working-class
politics" in most of SDS, but it
dogmatism has always been
resented. The last straw, for many
SDS members, came when PL put
forward its position on
revolutionary nationalism. PL's
theoretical magazine said "All
nationalism is reactionary." PL
denounced the National
Liberation Front of South
Vietnam for being an alliance of
nationalist forces without a
Communist program, and said
that NLF leadership was selling
out its people by negotiating in
Paris. PL condemned the Black
Panther Party for putting forward
concepts of black community
control. And, after supporting the
SF State Strike and similar
struggles for months, PL
condemned demands for open
admission for Blacks, and for
Black studies. Such demands,
according to PL, are reverse racist
and nationalist. And in Berkeley,

PL opposed the People's Park
struggle, although it actively
opposed the military invasion of
Berkeley. Such positions are an
extreme extension of PL's
interpretation of building a
worker-student alliance. PL
opposes activities which it thinks
will turn off large numbers of
White workers.
Convention in Chicago this
summer, the WSA caucus
composed the largest bloc of
voting delegates. PL had chartered
planes (!) to bring its people to
Chicago. Factional anger grew to
the point at which the formal
national leaders of SDS led a
walk-out. At the assembly of the
delegates who left, a vote was
taken to "expel" PL and WSA
which do compose a minority in
SDS, but were well-represented at
the convention. The walk-out
group maintained control of the
national SDS office and facilities
in Chicago, so a shadow SDS
office was set up by WSA and a
few allies in Boston. Both groups
claim to be the real SDS.
WEATHERMAN Early this
summer a paper entitled "You
Don't Need a Weatherman to
Know Which Way the Wind
Blows" was circulated within
SDS. This paper, which drew a lot
of support, posited that "The
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
oppressed nation and the
oppressor nation." America's
internal colonies are considered
nations. The "revolutionary"
strategy which has evolved
considers students and white
workers adjuncts of black and
Third World revolutionary
movements, with the prime task
of supporting the blacks and
Third World liberation
movements. Weatherman expects
an American revolution soon, it
appears, for it has abandoned
most of its mass organizing. What
organizing it does do, is based
around the American tradition of
violence. Weatherman rejects
programs which purport to "serve
the people" as reformist, although
these programs often fit into a
revolutionary strategy.
Politics and Actions
Strangely enough,
Weatherman's politics and actions
(such as running through high
school shouting "Jailbreak!") has
drawn criticism from all sectors of
the left, including the black
organizations whose leadership
they claim to expect to follow in
an imminent revolution.
Weatherman spokesmen have
recently begun to rest on
dogmatism and sectarianism.
Everyone in SDS who criticizes
"the correct politics of
Weatherman" is labeled a
"running dog."
At the National Convention
members of Weatherman
collectives were elected as
National Officers of the group
that walked out. The officers have
since disowned any responsibility
to the membership of SDS. Their
responsibility is to the "Weather
Bureau"—the Weatherman
collectives.
RYM 11 The Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (Weatherman was
originally known as RYM I) was
the third largest group at the

now participating in a Northern
California SDS Regional
Organization, made up of RYM 11,
New Left, and "uncommitted"
sentiments. Personally, I expect
this Northern California Region to
build a new multi-tendency mass
organization. Regardless, at this
point SDS nationally has little
meaning to the large Bay Area
movement.
In this article I have not
explained the deep analysis which
has convinced most SDS'ers to
become revolutionaries.lt would
be impossible to accurately
represent the thought behind
these conclusions here. Rather, I
suggest that people participate in
SDS programs and projects this
year.

(Leonard Siege I is a suspended
student in physics and active mem
ber of the local SDS chapter. He
at tempts here to present the dif
ferences in philosophy that sprung
up during the SDS summer con
vention.)
The Students for a Democratic
Society has been, for the past few
years, the largest organization of
the radical American Left. SDS,
which built itself through
opposition to the Vietnam War
and the draft, and by pressing for
student power and university
reform, emerged last year as a
serious socialist, revolutionary
organization, with concerns
beyond the college campuses on
which it developed. This
development was recognized by
the American ruling class, which
escalated its attack, both verbal
and "legal," on SDS.
It appears now, though, that
SDS is experiencing the
clumsiness of the teenage
movement that grew too fast. The
splits and sectarianism in SDS, as
well as rampant disregard of
reality in many sectors, have just
about destroyed SDS's
development as a national
organization. But the enemies of
SDS should not take heart. The
Movement is much bigger than
any set of initials or organization.
The splits in SDS which
crystallized this summer are not
simple, and are closely tied to the
development of the movement.
Stanford SDS, and the radical
movement at Stanford, has been
relatively free of the divisions
which have plagued the
organization elsewhere. I will
attempt here to characterize the
different positions in SDS. The
reader should be warned that the
divisions are not left vs right, in
the traditional sense, and that in
fact, most of the factions claim to
be the left-wing of SDS. PL-WSA
the Progressive Labor Party
considers itself a Marxist-Leninist
Party. It dominates the
Worker-Student Alliance caucus in
SDS. It contends, that the
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class. Racial oppression
and national subjugation,
according to the PL-WSA analysis,
are subordinates. Its strategy for
building a revolutionary
movement is summed up in "build
a worker-student alliance," using
the growing student movement as
cadre to organize amongst the
American working class.
Disciplined Cadre
For the past several years PL
has operated as a disciplined
external cadre within SDS, with
members making decisions in
caucuses. PL's emphasis on the
working class led to the
development of "working-class
politics" in most of SDS, but it
dogmatism has always been
resented. The last straw, for many
SDS members, came when PL put
forward its position on
revolutionary nationalism. PL's
theoretical magazine said "All
nationalism is reactionary." PL
denounced the National
Liberation Front of South
Vietnam for being an alliance of
nationalist forces without a
Communist program, and said
that NLF leadership was selling
out its people by negotiating in
Paris. PL condemned the Black
Panther Party for putting forward
concepts of black community
control. And, after supporting the
SF State Strike and similar
struggles for months, PL
condemned demands for open
admission for Blacks, and for
Black studies. Such demands,
according to PL, are reverse racist
and nationalist. And in Berkeley,

PL opposed the People's Park
struggle, although it actively
opposed the military invasion of
Berkeley. Such positions are an
extreme extension of PL's
interpretation of building a
worker-student alliance. PL
opposes activities which it thinks
will turn off large numbers of
White workers.
Convention in Chicago this
summer, the WSA caucus
composed the largest bloc of
voting delegates. PL had chartered
planes (!) to bring its people to
Chicago. Factional anger grew to
the point at which the formal
national leaders of SDS led a
walk-out. At the assembly of the
delegates who left, a vote was
taken to "expel" PL and WSA
which do compose a minority in
SDS, but were well-represented at
the convention. The walk-out
group maintained control of the
national SDS office and facilities
in Chicago, so a shadow SDS
office was set up by WSA and a
few allies in Boston. Both groups
claim to be the real SDS.
WEATHERMAN Early this
summer a paper entitled "You
Don't Need a Weatherman to
Know Which Way the Wind
Blows" was circulated within
SDS. This paper, which drew a lot
of support, posited that "The
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
oppressed nation and the
oppressor nation." America's
internal colonies are considered
nations. The "revolutionary"
strategy which has evolved
considers students and white
workers adjuncts of black and
Third World revolutionary
movements, with the prime task
of supporting the blacks and
Third World liberation
movements. Weatherman expects
an American revolution soon, it
appears, for it has abandoned
most of its mass organizing. What
organizing it does do, is based
around the American tradition of
violence. Weatherman rejects
programs which purport to "serve
the people" as reformist, although
these programs often fit into a
revolutionary strategy.
Politics and Actions
Strangely enough,
Weatherman's politics and actions
(such as running through high
school shouting "Jailbreak!") has
drawn criticism from all sectors of
the left, including the black
organizations whose leadership
they claim to expect to follow in
an imminent revolution.
Weatherman spokesmen have
recently begun to rest on
dogmatism and sectarianism.
Everyone in SDS who criticizes
"the correct politics of
Weatherman" is labeled a
"running dog."
At the National Convention
members of Weatherman
collectives were elected as
National Officers of the group
that walked out. The officers have
since disowned any responsibility
to the membership of SDS. Their
responsibility is to the "Weather
Bureau"—the Weatherman
collectives.
RYM 11 The Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (Weatherman was
originally known as RYM I) was
the third largest group at the
National Convention. Unlike
PL-WSA and Weatherman, RYM
II enjoys some popularity
amongst the Stanford chapter,
primarily from members of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union.
RYM II combines some of the
major ideological elements of the
former two factions.
II views imperialism as the
"major contradiction today," but
unlike Weatherman, it does not
conceive of revolution without
working class leadership—black
and white. The RYM II strategy
of "United Front Against

Imperialism" means that the
Movement should do mass work
with whity workers, to tie their
struggles to the struggles of their
class allies, the American blacks
and the Vietnamese. The
Richmond Oil Strike best
exemplifies this strategy. The
supposedly "racist" oil and
chemical workers by a 2 to 1
margin endorsed the Third World
strikes at San Francisco State and
Berkeley, for they learned that
the same people were fighting the
same enemy in Richmond and on
the campuses. In fact, the union
sent official delegations to walk
the campus strike picket lines.
No Legitimacy
RYM II believes that a
revolutionary movement has no
legitimacy, and cannot succeed,
unless it "serves the people." In
other words, the movement must
offer programs which will meet
the needs of oppressed people,
and relate those needs to a
long-range strategy.
RYM II is perhaps the closest
adherent of traditional
Marxism-Leninism within SDS.
RYM II feels centralism is
necessary for a revolutionary
movement, but wants to avoid the
development of a bureaucratic
authoritarian state (Russia). RYM
II sees the Chinese cultural
revolution as a model for
returning power to the people.
New Left The strength of the
preceeding three factions at the
National Convention rests
primarily on the importance, as
they see it, of dominating a
national organization. Perhaps the
largest group in SDS (easily such
at Stanford), un-organized and
without any clear written
statement of principles, grows out
of the New Left tradition which
has considered local activity the
basis of SDS. This tradition
de-emphasizes structured theory,
and is relatively new. However,
"New Leftists" like myself are
beginning to understand the
necessity of putting forward
coherent theoretical politics, and
may soon begin to do so.
RYM II urges the formation of
disciplined collectives, and
believes that a revolutionary
movement should be structured
around "democratic centralism,"
which means that the
organizational (party)
membership is subordinate to an
elected central committee. The
New Leftists, on the other hand,
believe in participatory
democracy and representative
democracy, with less stress on
discipline. When possible,
according to this philosophy,
people should be able to
participate in the decisions which
affect them. When not, their
representatives should attempt to
represent their views. The New
Left position often allows for
individual rejection of collective
decisions.

development of "working-class
politics" in most of SDS, but it
dogmatism has always been
resented. The last straw, for many
SDS members, came when PL put
forward its position on
revolutionary nationalism. PL's
theoretical magazine said "All
nationalism is reactionary." PL
denounced the National
Liberation Front of South
Vietnam for being an alliance of
nationalist forces without a
Communist program, and said
that NLF leadership was selling
out its people by negotiating in
Paris. PL condemned the Black
Panther Party for putting forward
concepts of black community
control. And, after supporting the
SF State Strike and similar
struggles for months, PL
condemned demands for open
admission for Blacks, and for
Black studies. Such demands,
according to PL, are reverse racist
and nationalist. And in Berkeley,

PL opposed the People's Park
struggle, although it actively
opposed the military invasion of
Berkeley. Such positions are an
extreme extension of PL's
interpretation of building a
worker-student alliance. PL
opposes activities which it thinks
will turn off large numbers of
White workers.
Convention in Chicago this
summer, the WSA caucus
composed the largest bloc of
voting delegates. PL had chartered
planes (!) to bring its people to
Chicago. Factional anger grew to
the point at which the formal
national leaders of SDS led a
walk-out. At the assembly of the
delegates who left, a vote was
taken to "expel" PL and WSA
which do compose a minority in
SDS, but were well-represented at
the convention. The walk-out
group maintained control of the
national SDS office and facilities
in Chicago, so a shadow SDS
office was set up by WSA and a
few allies in Boston. Both groups
claim to be the real SDS.
WEATHERMAN Early this
summer a paper entitled "You
Don't Need a Weatherman to
Know Which Way the Wind
Blows" was circulated within
SDS. This paper, which drew a lot
of support, posited that "The
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
oppressed nation and the
oppressor nation." America's
internal colonies are considered
nations. The "revolutionary"
strategy which has evolved
considers students and white
workers adjuncts of black and
Third World revolutionary
movements, with the prime task
of supporting the blacks and
Third World liberation
movements. Weatherman expects
an American revolution soon, it
appears, for it has abandoned
most of its mass organizing. What
organizing it does do, is based
around the American tradition of
violence. Weatherman rejects
programs which purport to "serve
the people" as reformist, although
these programs often fit into a
revolutionary strategy.
Politics and Actions
Strangely enough,
Weatherman's politics and actions
(such as running through high
school shouting "Jailbreak!") has
drawn criticism from all sectors of
the left, including the black
organizations whose leadership
they claim to expect to follow in
an imminent revolution.
Weatherman spokesmen have
recently begun to rest on
dogmatism and sectarianism.
Everyone in SDS who criticizes
"the correct politics of
Weatherman" is labeled a
"running dog."
At the National Convention
members of Weatherman
collectives were elected as
National Officers of the group
that walked out. The officers have
since disowned any responsibility
to the membership of SDS. Their
responsibility is to the "Weather
Bureau"—the Weatherman
collectives.
RYM 11 The Revolutionary Youth
Movement II (Weatherman was
originally known as RYM I) was
the third largest group at the
National Convention. Unlike
PL-WSA and Weatherman, RYM
II enjoys some popularity
amongst the Stanford chapter,
primarily from members of the
Bay Area Revolutionary Union.
RYM II combines some of the
major ideological elements of the
former two factions.
II views imperialism as the
"major contradiction today," but
unlike Weatherman, it does not
conceive of revolution without
working class leadership—black
and white. The RYM II strategy
of "United Front Against

Imperialism" means that the
Movement should do mass work
with whity workers, to tie their
struggles to the struggles of their
class allies, the American blacks
and the Vietnamese. The
Richmond Oil Strike best
exemplifies this strategy. The
supposedly "racist" oil and
chemical workers by a 2 to 1
margin endorsed the Third World
strikes at San Francisco State and
Berkeley, for they learned that
the same people were fighting the
same enemy in Richmond and on
the campuses. In fact, the union
sent official delegations to walk
the campus strike picket lines.
No Legitimacy
RYM II believes that a
revolutionary movement has no
legitimacy, and cannot succeed,
unless it "serves the people." In
other words, the movement must
offer programs which will meet
the needs of oppressed people,
and relate those needs to a
long-range strategy.
RYM II is perhaps the closest
adherent of traditional
Marxism-Leninism within SDS.
RYM II feels centralism is
necessary for a revolutionary
movement, but wants to avoid the
development of a bureaucratic
authoritarian state (Russia). RYM
II sees the Chinese cultural
revolution as a model for
returning power to the people.
New Left The strength of the
preceeding three factions at the
National Convention rests
primarily on the importance, as
they see it, of dominating a
national organization. Perhaps the
largest group in SDS (easily such
at Stanford), un-organized and
without any clear written
statement of principles, grows out
of the New Left tradition which
has considered local activity the
basis of SDS. This tradition
de-emphasizes structured theory,
and is relatively new. However,
"New Leftists" like myself are
beginning to understand the
necessity of putting forward
coherent theoretical politics, and
may soon begin to do so.
RYM II urges the formation of
disciplined collectives, and
believes that a revolutionary
movement should be structured
around "democratic centralism,"
which means that the
organizational (party)
membership is subordinate to an
elected central committee. The
New Leftists, on the other hand,
believe in participatory
democracy and representative
democracy, with less stress on
discipline. When possible,
according to this philosophy,
people should be able to
participate in the decisions which
affect them. When not, their
representatives should attempt to
represent their views. The New
Left position often allows for
individual rejection of collective
decisions.

The results of the splits in SDS
are unclear. Stanford SDS is
unaffected by the nationwide
divisions. The Stanford chapter is
now participating in a Northern
California SDS Regional
Organization, made up of RYM 11,
New Left, and "uncommitted"
sentiments. Personally, I expect
this Northern California Region to
build a new multi-tendency mass
organization. Regardless, at this
point SDS nationally has little
meaning to the large Bay Area
movement.
In this article I have not
explained the deep analysis which
has convinced most SDS'ers to
become revolutionaries.lt would
be impossible to accurately
represent the thought behind
these conclusions here. Rather, I
suggest that people participate in
SDS programs and projects this
year.
Leonard Siegal

(Leonard Siege I is a suspended
student in physics and active mem
ber of the local SDS chapter. He
at tempts here to present the dif
ferences in philosophy that sprung
up during the SDS summer con
vention.)
The Students for a Democratic
Society has been, for the past few
years, the largest organization of
the radical American Left. SDS,
which built itself through
opposition to the Vietnam War
and the draft, and by pressing for
student power and university
reform, emerged last year as a
serious socialist, revolutionary
organization, with concerns
beyond the college campuses on
which it developed. This
development was recognized by
the American ruling class, which
escalated its attack, both verbal
and "legal," on SDS.
It appears now, though, that
SDS is experiencing the
clumsiness of the teenage
movement that grew too fast. The
splits and sectarianism in SDS, as
well as rampant disregard of
reality in many sectors, have just
about destroyed SDS's
development as a national
organization. But the enemies of
SDS should not take heart. The
Movement is much bigger than
any set of initials or organization.
The splits in SDS which
crystallized this summer are not
simple, and are closely tied to the
development of the movement.
Stanford SDS, and the radical
movement at Stanford, has been
relatively free of the divisions
which have plagued the
organization elsewhere. I will
attempt here to characterize the
different positions in SDS. The
reader should be warned that the
divisions are not left vs right, in
the traditional sense, and that in
fact, most of the factions claim to
be the left-wing of SDS. PL-WSA
the Progressive Labor Party
considers itself a Marxist-Leninist
Party. It dominates the
Worker-Student Alliance caucus in
SDS. It contends, that the
primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class. Racial oppression
and national subjugation,
according to the PL-WSA analysis,
are subordinates. Its strategy for
building a revolutionary
movement is summed up in "build
a worker-student alliance," using
the growing student movement as
cadre to organize amongst the
American working class.
Disciplined Cadre
For the past several years PL
has operated as a disciplined
external cadre within SDS, with
members making decisions in
caucuses. PL's emphasis on the
working class led to the
development of "working-class
politics" in most of SDS, but it
dogmatism has always been
resented. The last straw, for many
SDS members, came when PL put
forward its position on
revolutionary nationalism. PL's
theoretical magazine said "All
nationalism is reactionary." PL
denounced the National
Liberation Front of South
Vietnam for being an alliance of
