## Letter From Israel

JERUSALEM, SEPTEMBER
24, 1969—Ariel comes home
almost every weekend. It's a long
busride, but it's worth it to him to
spend a quiet day or two in his
parents' comfortable apartment in
the suburbs of Jeruselem.
Twenty years old, Ariel, is a
high school graduate and, quite
recently, a graduate of a
six-month officers' training course
in the Israli Army. As a second
lieutenant his usual duty is to
direct the scouting party that
precedes by several kilometers a
column of tanks as it moves in the
Sinai desert.
The morning of September 10,
he participated in the raid across
the gulf of Suez against a series of
Egyptian army bases.
"I read the Time report on the
raid and was amused. They tried
to make it more romantic than it
was," he said. Ariel knows no
Arabic and said the raiding party
wore their regular Israeli
uniforms—not captured Arab
uniforms as Time reported.
Ariel claimed the raiding party
knew from intelligence reports
beforehand that there would be
minimal Arab response to the raid
while it was taking place. But they
were surprised a bit by the
unreadiness of the Egyptians to
offer any resistance at all. He said
at several army camps the
Egyptians heard the raiding party
was approaching, and garrison
marched out with hands up to
meet them.
Ariel did not say what
happened to the surrendering
Egyptians. But he complained
that they could not be expected
to fight since most of their
officers had fled.
"An army is only as good as its
officers," he intoned. "In Israel
the officer always goes in front of
his men. I cannot ask my men to
do anything I am not ready to
lead them in doing."
I asked if he thought that was
the reason for Israel's military
successes. "That and this, that we
know that we can only lose once.
The Arabs will destroy us if we
lose. They can afford to lose again
and again. They have more
people."
"Also in Israel we learn our

jobs well, and we drill on them
again and again. The Russians can
train the Arabs all they want, but
because they will not exert
themselves to learn and to
practice, they will not become a
good army."
What about the long-range
implications of raids like the one
September 10? He said he did not
know about politics. But he was
proud that September 10 was the
first time that Israel has been able
to put tanks on the other side of
the Gulf and bring them back.
At his age American youths
turn to questioning the
government and the reasons for
the war in which we are
embroiled. Ariel says he might go
to the university after his three
years of military service are up.
But I sense the university here will
not lead him to question the
reprisal mentality of Israel's
leaders.
Now for him the problems are
simple. He gets about $10 a
month as a salary. If he signs up
for another term, might get
$100-with food and room, a
decent living for an Israeli.
He complained that some of his
officer friends had to serve as
much as two months on the Canal
without going home. That is
almost unheard of in Israel. He
said he could not understand how
American troops could stand to
spend a year in Vietnam without
coming home.
I allowed as how I couldn't
understand it either.
Wiry, occasionally fingering his
glasses, when we were discussing
the reasons for Israeli military
successes, he said, "The people in
our army are simple men. But
they are trained well and they
practice all the time. We are not
heroes; we are only simple men."
I cannot help but feel that, in
spite of their intelligence, many
Israelis are too simple—too
involved in the small problems to
see that the solution of the large
problem of war and peace cannot
be expected to procede from the
policy of reprisal.

know about politics. But he was
proud that September 10 was the
first time that Israel has been able
to put tanks on the other side of
the Gulf and bring them back.
At his age American youths
turn to questioning the
government and the reasons for
the war in which we are
embroiled. Ariel says he might go
to the university after his three
years of military service are up.
But I sense the university here will
not lead him to question the
reprisal mentality of Israel's
leaders.
Now for him the problems are
simple. He gets about $10 a
month as a salary. If he signs up
for another term, might get
$100-with food and room, a
decent living for an Israeli.
He complained that some of his
officer friends had to serve as
much as two months on the Canal
without going home. That is
almost unheard of in Israel. He
said he could not understand how
American troops could stand to
spend a year in Vietnam without
coming home.
I allowed as how I couldn't
understand it either.
Wiry, occasionally fingering his
glasses, when we were discussing
the reasons for Israeli military
successes, he said, "The people in
our army are simple men. But
they are trained well and they
practice all the time. We are not
heroes; we are only simple men."
I cannot help but feel that, in
spite of their intelligence, many
Israelis are too simple—too
involved in the small problems to
see that the solution of the large
problem of war and peace cannot
be expected to procede from the
policy of reprisal.

JERUSALEM, SEPTEMBER
24, 1969—Ariel comes home
almost every weekend. It's a long
busride, but it's worth it to him to
spend a quiet day or two in his
parents' comfortable apartment in
the suburbs of Jeruselem.
Twenty years old, Ariel, is a
high school graduate and, quite
recently, a graduate of a
six-month officers' training course
in the Israli Army. As a second
lieutenant his usual duty is to
direct the scouting party that
precedes by several kilometers a
column of tanks as it moves in the
Sinai desert.
The morning of September 10,
he participated in the raid across
the gulf of Suez against a series of
Egyptian army bases.
"I read the Time report on the
raid and was amused. They tried
to make it more romantic than it
was," he said. Ariel knows no
Arabic and said the raiding party
wore their regular Israeli
uniforms—not captured Arab
uniforms as Time reported.
Ariel claimed the raiding party
knew from intelligence reports
beforehand that there would be
minimal Arab response to the raid
while it was taking place. But they
were surprised a bit by the
unreadiness of the Egyptians to
offer any resistance at all. He said
at several army camps the
Egyptians heard the raiding party
was approaching, and garrison
marched out with hands up to
meet them.
Ariel did not say what
happened to the surrendering
Egyptians. But he complained
that they could not be expected
to fight since most of their
officers had fled.
"An army is only as good as its
officers," he intoned. "In Israel
the officer always goes in front of
his men. I cannot ask my men to
do anything I am not ready to
lead them in doing."
I asked if he thought that was
the reason for Israel's military
successes. "That and this, that we
know that we can only lose once.
The Arabs will destroy us if we
lose. They can afford to lose again
and again. They have more
people."
"Also in Israel we learn our

jobs well, and we drill on them
again and again. The Russians can
train the Arabs all they want, but
because they will not exert
themselves to learn and to
practice, they will not become a
good army."
What about the long-range
implications of raids like the one
September 10? He said he did not
know about politics. But he was
proud that September 10 was the
first time that Israel has been able
to put tanks on the other side of
