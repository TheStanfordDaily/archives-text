# Summer's Films Reviewed
## Erratic Films Mark Summer Season 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,


EASY RIDFR: Peter Fonda is too stoned to represent anyone but himself as he
and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."


MIDNIGHT COWBOY: Joe Buck and RaLso visit the grave of Ratso's father in
John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from

Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so

exciting yet less totally satisfying

first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,


EASY RIDFR: Peter Fonda is too stoned to represent anyone but himself as he
and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."


MIDNIGHT COWBOY: Joe Buck and RaLso visit the grave of Ratso's father in
John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.

before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,

and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."

given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go

are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,

and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."

John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly

rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,

Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.

lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,


EASY RIDFR: Peter Fonda is too stoned to represent anyone but himself as he
and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."


MIDNIGHT COWBOY: Joe Buck and RaLso visit the grave of Ratso's father in
John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.

careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,


EASY RIDFR: Peter Fonda is too stoned to represent anyone but himself as he
and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."


MIDNIGHT COWBOY: Joe Buck and RaLso visit the grave of Ratso's father in
John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike

the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,


EASY RIDFR: Peter Fonda is too stoned to represent anyone but himself as he
and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."


MIDNIGHT COWBOY: Joe Buck and RaLso visit the grave of Ratso's father in
John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what

returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his
life to this project and he must be
classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles
and an extension of all three.
Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape
seemed awkward and unnatural in
what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
Fortunately, the four youn
protagonists are portrayed not as
symbols for various nebulus
groups of "youth" but as totally
believable individuals and director
Frank Perry keeps any
superfluous attempts at a "now"
generation, television commercial
look to a bare minimum.
Midnight Cowboy
Here is another film in which
the acting and dialogue are
consistantly engrossing and
credible but which isn't all that it
could or should have been. The
fault, by default, lies with director
John Schlesinger, whose visual
graishness is sometimes more
obscene and repulsive than the
events depicted. Furthermore, I
think it's about time directors
stopped grinding their narratives
to a halt in order to insert
relatively expressiveless montages
of people walking to the
accompaniment of pop tunes, no
matter how nice the songs might
be. This technique is reminiscent
of student film making at its
worst and certainly one that need
not be incorporated into feature
productions and hailed as "an
advance," despite the dubious
success of The Graduate and A
Man and a Woman in such
ventures.
Despite my irritability, I
enjoyed Midnight Cowboy, as Jon
Voight fulfilled the potential I
thought he displayed in a play
(Frank Gilroy's ill-fated That
Summer-That Fall) I saw four
years ago in Chicago. Two
minutes of close-up of Dustin
Hoffman as Ratso is enough to
make even his teeny-bopper fans
sick and Schlesinger is at least
benevolent enough to offer us
Viva fully clothed.
True Grit
Granted, a reasonably
entertaining western, but I still
wonder what behind-the-scenes
shenanigans went on in order to
get John Wayne cover coverage in
our most widely read national
magazines and to persuade the
critics to forget The Green Berets
and The Hellfighters (now that I
think of it, the latter wouldn't be
too dillicult a task).
The Duke's appearance here is a
good one, but I think Andrew
Sarris was absolutely correct in
setting forth that many fine actors
(Cagney, Bogart, Muni and now
Wayne) were able to attain
cultural esteem and respectability
in their later years after long
careers of solid acting by donning
old-age makeup, a trick accent or
an eyepatch and thereby
convincing a gullible public that
they are, after all, fine actors.

The Wild Bunch
There is no argument that
Peckinpah directed with
tremendous force and style but
judged as a western sage, I
couldn't get as involved with the
characters here as I could, say, in
The Magnificent Seven. Though
this may sound old-fashioned and
even irrelevant, I think this
emotional distancing is what
prevented it from being totally
satisfying.
The film hit people as
anywhere from pleasantly rough
to stomach-churning and while
throat-slitting in closeup isn't
exactly my bag, no amount of
free-flowing blood will disguise
that we are watching Hollywood
actors. Films still haven't caught
up with politics in the realm of
violence.
The April Fools
An abomination which offers a
script of a sub-television situation
comedy level. In that Jack
Lemmon now appears in just one
film a year and Catherine Deneuve
was making her long-awaited
American film debut, one would
think that both of them would
have been more careful in their
script selection.
It is no mean film which boasts
a cast of the above stars, Myrna
Loy, Charles Boyer and Jack
Weston and then allows Peter
Lawford to come off best. Stuart
Rosenberg, after a sometimes
striking display of talent in Cool
Hand Luke, here betrays one of
the most artsy-craftsy sensibilities
in Hollywood.
Popi
A surprisingly affecting and
amusing picture. A substantial
merit which isn't immediately
apparent is that the New York
ghetto setting is accepted at the
outset as a fact of life and is used
integrally in the action, not set
aside for the purpose of
sociological polemicizing and
lambasting.
The film hovers precariously at
times between straight comedy
and heavy drama and it somehow
changes tone when Popi and
company arrive in Miami. While
Alan Arkin's performance is very
appealing, he has convinced me
throughout his career of his
versatility to the point at which I
would like to see him tackle a part
a little closer to home and which
might reveal something of his own
personality (his next appearance
will be as Yossarian in Mike
Nichols' Catch-22).
Justine
No, this film does not
successfully render Laurence
Durrell's Alexandria Quartet on
the screen but taken strictly on its
own terms, the picture is
reasonably engrossing. Under the
thoroughly professional guidance
of George Cukor, the personal and
political motivations in the film
are never fully explained, but
Justine shows us how a thirties'
melodrama might have looked had
homosexuality, incest, perversion,
etc., et al., then been acceptable
subjects for screen treatment. The
mystique of Anouk Aimee is
somehow second-rate (though
certainly not less than that) and
had Anna Karina been given more
footage, she would have
dominated the picture. Dirk
Bogarde's career becomes more
interesting and admirable with
each film and a varied array of
supporting players and
characteactors acquit themselves
convincingly.
Castle Keep
Henry (The 400 Blows) Dacae's
photography often reaches
stunning, surrealistic proportions,
but full realization of this anti-war
allegory is beyond the powers of
director Sydney Pollack and
Burt Lancaster.
This staging of the defense of a
medevil castle by G.l.'s during
WWII often digresses into action

for action's sake, with both
excitement and potential
intellectual meaning being lost
somewhere on the battlefield. The
language and antics of the soldiers
are often amusing but never really
surprising. Despite any exalted
aims on the parts of the film
makers, Hollywood still dictates
that a war film have action and
mass appeal, even if it does carry
an R rating.
Staircase
It is to the credit of Rex
Harrison, Richard Burton and
Stanley Donen that Charles Dyer's
unmercifully extended play has
now been made at least bearable,
for what was almost three hours
on stage is now just a shade over
90 minutes. Both Harrison and
Burton appear more into their
roles here than they have in recent
pictures, though they are
hampered by some awful, overly
calculated few lines. As for the
accomplished Donen, he is more
subdued than before, which is to
say he rightfully trusts his actors
and mistakenly trusts his material.
The film will probably prove more
rewarding to the film buff than to
the sensation seeker or star gazer,
as subtle virtues can be found in
Chris Challis' photography and in
the score by the multi-talented
Dudley Moore.
Easy Rider
It is difficult to come to terms
with this picture, for it was
initially endowed with misleading
stature by the Cannes Film
Festival, which cited it as "best
film by a new director" (out of a
competitive field of two), and by
the New York critics, some of
whom called it something like
"the definitive odyssey of youth
in the *60's." It is neither the
latter nor the typical motorcycle
film.
Peter Fonda and Dennis
Hopper are too oblique and
literally too stoned to be taken as
seriously representing anything
but themselves, while the brief
appearance of Jack Nicholson
injects an element of humor and
humanity which would have been
welcome outside the confines of
his scenes. The film does offer
some generalized truths about
American society, but there is
nothing we haven't known abou
before.
Yet another attempt to
externalize a drug experience is as
tiresome as the wanderers' passing
through John Ford's Monument
Valley is joyous. The young film
makers will make a mint from
their fling with the establishment.
Three Into Two Won't Go
This is probably the most
successfully executed films to
have been released so far this year,


EASY RIDFR: Peter Fonda is too stoned to represent anyone but himself as he
and Dennis Hopper "search lor America."


MIDNIGHT COWBOY: Joe Buck and RaLso visit the grave of Ratso's father in
John Schlesinger's garish but powerful film.
given the limitations of its
conception. As domestic dramas
aren't currently the order of the
day, this British production has
gone overlooked by critics and
audiences alike. It seems to me
tha individual responses to this
film would be along the order of
the reactions to last year's Petulia:
one either makes a connection
with the film's wave length and
likes it very much or one can't get
into it and finds it entirely
unappealing. Rod Steiger, Claire
Bloom and Judy Geeson give
strong, seemingly deeply felt
performances and Francis Lai's
score is very fine.
The Learning Tree
Director Gordon Parks made a
comment to the effect tha he
made sure that each of his shots
began and ended with beautifully
framed compositions. He really
didn't have to worry much about
that, for he rarely moves his
camera during a take.
Parks' first film is neither
offensive nor terribly appealing
and while I'll give the man
another chance, he betrays
tendancies of becoming a black
Stanley Kramer, a phenomenon
which I, for one, can do without.
In Mr. Parks' world, black
mothers are still Aunt Jemimah's
and the only mean or angry blacks
are criminally motivated in the
first place. The field's still open.
This ugly duckling story is
blessed with a sparkling, sensitive
script and a rather remarkable
performance by Patty Duke, who
has apparently recuperated from
Valley of the* Dolls. The film
occasionally falls into the
generation gap trap but managers
to keep its head above any
cliche-infested water most of the
way. Playing one of Natalie's

more repulsive dates is Bob
Balaban, who picked i-p Jon
Voight on 4 2nd Street in
Midnight Cowboy, and Last
Summer's remarkable Cathy
Burns is seen for some five
seconds. Rod McKuen go home.
Medium Cool
This film, which opens here
today, has received a ridiculous
amount of praise from critics for
the popular press, who are ever
anxious to be first to perform
literary acrobatics over a picture
which looks as if it's going to be
"in." After the totally illogical
finale and final fadeout, much of
the opening night New York art
house crowd broke into applause,
an act which I can only interpret
as self-righteous liberals
responding to a radical who seems
to make sense to their own
interpretive faculties.
Politically or otherwise,
director Haskell Waxier makes no
sense at all.
Not that a film must posit a
political viewpoint, but when
you've got little story and
uninteresting characters, you
better have something besides
Wexler's expectedly fine
photography.
Wexler has been praised for his
footage of the Democratic
National Convention and the
seismic surrounding events, but
what this amounts to is Robert
Forster wandering around the
Amphitheatre and a mother
inexplicably searching for her
young son amidst a group of
variously deployed demonstrators.
A couple of sequences are
arresting and Wexler suggests a
few intriguing intellectual ideas a
la Godard, but these merely
highlight the weaknesses in
Wexler's jumbled scenario and
eclectic direction.
Much as we are too close to
current product to make any
predictions concerning film trends
and future directions of the
cinema, there were several films
released over the past sumnjer
which, in a loose sense, had a trait
in common: the current American
social scene was taken for granted
and the stories, characters and
incidents depicted picked up from
there, with heavy-handed, Stanley
Kramer-ish sociological
pronouncements being virtually
dispensed with.
Easy Rider, Last Summer,
Midnight Cowboy, Medium Cool
and even Popi belong in this
group, as do Alice's Restaurant,
Putney Swope and a European
variation More, which I saw in

New York but are as yet
unreleased in San Francisco.
None of these films is entirely
successful, partially due to
structural deficiencies and largely
because the creative visions
involved are young, hazy and at
times undecided. Nonetheless,
tentative commitments have been
made by the respective film
makers and what has resulted so
far is a movie season more
exciting yet less totally satisfying
than any in the past several years.
Following are brief critiques of
the major films to have been
released over the past four
months:
Once Upon a Time in the West
Sergio Leone has exhausted
himself in his own genre of the
western Italiano, for what was
hilariously exciting in For a Few-
Dollars More and excitingly
hilarious in The Good, the Bad
and the Ugly is now deadeningly
vacuous in this exercise in
self-indulgence. Whereas Leone
was previously able to justify even
the most irrelevant and extended
sequences with humorous and
outlandish embellishments, scenes
in his latest picture with the
admittedly ravishing Claudia
Cardinale staring at herself in a
mirror and Henry Fonda and
Charles Bronson gawking at each
other for what seems like hours
before the final shoot-out, are no
more than that. The castings of
Fonda and Jason Robards are
off-beat and intriguing, but even
Ennio Morricone's score is a
disappointment.

Fortunately, Leone is now
moving on to new territory with
Once Upon a Time in America
which is set in the prohibition era,
and how he will function within
the confines of small,
underground rooms and narrow
city streets remains a question the
answer to which some of us still
look forward to.
Hard Contract
Certainly one of the forgotten
films of the year and deservedly
so. 20th Century-Fox's
acceptance of S. Lee Pogostin's
presumably serious and significant
script on the nature of violence
was no small mistake, but
all wing him to direct and
embarrass such accomplished
thespians as Lee Remick, Lilli
Palmer and Patrick Magee was
nothing short of a crime.
Pogostin's continual and
subliminally sleep-inducing use of
overlapping sound would have
appeared crude even in pre-Citizen
Kane days. For film critics only.
Winning
What might have been just
another melodrama off the
Universal assembly line was given
stature by the timely pairing of
Paul Newman and Joanne
Woodward, warmth by a

surprisingly honest script and
movement by an unknown
director. James Goldstone. And
for once, an adolescent was
portrayed with a reasonable sense
of credibility in a Hollywood
picture, thanks to Bruce
Davidson, who also appeared in
Last Summer.
By no means a significant or
really important movie, but it is a
measure of the film's tightness
and humanity that the racing
sequences were among the most
uninteresting. As they say, a good
evening's entertainment.
As I attended this film at Radio
City Music Hall in New York, I
realized that this famed
showplace, replete with the
leg-lifting Rockettes, patriotic flag
waving and grand pipe organ, is
one of the last bastions of the old

Anglo-Saxon heritage left on the
American cultural scene. When I
returned later in the summer for
True Grit, however, a few
well-scrubbed blacks had been
added to the entertainment
program though the dance line
had remained, as it were, pure.
War and Peace
The most expensive, lavish and
spectacular film of all-time finally
opened in San Francisco this
summer and is absolutely worth
seeing if only for the reasons
implied by the above adjectives.
Producer, director, co-writer and
star Sergei Bondarchuk entirely
devoted at least six years of his

classified as some kind of cross
between Cecil B. de Mille, Eric
von Stroheim and Orson Welles

Bondarchuk moves his 70mm
camera continually, whether it be
on tracks, aerial suspended wires
or in a balloon or helicopter. In
doing so, he achieves some of the
most astonishing shots and effects
ever recorded on celluloid. For all
the film's length, however, the
Pierre-Natasha relationship was
unduly breviated and never
reached the desired emotional
pitch, despite a sensitive portrayal
bv Bondarchuk.

Last Summer
This film hit home in so many
ways and was natural in so many
passages that it's a shame that
total credibility was lost amidst an
entanglement of plot contrivances
and attempts at allegory. The
entire sea gull incident, the
computer date and climactic rape

what is otherwise a penetrating
study of teenagers during what is
already an awkward stage of
development.
