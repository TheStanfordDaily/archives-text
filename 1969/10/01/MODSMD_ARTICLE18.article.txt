# Film Marathon Tonight
## 
### 
A 399-minute marathon of
student films will be shown by the
department of communication
tonight at Cubberley Auditorium.
All films were finalists, winners,
or won Honorable Mentions at the
Fourth National Student Film
Festival held in New York last
spring, which was judged by such
"names" as Andrew Sarris, Milos
Forman and D.A. Pennebaker.
The films range from 3 to 44
minutes in length, and from
moderately amusing to
excruciatingly boring and are

most notable for their extensive
use of unusual visual effects.
These most often are substitutes
for solid construction, a story, or
good acting, but they're easy on
the eyes.
A highlight of the program,
Sean, is a cute, 15-minute
interview with a 4Vi year-old boy
living in a Haight-Ashbury crash
pad.
The program will begin at 8
o'clock and run some 6 hours and
40 minutes, or until the
auditorium is empty, whichever
comes first.
