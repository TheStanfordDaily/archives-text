# Beatles, Bogart., Belmondo Star On Campus This Week
## 
### TODD McCarthy 
This year's movie season gets
off to an exciting start with
showings of the neglected first
film of the "New Wave"
movement, the Beatles' cartoon
trip and a remarkable pairing at
Tresidder this weekend of the best
films of two of the most
formidable "tough guys" in
cinema history, the
complimentary and comparable
Humphrey Bogart and Jean-Paul
Belmondo.
Plagued upon its release in
19 5 8 by unsympathetic,
downbeat reviews, Claude
Chabrol's Les Cousins was quickly
overshadowed by the successes of
The 400 Hlows and Hreathless and
Chabrol became a forgotten figure
of the nouvelle vogue as fellow
critics Truffaut and Godard
emerged as new masters of the
medium (Chabrol achieved his
first degree of commercial success
only last year with Les Biches, a
project whose popularity
probably rests more with its
erroneously suggestive title than
with its inherent virtues).
Les Cousins is surprisingly slick
and commercial-looking for a film
made on $160,000 and Pauline
Kael may be right in appraising
arthouse audiences as taking
awkward, pretentious technique
too seriously and thereby passing
by a stylish work like Chabrol's.
Jean-Claude Brialy stars in this
modern country mouse—city
mouse story, which will be shown
by the International Film Society
at 8:15 on Thursday in
Cubberley.
The Sky Above—The Mud
Below was highly acclaimed in
1961 as a brilliant and
occasionally sensational expose of*
the headhunter culture of the

obscure reaches of New Guinea.
The documentary was further
exploited by the fact that our of a
34 member exploration crew,
only two were able to complete
the journey. However, this
Academy Award winner seems
rather conventional today, in an
era when the presentation of
undraped natives and presumably
perverse death no longer serve as
criteria for a filmmaker's daring
and perceptiveness. The film, the
first in a series sponsored by the
Volunteers in Asia committee,
will be screened in Cubberley on
Friday at 7:30 and 9:30.
Any literary attempt to
encapsule Breathless could not
convey the sense of discovery, the
character of the American
gangster Gallicized and the tone
of Godard's stainless-steel yet
earthy Paris. This film is unique
among Godard's efforts in that
even those not attuned to the
director's vision and politics can
appreciate and enjoy his work
here. Highly recommended both
as a single film and as an easy
introduction to Godard. At
Tresidder on Friday.
Much of the gangster-oriented
heritage of Rreathless has its roots
in The Maltese Falcon, which is
not only the best private detective
film ever made but is also John
Huston's best (and first) picture
and offers Bogart in, if not his
best, his most characteristic role.
As Sam Spade, Bogie expresses
the essence of Hollywood's
tough-guy cynicism and is
uncannily complimented by Peter
Lorre, Sidney Greenstreet, Elisha
Cook, Jr. and Mary Astor.
Saturday at Tresidder.
The Sunday night flick is
Yellow Submarine and if the
entire audience at Mem Aud isn't

spaced out before the film begins,
it scertainly will be by the time
the triumphant ?epperlanders sing
"All You Need Is Love" as the
finale. Viewed in any condition,
this progressive animated feature
remains an incredible display of
artistic imagination and a
remarkable visualization of Beatle
sounds.
A new series of past and
current experimental films will
begin next Monday at 9 p.m. in
the auditorium of the new art
building. Un Chien Andalou,
devised in 1928 by Luis Bunuel
and Salvador Dali, bears up under
repeated viewings as a fascinating
perversity. Bruce Conner's A
Movie is, in my humble opinion,
one of the greatest films of
all-time, encompassing in its few
short minutes all the attractions,
be they corrupt or meritorious,
that "the movies" hold for
audiences everywhere.
Also being shown are two
surrealistic experiments by
Dodaist Man Ray, Return to
Reason (shot in one day) and
Emak Babia (which means, in
Basque, "leave me alone"). The
accompanying shorts are Norman
McLaren's trick film, Neighbors
(1952), the satiric The Life and
Death of 9413—A Hollywood
Extra, which was photographed in
1928 by Gregg Toland (Citizen
Kane), and three "news" films by
Berkeleyite Bruce Baillie,
Everyman, Mr. Hayashi, and News
no. 3.
