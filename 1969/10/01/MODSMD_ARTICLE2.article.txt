# Faculty To Reconsider
## Research Ban To End? 
### PATRICK McMAHON 
The entire faculty will review
two Academic Senate decisions on
classified research and the
University's foreign language
requirement at the* first regular
meeting of the Academic Council
Friday.
The April 24 decision of the
Academic Senate adopting new
research policy guidelines banning
secret research has been
petitioned for review to the
faculty by 85 professors.
The petition, noting the "grave
consequences for the University"
in adopting the ban, calls for a
mail ballot of the faculty on
whether or not that ban should be
rescinded.
The Daily learned yesterday
however that Prof. Robert Moffat
of mechanical engineering, a
signer of the petition, plans to
introduce a substitute resolution.
"Changed Climate"
He said yesterday he will ask
that the Committee on Research
begin its annual policy review this
quarter rather than in the spring.
"The problem of classified
research on this campus no longer
exists. There has been a changed
research climate since the April 24
decision," Moffat said. He cited

that there are no longer any
classified projects on campus.
He would like to see a more
"workable" policy in light of the
changed climate. He declined
however to suggest ways in which
the policy might be altered,
leaving that to the committee.
Support Anticipated
Moffat's motion is expected to
have wide support among the
petitioners, as well as other
faculty members.
Fifty-one professors have also
asked for a review of the
Academic Senate's action on May
8, rejecting a University language
requirement.
At that time, the Senate
rejected by a vote of 23 to 12 the
following University graduation
requirement:
"Demonstration by candidates
for the 8.A., as early as
possible—preferably upon
entrance, but normally not later
than the end of the sophomore
year—of proficiency in a foreign
language, in a manner and at a
level to be determined by the
appropriate Committee on
Undergraduate Studies."
Humanities May Suffer
The petition asks that the
entire faculty vote on the above

requirement, suggesting that if it
did not pass it would have "a
far-reaching effect upon the study
of Humanities at Stanford."
Until such time as the new
language requirement is approved
and acted upon or rejected by
faculty, the present general
studies requirement concerning
languages will be in effect.
The proposed new requirement
will mean a substantial change
from the present requirement.
Presently students may choose a
mathematics or a language series.
Students Already Prepared
Prof. John Lapp of French and
Italian, a signer of the petition,
pointed out that "more and more
students are meeting the
proficiency requirement at
entrance."
Lapp also expressed concern
that high schools might slack off
in their language training. "If
Stanford University said we have
no language requirement, high
school might begin to drop some
of their courses."
Shea Suggests Otherwise
Patrick Shea of the ASSU
Council of Presidents suggested
however that the review of the
language requirement was simply
intended to preserve "the vested
interests of a few faculty,"
specifically the language
departments.
He also pointed out that in
adopting this requirement
unilaterally, the faculty "would
be throwing the delicate process
of community decision-making
out the window," referring to the
joint sessions last spring of the
Student Education Council and
Academic Senate.
It was also pointed out that
there was no effect on the
humanities at Yale when it
reduced languages to a "highly
recommended" rather than
"required" status.
Any decision of the Academic
Senate is subject to a review by
the all-faculty Academic Council
upon a petition from 50
professors.
All faculty members of
assistant professor rank or above
are members of the Academic
Council.


INSTRUCTOR RETURNS—MicheI Langikiieux, former drama instructor,
returned to Stanford during the summer and discovered that three grades he had
given last spring quarter were changed from F's to B'S on his final grade lists,
filed with the Registrar's office.
