# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Jazz Classics 
### TERRY RUSTIN 
One of the most exciting and
versatile musical groups in today's
jazz scene is being presented by
Stanford's Public Events people
this week. Friday evening at 8:30
in Memorial Auditorium the
Modern Jazz Quartet will present
a sequel to their Monterey Jazz
Festival concert with the Los
Angeles String Quartet, and it
promises to be an interesting
musical evening.
The Modern Jazz Quartet,
known throughout the world as
one of the most creative
innovators of jazz style, was
founded fourteen years ago by the
same four men who will be here
Friday evening. The result of this
long association has been a group
which plays together as one man
with four instruments.
The ultimate of an
extemporanious art form such as
jazz would be a musical
understanding among the
members so strong lhat nothing
written would ever be needed to
guide the performers. Perhaps two
or three groups today have this
powerful of a rapport—and the
MJQ is the leader.
J a/.x-Classical
The MJQ was one of the first
jazz organizations to experiment
with j a z z - a n d - c 1 a ss i c a 1
combinations. They have
performed with several symphony
orchestras and numerous smaller
groups since their first experiment
in 1961 with Max Rudolf and the
Cincinnati Symphony. The
Quartet has learned much since
that first night, especially in
ironing out the problems
presented by the differences in
tone and inflection between the
basically European character of
classical performance and the
African and American
combination that makes up jazz.
Playing with the MJQ will be
another group known to be more
daring than its peers. The Los
Angeles String Quartet is young
and progressing, and has lately
developed an interest in jazz. 1 am
still somewhat dubious of the
place of classical strings in jazz
music, but the LASQ has
impressed me with their efforts.
For a purely classical

performance, the Los Angeles
Quartet is very good, and they
will be playing Bartok's Quartet
No. 3 as their solo part of the bill.
It is a demanding work, very
expressive and a real job when
well-played, as I expect it will be.
On The Program
The Friday night show begins
with nine numbers by the MJQ,
highlighted by "A Visitor from
Mars," one of the best numbers
played at Monterey. Jazz fans will
want to come to hear this set.
Then the L.A. String Quartet
plays Bartok; appreciators of
classical music will be tempted to
this part. Finally, the two groups
will play together, works written
especially for the MJQ in classical
concert and others arranged by
John Lewis, the MJQ's versatile
and imaginative pianist. And this
entices both of us.

One of the most exciting and
versatile musical groups in today's
jazz scene is being presented by
Stanford's Public Events people
this week. Friday evening at 8:30
in Memorial Auditorium the
Modern Jazz Quartet will present
a sequel to their Monterey Jazz
Festival concert with the Los
Angeles String Quartet, and it
promises to be an interesting
musical evening.
The Modern Jazz Quartet,
known throughout the world as
one of the most creative
innovators of jazz style, was
founded fourteen years ago by the
same four men who will be here
Friday evening. The result of this
long association has been a group
which plays together as one man
with four instruments.
The ultimate of an
extemporanious art form such as
jazz would be a musical
understanding among the
members so strong lhat nothing
written would ever be needed to
guide the performers. Perhaps two
or three groups today have this
powerful of a rapport—and the
MJQ is the leader.
J a/.x-Classical
The MJQ was one of the first
jazz organizations to experiment
with j a z z - a n d - c 1 a ss i c a 1
combinations. They have
performed with several symphony
orchestras and numerous smaller
groups since their first experiment
in 1961 with Max Rudolf and the
Cincinnati Symphony. The
Quartet has learned much since
that first night, especially in
ironing out the problems
presented by the differences in
tone and inflection between the
basically European character of
classical performance and the
African and American
combination that makes up jazz.
Playing with the MJQ will be
another group known to be more
daring than its peers. The Los
Angeles String Quartet is young
and progressing, and has lately
developed an interest in jazz. 1 am
still somewhat dubious of the
place of classical strings in jazz
music, but the LASQ has
impressed me with their efforts.
For a purely classical

performance, the Los Angeles
Quartet is very good, and they
will be playing Bartok's Quartet
No. 3 as their solo part of the bill.
It is a demanding work, very
expressive and a real job when
well-played, as I expect it will be.
On The Program
The Friday night show begins
with nine numbers by the MJQ,
highlighted by "A Visitor from
Mars," one of the best numbers
played at Monterey. Jazz fans will
want to come to hear this set.
Then the L.A. String Quartet
plays Bartok; appreciators of
classical music will be tempted to
this part. Finally, the two groups
will play together, works written
especially for the MJQ in classical
concert and others arranged by
John Lewis, the MJQ's versatile
and imaginative pianist. And this
entices both of us.
