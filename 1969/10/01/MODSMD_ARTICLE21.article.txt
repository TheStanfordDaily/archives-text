# Doubled Up
## Always Trust Your Partner 
### Marshall Schwartz 
The moral of this hand is trust
your partner, even if he's just
kidding around. It was played last
Thursday night at the weekly
duplicate game at the Veterans
Building in Palo Alto.
The first two bids are
straightforward enough, but the 1
D overcall needs some
explanation. It is obviously a
psychic bid—South looked a little
too eager after his partner opened,
and East decided to try to throw a
monkey wrench into the
proceedings. Even though his side
had favorable vulnerability, 1 D
was about as much as he could
dare—and, after all, it was his best
suit.
He almost succeeded in his
effort—and would have if his
partner had listened to him.
After East's strange overcall,
bidding proceeded normally.
After North showed a
better-than-average opener with
his 2 S rebid, South naturally
pushed to game. West hesitated
slightly, however, after the 3NT
bid. He held 10 points, and after
an opening, an overcall, and a
game bid, he knew someone had
to be lying—undoubtedly his
partner. On this count, he was
correct. Unfortunately, he also
refused to believe his partner had
anything worthwhile in the suit he
had bid, diamonds.
With a low diamond lead,
declarer will either cover East's 10
with his queen or take the king
with his ace (let's assume the
latter happens—the situations are
equivalent.) Declarer's best play
now is to set up the club suit. He
first cashes the spade king to
unblock, and then leads a low
club. West must put in his
singleton 10, and declarer, with
only one remaining entry to
dummy—that being in clubs—must
let him hold the trick, playing for
a 3-2 break in the suit.

West cannot now continue a
diamond, because proper play by
declarer would let him take four
tricks in the suit, and give him the
timing to set up a heart trick, to
go with two spades and two clubs
for his contract. Declarer merely
allows West to win the defense's
one diamond trick, thereby
preventing the club lead that
severs communications with
dummy.
All West hais to do now is cash
his two high hearts—leaving
dummy with only the black suits,
and lead spade. He must be
careful to unblock, however,
throwing his queen under
dummy's ace, to avoid an
endplay. Otherwise declarer will
finesse the jack of spades, cash the
ace and two good clubs, and
throw West in with the queen.
Meanwhile, declarer has come
down to only red suit winners in
his hand, and West must lead to
him. With unblocking, East will be
able to win the spade and safely
lead the club queen to dummy,
later taking the fifty and setting
trick with his jack of clubs.
But this is not the way the
defense went. In practice, West

led a low heart. This was
questionable, because
North-South were playing
negative doubles, and the heart
bid promised at least a five-card
suit (he would double for takeout
with only four). A low heart was
played from dummy, and East's
10 was taken with the queen. A
low club was played, West's 10
allowed to hold.
West now compounded his
errors by cashing the heart ace
and continuing the spade nine.
Declarer took the hook, and
played the ace, king and another
club. West continued his erring
ways by pitching one heart on the
clubs. Now, when East, in with a
club, led a diamond, declarer
finessed, forced out the heart
king, and claimed the rest. He lost
only two hearts and two clubs.
The value of the diamond lead
is that it cuts declarer's
communication with dummy
early. After the spade king is
cashed, West has only to take his
top hearts, and there is no way to
get from one hand to the other.

equivalent.) Declarer's best play
now is to set up the club suit. He
first cashes the spade king to
unblock, and then leads a low
club. West must put in his
singleton 10, and declarer, with
only one remaining entry to
dummy—that being in clubs—must
let him hold the trick, playing for
a 3-2 break in the suit.

The bidding:

Pass 1 C ID 1 H

Vul: N-S Opening Lead: Heart 3
West cannot now continue a
diamond, because proper play by
declarer would let him take four
tricks in the suit, and give him the
timing to set up a heart trick, to
go with two spades and two clubs
for his contract. Declarer merely
allows West to win the defense's
one diamond trick, thereby
preventing the club lead that
severs communications with
dummy.
All West hais to do now is cash
his two high hearts—leaving
dummy with only the black suits,
and lead spade. He must be
careful to unblock, however,
throwing his queen under
dummy's ace, to avoid an
endplay. Otherwise declarer will
finesse the jack of spades, cash the
ace and two good clubs, and
throw West in with the queen.
Meanwhile, declarer has come
down to only red suit winners in
his hand, and West must lead to
him. With unblocking, East will be
able to win the spade and safely
lead the club queen to dummy,
later taking the fifty and setting
trick with his jack of clubs.
But this is not the way the
defense went. In practice, West

led a low heart. This was
questionable, because
North-South were playing
negative doubles, and the heart
bid promised at least a five-card
suit (he would double for takeout
with only four). A low heart was
played from dummy, and East's
10 was taken with the queen. A
low club was played, West's 10
allowed to hold.
West now compounded his
errors by cashing the heart ace
and continuing the spade nine.
Declarer took the hook, and
played the ace, king and another
club. West continued his erring
ways by pitching one heart on the
clubs. Now, when East, in with a
club, led a diamond, declarer
finessed, forced out the heart
king, and claimed the rest. He lost
only two hearts and two clubs.
The value of the diamond lead
is that it cuts declarer's
communication with dummy
early. After the spade king is
cashed, West has only to take his
top hearts, and there is no way to
get from one hand to the other.

For those of you new to
Stanford, there is a duplicate
game on campus every Tuesday
night at 7:15 in the Lower
Lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse (part of the Old
Union). Don't worry if you've
never played duplicate
before—you'll have company.
John and Miriam White, who run
the game, provide an easy
introduction to duplicate bridge.
The moral of this hand is trust
your partner, even if he's just
kidding around. It was played last
Thursday night at the weekly
duplicate game at the Veterans
Building in Palo Alto.
The first two bids are
straightforward enough, but the 1
D overcall needs some
explanation. It is obviously a
psychic bid—South looked a little
too eager after his partner opened,
and East decided to try to throw a
monkey wrench into the
proceedings. Even though his side
had favorable vulnerability, 1 D
was about as much as he could
dare—and, after all, it was his best
suit.
He almost succeeded in his
effort—and would have if his
partner had listened to him.
After East's strange overcall,
bidding proceeded normally.
After North showed a
better-than-average opener with
his 2 S rebid, South naturally
pushed to game. West hesitated
slightly, however, after the 3NT
bid. He held 10 points, and after
an opening, an overcall, and a
game bid, he knew someone had
to be lying—undoubtedly his
partner. On this count, he was
correct. Unfortunately, he also
refused to believe his partner had
anything worthwhile in the suit he
had bid, diamonds.
With a low diamond lead,
declarer will either cover East's 10
with his queen or take the king

latter happens—the situations are

and lead spade. He must be
careful to unblock, however,
throwing his queen under
dummy's ace, to avoid an
endplay. Otherwise declarer will
finesse the jack of spades, cash the
ace and two good clubs, and
throw West in with the queen.
Meanwhile, declarer has come
down to only red suit winners in
his hand, and West must lead to
him. With unblocking, East will be
able to win the spade and safely
lead the club queen to dummy,
later taking the fifty and setting
trick with his jack of clubs.
But this is not the way the
defense went. In practice, West

led a low heart. This was
questionable, because
North-South were playing
negative doubles, and the heart
bid promised at least a five-card
suit (he would double for takeout
with only four). A low heart was
played from dummy, and East's
10 was taken with the queen. A
low club was played, West's 10
allowed to hold.
West now compounded his
errors by cashing the heart ace
and continuing the spade nine.
Declarer took the hook, and
played the ace, king and another
club. West continued his erring
ways by pitching one heart on the
clubs. Now, when East, in with a
club, led a diamond, declarer
finessed, forced out the heart
king, and claimed the rest. He lost
only two hearts and two clubs.
The value of the diamond lead
is that it cuts declarer's
communication with dummy
early. After the spade king is
cashed, West has only to take his
top hearts, and there is no way to
get from one hand to the other.
Trust your partner.

For those of you new to
Stanford, there is a duplicate
game on campus every Tuesday
night at 7:15 in the Lower
Lounge of the Women's
Clubhouse (part of the Old
Union). Don't worry if you've
never played duplicate
before—you'll have company.
John and Miriam White, who run
the game, provide an easy
introduction to duplicate bridge.
The moral of this hand is trust
your partner, even if he's just
kidding around. It was played last
Thursday night at the weekly
duplicate game at the Veterans
Building in Palo Alto.
The first two bids are
straightforward enough, but the 1
D overcall needs some
explanation. It is obviously a
psychic bid—South looked a little
too eager after his partner opened,
and East decided to try to throw a
monkey wrench into the
proceedings. Even though his side
had favorable vulnerability, 1 D
was about as much as he could
dare—and, after all, it was his best
suit.
He almost succeeded in his
effort—and would have if his
partner had listened to him.
After East's strange overcall,
bidding proceeded normally.
After North showed a
better-than-average opener with
his 2 S rebid, South naturally
pushed to game. West hesitated
slightly, however, after the 3NT
bid. He held 10 points, and after
an opening, an overcall, and a
game bid, he knew someone had
to be lying—undoubtedly his
partner. On this count, he was
correct. Unfortunately, he also
refused to believe his partner had
anything worthwhile in the suit he
had bid, diamonds.
With a low diamond lead,
declarer will either cover East's 10
with his queen or take the king
with his ace (let's assume the
latter happens—the situations are
equivalent.) Declarer's best play
now is to set up the club suit. He
first cashes the spade king to
unblock, and then leads a low
club. West must put in his
singleton 10, and declarer, with
only one remaining entry to
dummy—that being in clubs—must
let him hold the trick, playing for
a 3-2 break in the suit.

The bidding:
WEST NORTH EAST SOUTH
Pass 1 C ID 1 H
2D 2 S Pass 3 NT
Pass Pass Pass
Vul: N-S Opening Lead: Heart 3
West cannot now continue a
diamond, because proper play by
declarer would let him take four
tricks in the suit, and give him the
timing to set up a heart trick, to
go with two spades and two clubs
for his contract. Declarer merely
allows West to win the defense's
one diamond trick, thereby
preventing the club lead that
severs communications with
dummy.
All West hais to do now is cash
his two high hearts—leaving
dummy with only the black suits,
and lead spade. He must be
careful to unblock, however,
throwing his queen under
dummy's ace, to avoid an
endplay. Otherwise declarer will
