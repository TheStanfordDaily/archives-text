# Last Pre-Reg Panel
## Students Denounce 'System' 
### BILL FREIVOGEL 
An administrator, a professor
and three students probed the
question "Is Change Possible
Within The System?" yesterday in
the last of the freshman
orientation panels.
ASSU Co-President Barry
Askinas, Radical Libertarian Bill
Evers, and David Jones, head of
the Committee For A New
Politics, presented liberal to
radical positions on how to bring
about change. But, all agreed that
students can not change the
university solely by working
within established structures.
In answering the student
complaints, history professor
Philip Dawson and Dean of
Students Peter Bulkeley
advocated cautious change. Both
thought "the system" adequate to
accommodate that kind of
alteration.
Askinas opened the discussion
saying, "I'm quite pessimistic
about working through the
system, but not about working
with it."
"The way we have changed the
university has been by applying
pressure. Each time change has
been desired, it has been brought
about by going outside the system
or by making threats to do that."

To illustrate his point Askinas
maintained that in the past
meaningful reforms such as the
termination of secret research,
and the acquisition of better food
and higher teaching assistant
salaries have come only after
action "outside the system."
Reason Not Sufficient
"Being reasonable is not
sufficient. The university only
seems to answer to
confrontation," he concluded.
Evers went one step further.
"Change is possible through the
system; but not the kind of
change we want. That's because
reform is the enemy of
meaningful change."
He then proceded to describe
the anarchistic view of the world.
"A nation-state is an entity that
tries to exert a monopoly of force
and violence in a particular area."
"Because of this there are
always people who gravitate to
the power of manipulating this
force. What I want is a free people
combining in voluntary
associations."
Government In Education
Turning to the university Evers
asserted, "Because the
government pays for education,
that education is directed along
the lines of governmental interest.

We see the effects of the
military-industrial complex that
rules this country in the
university."
The third student, David Jones,
decried the lack of direction in
university reform. "We get
change, but we don't get
direction. This year the university
is going to have to define what the
purpose of the university is."
Jones had his own suggestions
of what this purpose should be.
He advocated three
goalsâ€”relevancy in education,
education directed at meaningful
change, and consensual
community decision-making.
Guarded Optimism
While the students were
pessimistic, Dawson and Bulkeley
expressed guarded optimism in
"the system."
Bulkeley said, "The university
wants to respond more to student
needs, though it has too often not
responded inadequately. Still, one
must be cautious. Disclosing the
need for change does not always
render a cure; but it always brings
with it the expectation of a cure."
Dawson also emphasized the
need for caution. "The university
is made up of a vast diversity of
people. That's why we must have
consensual decision-making," he
said.



Tryouts are busily underway lor
"The Carnival Down lielow," this
