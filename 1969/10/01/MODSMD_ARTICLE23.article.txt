The first components of an
automated geophysical
observatory for the Antarctic,
being built by a team of Stanford
University engineering students
and faculty, will be installed near
Byrd Station by the end of the
year.
A six-foot-high, cylindrical
aluminum "capsule" to house
instruments, its six-foot dish
antenna, and a tubular pyramidal
mount to hold it 15 feet above
ground will be emplaced in
December when the Antarctic
summer begins, said John
Katsufrakis, project leader and a
research engineer in the
Radioscience Lab.
The project is supported by
National Science Foundation
grants totaling $90,000.
Co-investigators heading the study
are electrical engineering Profs.
Robert A. HelHwell and Bruce
Lusignan, together with Prof.
Peter Z. Bulkeley of the
Mechanical Engineering Design
Division.
Still very much in the
design-and-development stage, the
first installation near Byrd Station
will test the apparatus' ability to
stand up under the stiff, buffeting
winds which gust up to 100
m.p.h.
Their primary reason for being
there, said Katsufrakis, will be to
conduct research on
very-low-frequency phenomena in
the magnetosphere for Prof.
Helliwell.
Should these and future tests
prove the feasibility of unmanned
observatories, many of them
could be emplaced in Antarctic
outposts to gather information
continuously on such phenomena
as ionospheric disturbances,
auroral displays, weather, cosmic
rays, and geomagnetism.
The information would be
telemetered to synchronous
satellites hovering above the
Atlantic and Pacific Oceans,
which would relay it in turn to
receiving stations in the U.S. The
stations would sort out the data
and send it on to the individual
scientists involved.
Electric power this year will
come from a line to Byrd Station
only a mile away. Next year the
observatory probably will have its
own 100-watt battery supply
continuously charged by a
windmill. Future observatories
may use radioisotope-fueled
generators or windmill battery
chargers.
