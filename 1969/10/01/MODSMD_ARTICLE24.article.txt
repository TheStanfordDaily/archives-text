# $1 Million
## Law School Gift 
### 
The Stanford Law School has
received more than $1 million
from Frederick I. Richman, a
Laguna Beach attorney and land
developer, towards construction
of its new $9 million building.
The gift is one of the largest
ever received by the School from
a living individual and provides a
major boost to its current
fund-raising campaign, the Agenda
for Legal Education.
Richman took his A.B. in
pre-legal studies at Stanford,
receiving his degree in 1927.
In 1928, he received his J.D.
from the School, which he has
supported through a student loan
fund and other gifts. He is a
member of the Board of Trustees
of Claremont Men's College,
where he has endowed a
professorship in philosophy. He is
also a member of the Board of
Overseers of the Associated
Colleges of Claremont.
Richman's gift provides a
substantial boost to the Law
School's Agenda for Legal
Education program, a campaign to
acquire basic funding for the
School's programs. The
construction of a new building is

one of the goals of the Agenda
along with library development,
an adequate research program,
financial aid to students, the
acquisition of supplementary
faculty and support of
student-run extracurricular
activities.
Ground will be broken on the
building sometime late this year.
Depending upon financing,
occupancy is tentatively
scheduled for the winter of 1971.
The project will cost about $9
million, of which the University
has about $2 million from the
PACE effort and $65,000 from
contributions. Expected
government money from the
Department of Health, Education
and Welfare, under Title 111 of the
Higher Education Facilities Act,
will be cut back, or perhaps
eliminated.
The University has
commissioned the San Francisco
office of Skidmore, Owings and
Merrill, architects. A portion of
the completed building will bear
an appropriate reference to
Richman. At his request, his
initials F.I.R. will be used,
suggesting a counterpart to the
famed Palo Alto tree.
