# Club To Teach Karate Technique
## 
### LARRY BUTLER 
Members of the Stanford
community can receive
instruction in the oriental art of
kenpo karate beginning Thursday
at 7:00 p.m. in the Old Pavilion
when the Stanford Karate Club
will offer a demonstration.
All men and women of the
Stanford community are invited
to join the Karate Club which
meets every Tuesday and
Thursday evenings from 7:00 to
8:30 p.m. in the Men's Gym.
Private lessons are available at no
charge.
P.E. credit is available by
signing up for P.E. 35.
This fall marks the sixth year
of both karate instruction and
tournament competition for the
Karate Club. Instruction for men
and women at the beginning,
intermediate, and advanced levels
will be given by several of the Bay
Area's finest karateists.
The instructional program will
consist of training in fundamental
blocks, punches, kicks, and other
offensive and defensive
techniques. The next step will be
to put these fundamentals into a
series of moves which are called
self-defense techniques. These will
enable the student of karate of

defend himself against any attack.
The student develops a mental
calmness in the face of danger in
addition to co-ordination, agility,
and balance. The club also teaches
forms or "kata," which are
dance-like sequences of
predetermined maneuvers.
The student may then learn
free-style sparring, which is close
to an actual street situation. The
offensive and defensive
maneuvers, such as kicks,
punches, and chops, are pulled
short of contact so that they
prevent injury but still afford a
realistic situation.
As a student becomes more
adept at maneuvers, he is
promoted in rank. With sufficient
knowledge he will be able to enter
the Karate Club competition team
which participates in at least six
tournaments each year. All
members of the competition team
are eligible to receive the Stanford
Varsity Award if they satisfy the
basic requirements to be outlined
at Thursday's demonstration.
The Karate Club is a member
of the International Kenpo Karate
Association and the Chinese
Karate Association, and all their
promotions in rank are
internationally recognized.
