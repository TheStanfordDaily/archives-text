# Meal Associates Applications Due
## 
### 
The Dean of Student's office
has announced the procedure for
applying for Meal Associate status
in the residence halls.
Applications will be available
through Susan Patterson in the
Dean of Students Office.
When the student gets the
application, Susan Patterson can
inform him which houses are open
for associates and any restrictions
that an individual house may
impose such as interest in a
particular project, etc.
The student should fill out the
application and take it to the
residence hall where he wishes to
associate. There the director's
office can inform him if he must
talk to someone, in other words,
the exact procedure for that
specific house.
In all cases the student should
have a definite response whether
he may be an associate within
three days. The selection
procedure must not be a method
of comparison but rather one of
determining the student's
willingness to eat in that
particular residence and of
informing him how best to begin
participating in the house
functions.
If the student is accepted- he
receives a student bill from the

residence hall secretary for the
amount of the meals he will eat.
He takes that bill to registration
or the Food Service in Encina to
have his picture meal card made.
The Food Service will not
permit anyone to have a ticket
made until he presents this bill.
If it is more satisfactory to have
a person in the area's food service
to type the bill that can be
determined at the local area.
However, only one person should
type the bills so that it can be
assured that the associates are
coordinated.
Those students who have
already applied to be Meal
Associates should check with the
residence directors in the house to
which they applied for
confirmation or rejection of their
applications.
