# Low Frosh Turnout Invalidates Survey
## 
### 
Only 15% of the freshman class
completed the American Council
on Education (ACE)
questionnaire during the two days
it was administered this week.
Counseling and Testing Service
Director John Black declared that
the number who took the test
"was not quite large enough for
significant results since it was not
a random sample. Since it was
only a sample of volunteers, it
probably won't be very useful."
The test, which included
questions pertaining to

participation in demonstrations
and experimentation with alcohol,
tobacco, and drugs, was
denounced by members of the
Students for a Democratic Society
(SDS) as an attempt to eliminate
radical students.
Black attributed the poor
turnout to apathy rather than
student protest. He invited any
freshmen who have not already
filled out the demographic survey
to do so any day this week from 8
a.m. to 5 p.m. at the Counseling
and Testing Center, 306 Old
Union.
