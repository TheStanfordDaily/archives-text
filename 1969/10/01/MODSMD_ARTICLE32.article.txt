# Oregon State
## Scouting Report 
### FRED MANN (Second in a six part series) 
Racked by racial tension and
team troubles during the
off-season, the Oregon State
University Beavers are a total
question mark this grid season.
The jolly Great Pumpkin,
Coach Dee Andros, happened to
run into black linebacker Fred
Milton during the winter, and
from the result, he probably
wishes he hadn't. Milton sported a
beard, and Andros told him to
shave it off. He was under athletic
scholarship, and the football rules
applied all year round, Milton was
told.
The facial hairs became the
most famous since Joe Namath's
mustache. Milton called it a
"denial of my cultural rights,"

and said no to the razor demand.
He was off the team. The handful
of blacks at OSU boycotted
classes, and the black athletes quit
in protest. Andros was branded a
racist, and was on the firing line.
Black athletes from other schools
refused to play against the
Beavers. Andros was supported by
the students, and finally, the
controversy died down. Spring
practice began (minus Milton and
a number of other blacks).
Today, Oregon State is still not
a team. Only two black football
players remain, and dissention is
still a problem. For a team that
needs all the help it can get this
season, unhappiness is an extra
heavy burden. The Beavers lost
Bill Enyart, John Didion, and
Steve Preece, and all they have
left are fullback Billy Main, a sure
All-American, the great coaching
talent of Andros, and new
Astro-Turf.
In their first test of the year,
UCLA destroyed them, 37-0. OSU
didn't complete a pass until the
final quarter, and looked like a
high school team. The next week,
they took apart lowa, 42-14.
Untested at quarterback, the
offense is inconsistent. The
offensive line appeared very weak
in the opener, and could spring
the amazing Main only once.
When Steve Endicott's passing
picks up, and Main finds some
holes, OSU can score.
Defensively, the line is the
team's strength. Big Jess Lewis,
230, and Bill Nelson, 260, form a
strong nucleus, and the
linebacking is adequate. Pass
coverage is extremely weak, but
with experience, the backs should
tighten up. Overall, it's a building
year for the Beavers, but they
could spoil a few title bids. They
are unpredictable, therefore:
Predicted finish: 6th place.

season, unhappiness is an extra
heavy burden. The Beavers lost
Bill Enyart, John Didion, and
Steve Preece, and all they have
left are fullback Billy Main, a sure
All-American, the great coaching
talent of Andros, and new
Astro-Turf.
In their first test of the year,
UCLA destroyed them, 37-0. OSU
didn't complete a pass until the
final quarter, and looked like a
high school team. The next week,
they took apart lowa, 42-14.
Untested at quarterback, the
offense is inconsistent. The
offensive line appeared very weak
in the opener, and could spring
the amazing Main only once.
When Steve Endicott's passing
picks up, and Main finds some
holes, OSU can score.
Defensively, the line is the
team's strength. Big Jess Lewis,
230, and Bill Nelson, 260, form a
strong nucleus, and the
linebacking is adequate. Pass
coverage is extremely weak, but
with experience, the backs should
tighten up. Overall, it's a building
year for the Beavers, but they
could spoil a few title bids. They
are unpredictable, therefore:
Predicted finish: 6th place.
Racked by racial tension and
team troubles during the
off-season, the Oregon State
University Beavers are a total
question mark this grid season.
The jolly Great Pumpkin,
Coach Dee Andros, happened to
run into black linebacker Fred
Milton during the winter, and
from the result, he probably
wishes he hadn't. Milton sported a
beard, and Andros told him to
shave it off. He was under athletic
scholarship, and the football rules
applied all year round, Milton was
told.
The facial hairs became the
most famous since Joe Namath's
mustache. Milton called it a
"denial of my cultural rights,"

and said no to the razor demand.
He was off the team. The handful
of blacks at OSU boycotted
classes, and the black athletes quit
in protest. Andros was branded a
racist, and was on the firing line.
Black athletes from other schools
refused to play against the
Beavers. Andros was supported by
the students, and finally, the
controversy died down. Spring
practice began (minus Milton and
a number of other blacks).
Today, Oregon State is still not
a team. Only two black football
players remain, and dissention is
still a problem. For a team that
needs all the help it can get this
season, unhappiness is an extra
heavy burden. The Beavers lost
Bill Enyart, John Didion, and
Steve Preece, and all they have
