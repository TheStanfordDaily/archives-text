More than 30 recent water
colors and drawings in mixed
media by Prof. Daniel M.
Mendelowitz are being shown at
Stanford Art Gallery until Oct.
26.
Prof. Mendelowitz, a 1926
Stanford graduate, has been on
the art faculty since 1934. He is
now beginning his last teaching
year before retirement next
September.
This exhibition continues the
artist-teacher's tradition of
expressing a central feeling of
tenderness and respect for what
he sees.
The exhibit includes four
watercolors which he did this
summer at Waldron Island in the
San Juan group.
The show also includes some
new weed paintings and drawings.
Weeds as subjects were great
favorites in Prof. Mendelowitz's
1 967 Stanford one-man
exhibition.
The writing of his new book
"Drawing" re-established Prof.
Mendelowitz's long-standing
interest in drawing, an interest
that culminates in a number of
the pencil studies featured in the
up-coming exhibition.
There are lonely landscapes,
scenes of the Foothills, the Bay,
and —of course —the mud flats.
There are a few familiar and loved
stormy skies and trees.
''The Farm: Vision to
Reality," an exhibit of
photographs and charts showing
the growth of Stanford, is now on
display in the Tresidder Union
gallery.
The show includes about 30
photos and architectural plans of
Stanford buildings, the earliest
dated 1886. Photos on display
include ones of buildings before
and after the 1906 earthquake,
the Stanford home and plans for
structures never built.
The show is sponsored by the
Cultural Arts Division of
Tresidder and will be the only
display through Oct. 9. Persons
interested in joining the division
to plan future exhibits are asked
to contact Helen Shannon, ext.
4311.
