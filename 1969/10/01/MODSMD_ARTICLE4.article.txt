## Stokes Wins Mayoral Primary 
### 
CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP)—Carl
B. Stokes, first Negro mayor of a
major American city, won
renomination Tuesday night in a
Democratic mayoral primary
election battle with white law and
order candidate Robert J. Kelly.
Stokes, battling for a chance at
a second two-year term as
Cleveland mayor, erased a deficit
of more than 20,000 votes as the
first major returns came in from
the city's black areas.
With 850 of Cleveland's 973
polling places reporting, Stokes
held 72,971 to Kelly's 57,511.
The returns accounted for
130,482 votes of an estimated
145,000 total and election
officials said all remaining were
black areas certain to choose
Stokes.
The victory pits Stokes, who
had waged an almost leisurely
campaign against Kelly, in line for
a much tougher Nov. 4 contest
against popular Republican Ralph
J. Perk.
Stokes, 42, became the first
elected Negro mayor of a major
U.S. city in 1967. This year he ran
a low-key primary campaign,
citing what he said were his
administration's advances in

housing, jobs and pollution
control.
Kelly, 48, is a former Cleveland
service director but never before
ran for public office.
Reagan
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Gov.
Reagan, disagreeing with President
Nixon, opposed Tuesday the
House-passed measure providing
for direct election of the
president.
"To go to direct presidential
elections would be the greatest
blow to our sovereign states that
has been made for a long time."
His statement could signal
trouble ahead in California for the
proposed constitutional
amendment abolishing the
electoral college and giving the
presidential election to the
candidate receiving the largest
popular vote. If nobody got 40
percent of the vote, there would
be a run-off.
The Republican President
announced his support of the plan
earlier in the day.
As for his own political plans,
Reagan was less direct. He
declines to say when he would

announce whether he would run
for a second term—or even if he
has decided to make the race.
He was asked if he had made a
decision.
"I haven't and I'm not prepared
to make any statement," he
replied.
Reagan's advisers and friends
predict he will run next year.

WASHINGTON
(AP) —Secretary of Defense Melvin
R. Laird got a cool reception
Tuesday when he tried to
persuade Congress that a draft
lottery is the fairest way to let
young men know their callup
prospects.
Rep. F. Edward Hebert, D-La.,
chairman of a special House
subcommittee hearing on
President Nixon's proposal, said
the difference between the lottery
and a plan the President could
establish without congressional
approval is "tweedledum and
tweedle dee."
The lottery plan would still
leave most young men guessing as
to just when they might be called,
Hebert said.

Intercept
SACRAMENTO (AP)--Gov.
Reagan pledged full support
Tuesday to the tough "Operation
Intercept" at the Mexican border,
calling drug abuse "an epidemic
that has infected Californians in
every walk of life."
The governor said there's no
question that the project has
caused hardship to tourists and
businessmen, but he said they
would just have to live with it.
"If this were an epidemic
disease that crippled and took the
lives of our youth, the economic
hardships and the inconvenience
to travelers would be considered
inconsequential by all thinking
Californians," he said.
Reagan described narcotics
addiction and use of dangerous
drugs "as damaging to this nation
and its future generations as any
disease spread by a germ."
"I fully support President
Nixon in this operation and
pledged to the federal government
our complete cooperation and
offered any assistance necessary."

CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP)—Carl
B. Stokes, first Negro mayor of a
major American city, won
renomination Tuesday night in a
Democratic mayoral primary
election battle with white law and
order candidate Robert J. Kelly.
Stokes, battling for a chance at
a second two-year term as
Cleveland mayor, erased a deficit
of more than 20,000 votes as the
first major returns came in from
the city's black areas.
With 850 of Cleveland's 973
polling places reporting, Stokes
held 72,971 to Kelly's 57,511.
The returns accounted for
130,482 votes of an estimated
145,000 total and election
officials said all remaining were
black areas certain to choose
Stokes.
The victory pits Stokes, who
had waged an almost leisurely
campaign against Kelly, in line for
a much tougher Nov. 4 contest
against popular Republican Ralph
J. Perk.
Stokes, 42, became the first
elected Negro mayor of a major
U.S. city in 1967. This year he ran
a low-key primary campaign,
citing what he said were his
administration's advances in

housing, jobs and pollution
control.
Kelly, 48, is a former Cleveland
service director but never before
ran for public office.
Reagan
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Gov.
Reagan, disagreeing with President

House-passed measure providing

"To go to direct presidential
elections would be the greatest
blow to our sovereign states that
has been made for a long time."
His statement could signal
trouble ahead in California for the
proposed constitutional
amendment abolishing the
electoral college and giving the
presidential election to the
candidate receiving the largest
popular vote. If nobody got 40
percent of the vote, there would
be a run-off.
The Republican President
announced his support of the plan
earlier in the day.
As for his own political plans,
Reagan was less direct. He
declines to say when he would

announce whether he would run
for a second term—or even if he
has decided to make the race.
He was asked if he had made a

"I haven't and I'm not prepared
to make any statement," he
replied.
Reagan's advisers and friends

CLEVELAND, Ohio (AP)—Carl
B. Stokes, first Negro mayor of a
major American city, won
renomination Tuesday night in a
Democratic mayoral primary
election battle with white law and
order candidate Robert J. Kelly.
Stokes, battling for a chance at
a second two-year term as
Cleveland mayor, erased a deficit
of more than 20,000 votes as the
first major returns came in from
the city's black areas.
With 850 of Cleveland's 973
polling places reporting, Stokes
held 72,971 to Kelly's 57,511.
The returns accounted for
130,482 votes of an estimated
145,000 total and election
officials said all remaining were
black areas certain to choose
Stokes.
The victory pits Stokes, who
had waged an almost leisurely
campaign against Kelly, in line for
a much tougher Nov. 4 contest
against popular Republican Ralph
J. Perk.
Stokes, 42, became the first
elected Negro mayor of a major
U.S. city in 1967. This year he ran
a low-key primary campaign,
citing what he said were his
administration's advances in

housing, jobs and pollution
control.
Kelly, 48, is a former Cleveland
service director but never before
ran for public office.
Reagan
SACRAMENTO (AP)-Gov.
Reagan, disagreeing with President

House-passed measure providing
for direct election of the

"To go to direct presidential
elections would be the greatest
blow to our sovereign states that
has been made for a long time."
His statement could signal
trouble ahead in California for the
proposed constitutional
amendment abolishing the
electoral college and giving the
presidential election to the
candidate receiving the largest
popular vote. If nobody got 40
percent of the vote, there would
be a run-off.
The Republican President
announced his support of the plan
earlier in the day.
As for his own political plans,
Reagan was less direct. He
declines to say when he would

announce whether he would run
for a second term—or even if he
has decided to make the race.
He was asked if he had made a
decision.
"I haven't and I'm not prepared
to make any statement," he
replied.
Reagan's advisers and friends
predict he will run next year.
