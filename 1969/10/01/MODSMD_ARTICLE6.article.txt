# Crowded Meeting
## SDS Looks To New Issues 
### CHRIS PECK 
T n spite of last spring's
suspensions, arrests, and internal
disagreement, the Stanford
chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS)
emerged last night, ambitious and
organized as ever.
More than 300 students were
on hand for a thirty minute film
clip of the April Third Movement
demonstration at the Hanover
I'freet branch of the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) last May.
The film, taken by a local TV
station news crew, drew various
levels of applause and boos as
police threw tear gas and charged
the students, and as Young
Americans for Freedom leader
Harvey Hukari stood atop a VW
van and harangued the protestors.
The audience cheered at camera
shots of a red flag being hoisted
outside of the SRI building and
also at pictures of graffiti on SRl's
walls declaring "No research
today."
Gone were the long,
unorganized speeches, gone were
inflammatory references to police,
administration, and government.
In their place, followed a precise
and organized agenda.
SDS then announced plans to
move actively into fields such as
women's liberation and high
school organization. The group
plans to expand to these areas
from localized campus issues such
as SRI and classified research
through a number of committees

dealing with political prisoners,
labor unions, dorm organization,
membership, guerilla theater, and
education.
A number of speakers
mentioned that SDS hopes to
improve its relationships with high
school organizers, the Black
Panthers, and women's liberation
movements.
A special appeal was made with
regard to relations with organized
labor, with the strike committee
for the Steelworkers Local 4028
making a brief appearance.
More than 20 SDS members
from campus had joined their
picket line on Monday morning.
The students plan to return every
Monday to lend support to the
strike at the Pittsburgh-Des

Moines Co. steel fabrication plant
in Santa Clara.
A spokesman for the strikers,
Bruce Heddinger, quipped, "We've
learned a lot about the student
movement. It's not all a bunch of
bullshit. We haven't found a
reason not to like SDS."
While there were many new
ideas being presented at the
meeting, there was still many old
ones. Paul Rupert, chairman of
the meeting, used the Vietnam
war as an example of SDS's
commitment to a new social
structure. "As the war continues,"
he said, "universities like Stanford
move closer to being one of the
casualities of that war. I think
that is a good thing."

administration, and government.
In their place, followed a precise
and organized agenda.
SDS then announced plans to
move actively into fields such as
women's liberation and high
school organization. The group
plans to expand to these areas
from localized campus issues such
as SRI and classified research
through a number of committees

dealing with political prisoners,
labor unions, dorm organization,
membership, guerilla theater, and
education.
A number of speakers
mentioned that SDS hopes to
improve its relationships with high
school organizers, the Black
Panthers, and women's liberation
movements.
A special appeal was made with
regard to relations with organized
labor, with the strike committee
for the Steelworkers Local 4028
making a brief appearance.
More than 20 SDS members
from campus had joined their
picket line on Monday morning.
The students plan to return every
Monday to lend support to the
strike at the Pittsburgh-Des

Moines Co. steel fabrication plant
in Santa Clara.
A spokesman for the strikers,
Bruce Heddinger, quipped, "We've
learned a lot about the student
movement. It's not all a bunch of
bullshit. We haven't found a
reason not to like SDS."
While there were many new
ideas being presented at the
meeting, there was still many old
ones. Paul Rupert, chairman of
the meeting, used the Vietnam
war as an example of SDS's
commitment to a new social
structure. "As the war continues,"
he said, "universities like Stanford
move closer to being one of the
casualities of that war. I think
that is a good thing."
T n spite of last spring's
suspensions, arrests, and internal
disagreement, the Stanford
chapter of Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS)
emerged last night, ambitious and
organized as ever.
More than 300 students were
on hand for a thirty minute film
clip of the April Third Movement
demonstration at the Hanover
I'freet branch of the Stanford
Research Institute (SRI) last May.
The film, taken by a local TV
station news crew, drew various
levels of applause and boos as
police threw tear gas and charged
the students, and as Young
Americans for Freedom leader
Harvey Hukari stood atop a VW
van and harangued the protestors.
The audience cheered at camera
shots of a red flag being hoisted
outside of the SRI building and
also at pictures of graffiti on SRl's
walls declaring "No research
today."
Gone were the long,
unorganized speeches, gone were
inflammatory references to police,
administration, and government.
