# On the Bandwagon
## Freshmen Welcome 
### 
I would like to join the growing
throng and say welcome to the
freshmen. They tell me that you
are a pretty sophisticated bunch,
that you are not nearly as straight
as my class was (is?).
In case you dont know, a lot
of people have gone to a lot of
trouble to get you here. You are
one of the few groups around that
will almost definitely have a place
to live. Almost half of your
number receive financial aid.
Four percent of you are black
and five percent of you are
Mexican-American. Maybe those
aren't very impressive numbers,
but, then again, 45% of the blacks
admitted decided to go elsewhere.
That was on account of
Harvard princetonandyaleâ€”they
were also giving it the old college
try.
For your assistance we have a
carefully screened group of
sponsors. This year Stanford can
even offer you assistant-sponsor
sponsors.
It's always a humbling
experience for Stanford students
to hear how smart they are. It is
for me anyhow. Three-fifths of
you had GPA's better than 3.8.
Almost 70% had Verbals better
than 600, more than three-fourths
of you had Math scores better
than 600.
So now that you are here, what
are you in for? As you know you
are about to experience more than
one kind of education. The
pre-meds in the class of '73 are in
for an amazingly cut-throat
competition for grades. The males
in general are in for about the
same kind of competition for the
females of '73. Many of the girls
are actually in for so much
attention that it will get to be a
drag by February.

What else is there? To our
much-maligned governor the
answer is "turmoil". I can assure
you that, of your number, "the
great majority are really interested
in genuine academic pursuits. It is
only a small minority that
disrupts the daily business of the
university." Take it or leave it.
The most important event at
LSJU may well be our first PAC-8
win in ages. On the side there is
also the SDS, the SES, and the
recently organized B of T's.
Try not to get snowed under.
Get out of your rooms. Look at
the new environment around you;
push it a little bit. Go over to the
coffee house. If you stay with the
"Daily" for more than a quarter
you'll likely find yourself an
editor.
I hope that you are as loose as I
hear you are. Stay loose. Stanford
can be a good place to learn about
a lot of things. The most
important of which is yourself.
The looser you are, the easier that
will be.
