## Grad Education 
### Barry Askinas 
(The following is the second
half of an article written by
Halsted Holman, Professor of
Medicine; Victor Hori, a graduate
student in Philosophy; Jeffrey
Orleans, a law student at Yale
University and Douglas Rund a
medical student. The article was
written as a part of the discussion
in last springs' Academic decision
to halt classified research on the
Stanford campus.)
At times it is argued that the
universities and their research
policy should indeed be
responsive to the public will, that
scientists and faculty members are
not an elite which can command
special privileges, that society has
a right to expect certain
accountings, and that the current
use of public monies in support of
research and development
represents the will of the people
as expressed by their
representatives. Therefore, it is
argued, all is well because the
public has given its assent to that
which is transpiring. While
expressing some agreement with
the initial tenets of this view, we
find its use in defending the
existing circumstances specious.
Perhaps the most important and
harmful consequence of the
explosive growth and influence of
technology is the position in
which it places the citizen. His
difficulty in understanding
technological developments is
great, and he has almost no
possibility of predicting the social
consequences of a particular
policy because such information
often does not exist or is not in
the public domain. To argue
therefore that the citizen has
given his informed consent to
existing practices is to make a
mockery of the concept of
informed consent.
Proposals
The establishment by citizens
of control over the forces which
affect their lives, and in particular
the reorientation of science and
technology into the service for all
segments of society, is a
commanding need. Many
approaches will contribute to that
goal; we would like to mention
three areas of action in which the
university could make a
substantial contribution.
The first would be the
development of a series of legal
principles which would govern the
interaction between technology
and the citizen. There is ample
experience from which to begin.
The balancing of governmental
and social practices with the rights
of citizens may be approached
through the"due process"
procedure wherein the citizen
claims and is extended the right to
understand what is being done to
him, to participate in the making
of decisions, and to attempt to
change the practices once the
consequences become known.
Furthermore, one of the main
purposes of the Constitution was
the protection of the individual
from harm by the state or other
institutions. Redefinition, for the
modern era, of those rights of the
autonomous individual which
must be protected by the state
could lead to a code of
responsibilities and limitations
governing echnological practices.
Finally, expansion of the concept
of federal regulatory agencies
might enlarge governmental
responsibility in this area.
A second approach toward
establishing the authority of

citizens over their lives could be
the development of a set of social
and political principles governing
the uses to which science and
technology will be put. The
creation of such a special body of
political policy would be
particularly beneficial because
most of our current political
concepts and practices were
developed in times when neither
individuals nor organizations
possessed the extraordinary power
to influence society which they
can achieve today.
A third approach involves the
university itself and forms the
basis for the proposals with which
we conclude this article. We
believe these proposals will
simultaneously strengthen the
independence of the university,
harness the support and creativity
of students, and contribute
appreciably to the well being of
society. The proposals are:
1. Seek a reallocation of
federal financial support through
government agencies such as the
National Science Foundation and
the National Institutes of Health
which are independent of
military, which establish priorities
for research that are aimed at
solution of social problems, and
which dispense monies through
the well established mechanism of
peer group review.
2. Generate support through
existing and new agencies for
programs of investigation on the
campus, involving faculty,
students and citizens, which
include such subjects as the
definition of new philosophical,
legal and administrative
relationships between technology
and society, and which aim at
broadening specific research
devoted to arms limitation,
environmental preservation, urban
renewal, expansion of education,
population control and related
issues. This might include the
establishment of a university
research fund, developed through
a tax on all externally supported
research projects, which would be
allocated by the university to the
initiation of new and meritorious
projects for which external
funding is not available.
3. Develop a sense of
community and mission within
the university investigative
programs through the use of
university peer group review for
all research proposals. The review
bodies could consist of faculty
and students not drawn
exclusively from the field from
which the investigation occurs.
The review body would not have
the authority to veto a particular
proposal but rather only to
suggest variations or extensions of
the proposal. It could also
encourage diversification in both
types of proposals and sources
from which funds are sought.
Individual faculty members could
still have the authority to pursue a
project and a particular funding
source but only after
consideration of the
recommendations of the review
group.
Whatever the merits of the
specific analyses or proposals
made in this article, it is our hope
that the problems will receive
increasing attention at Stanford
and that the University will adopt
new policies concerning its
research and educational activities
which will begin to eliminate the
serious distortions and dangers
present in existing policies and
practices.

allocated by the university to the
initiation of new and meritorious
projects for which external
funding is not available.
3. Develop a sense of
community and mission within
the university investigative
programs through the use of
university peer group review for
all research proposals. The review
bodies could consist of faculty
and students not drawn
exclusively from the field from
which the investigation occurs.
The review body would not have
the authority to veto a particular
proposal but rather only to
suggest variations or extensions of
the proposal. It could also
encourage diversification in both
types of proposals and sources
from which funds are sought.
Individual faculty members could
still have the authority to pursue a
project and a particular funding
source but only after
consideration of the
recommendations of the review
group.
Whatever the merits of the
specific analyses or proposals
made in this article, it is our hope
that the problems will receive
increasing attention at Stanford
and that the University will adopt
new policies concerning its
research and educational activities
which will begin to eliminate the
serious distortions and dangers
present in existing policies and
practices.
(The following is the second
half of an article written by
Halsted Holman, Professor of
Medicine; Victor Hori, a graduate
student in Philosophy; Jeffrey
Orleans, a law student at Yale
University and Douglas Rund a
medical student. The article was
written as a part of the discussion
in last springs' Academic decision
to halt classified research on the
Stanford campus.)
At times it is argued that the
universities and their research
policy should indeed be
responsive to the public will, that
scientists and faculty members are
not an elite which can command
special privileges, that society has
a right to expect certain
accountings, and that the current
use of public monies in support of
research and development
represents the will of the people
as expressed by their
representatives. Therefore, it is
argued, all is well because the
public has given its assent to that
which is transpiring. While
expressing some agreement with
the initial tenets of this view, we
find its use in defending the
existing circumstances specious.
Perhaps the most important and
harmful consequence of the
explosive growth and influence of
technology is the position in
which it places the citizen. His
difficulty in understanding
technological developments is
great, and he has almost no
possibility of predicting the social
consequences of a particular
policy because such information
often does not exist or is not in
the public domain. To argue
therefore that the citizen has
given his informed consent to
existing practices is to make a
mockery of the concept of
informed consent.
Proposals
The establishment by citizens
of control over the forces which
affect their lives, and in particular
the reorientation of science and
technology into the service for all
segments of society, is a
commanding need. Many
approaches will contribute to that
goal; we would like to mention
three areas of action in which the
university could make a
substantial contribution.
The first would be the
development of a series of legal
principles which would govern the
interaction between technology
and the citizen. There is ample
experience from which to begin.
The balancing of governmental
and social practices with the rights
of citizens may be approached
through the"due process"
procedure wherein the citizen
claims and is extended the right to
understand what is being done to
him, to participate in the making
of decisions, and to attempt to
change the practices once the
consequences become known.
Furthermore, one of the main
purposes of the Constitution was
the protection of the individual
from harm by the state or other
institutions. Redefinition, for the
modern era, of those rights of the
autonomous individual which
must be protected by the state
could lead to a code of
responsibilities and limitations
governing echnological practices.
Finally, expansion of the concept
of federal regulatory agencies
might enlarge governmental
responsibility in this area.
A second approach toward
establishing the authority of

citizens over their lives could be
the development of a set of social
and political principles governing
the uses to which science and
technology will be put. The
creation of such a special body of
political policy would be
particularly beneficial because
most of our current political
concepts and practices were
developed in times when neither
individuals nor organizations
possessed the extraordinary power
to influence society which they
can achieve today.
A third approach involves the
university itself and forms the
basis for the proposals with which
we conclude this article. We
believe these proposals will
simultaneously strengthen the
independence of the university,
harness the support and creativity
of students, and contribute
appreciably to the well being of
society. The proposals are:
1. Seek a reallocation of
federal financial support through
government agencies such as the
National Science Foundation and
the National Institutes of Health
which are independent of
military, which establish priorities
for research that are aimed at
solution of social problems, and
which dispense monies through
the well established mechanism of
peer group review.
2. Generate support through
existing and new agencies for
programs of investigation on the
campus, involving faculty,
students and citizens, which
include such subjects as the
definition of new philosophical,
legal and administrative
relationships between technology
and society, and which aim at
broadening specific research
devoted to arms limitation,
environmental preservation, urban
renewal, expansion of education,
population control and related
issues. This might include the
establishment of a university
research fund, developed through
a tax on all externally supported
research projects, which would be
allocated by the university to the
initiation of new and meritorious
projects for which external
funding is not available.

we conclude this article. We
believe these proposals will
simultaneously strengthen the
independence of the university,
harness the support and creativity
of students, and contribute
appreciably to the well being of
society. The proposals are:
1. Seek a reallocation of
federal financial support through
government agencies such as the
National Science Foundation and
the National Institutes of Health
which are independent of
military, which establish priorities
for research that are aimed at
solution of social problems, and
which dispense monies through
the well established mechanism of
peer group review.
2. Generate support through
existing and new agencies for
programs of investigation on the
campus, involving faculty,
students and citizens, which
include such subjects as the
definition of new philosophical,
legal and administrative
relationships between technology
and society, and which aim at
broadening specific research
devoted to arms limitation,
environmental preservation, urban
renewal, expansion of education,
population control and related
issues. This might include the
establishment of a university
research fund, developed through
a tax on all externally supported
research projects, which would be
allocated by the university to the
initiation of new and meritorious
projects for which external
funding is not available.
3. Develop a sense of
community and mission within
the university investigative
programs through the use of
university peer group review for
all research proposals. The review
bodies could consist of faculty
and students not drawn
exclusively from the field from
which the investigation occurs.
The review body would not have
the authority to veto a particular
proposal but rather only to
suggest variations or extensions of
the proposal. It could also
encourage diversification in both
types of proposals and sources
from which funds are sought.
Individual faculty members could
still have the authority to pursue a
project and a particular funding
source but only after
consideration of the
recommendations of the review
group.
Whatever the merits of the
specific analyses or proposals
made in this article, it is our hope
that the problems will receive
increasing attention at Stanford
and that the University will adopt
new policies concerning its
research and educational activities
which will begin to eliminate the
serious distortions and dangers
present in existing policies and
practices.
(The following is the second
half of an article written by
Halsted Holman, Professor of
Medicine; Victor Hori, a graduate
student in Philosophy; Jeffrey
Orleans, a law student at Yale
University and Douglas Rund a
medical student. The article was
written as a part of the discussion
in last springs' Academic decision
to halt classified research on the
Stanford campus.)
At times it is argued that the
universities and their research
policy should indeed be
responsive to the public will, that
scientists and faculty members are
not an elite which can command
special privileges, that society has
a right to expect certain
accountings, and that the current
use of public monies in support of
research and development
represents the will of the people
as expressed by their
representatives. Therefore, it is
argued, all is well because the
public has given its assent to that
which is transpiring. While
expressing some agreement with
the initial tenets of this view, we
find its use in defending the
existing circumstances specious.
Perhaps the most important and
harmful consequence of the
explosive growth and influence of
technology is the position in
which it places the citizen. His
difficulty in understanding
technological developments is
great, and he has almost no
possibility of predicting the social
consequences of a particular
policy because such information
often does not exist or is not in
the public domain. To argue
therefore that the citizen has
given his informed consent to
existing practices is to make a
mockery of the concept of
informed consent.
Proposals
The establishment by citizens
of control over the forces which
affect their lives, and in particular
the reorientation of science and
technology into the service for all
segments of society, is a
commanding need. Many
approaches will contribute to that
goal; we would like to mention
three areas of action in which the
university could make a
substantial contribution.
The first would be the
development of a series of legal
principles which would govern the
interaction between technology
and the citizen. There is ample
experience from which to begin.
The balancing of governmental
and social practices with the rights
of citizens may be approached
through the"due process"
procedure wherein the citizen
claims and is extended the right to
understand what is being done to
him, to participate in the making
of decisions, and to attempt to
change the practices once the
consequences become known.
Furthermore, one of the main
purposes of the Constitution was
the protection of the individual
from harm by the state or other
institutions. Redefinition, for the
modern era, of those rights of the
autonomous individual which
must be protected by the state
could lead to a code of
responsibilities and limitations
governing echnological practices.
Finally, expansion of the concept
of federal regulatory agencies
might enlarge governmental
responsibility in this area.
A second approach toward
establishing the authority of

citizens over their lives could be
the development of a set of social
and political principles governing
the uses to which science and
technology will be put. The
creation of such a special body of
political policy would be
particularly beneficial because
most of our current political
concepts and practices were
developed in times when neither
individuals nor organizations
possessed the extraordinary power
to influence society which they
can achieve today.
A third approach involves the
university itself and forms the
basis for the proposals with which
we conclude this article. We
believe these proposals will
simultaneously strengthen the
independence of the university,
harness the support and creativity
of students, and contribute
appreciably to the well being of
