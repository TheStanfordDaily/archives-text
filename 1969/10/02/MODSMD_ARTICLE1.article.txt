# Ford Grant To Finance 'Human Biology' Program
## 
### ROBERT MICHELET 
Plans for a new undergraduate
program in Human Biology at
Stanford, financed by a $1.9
million Ford Foundation grant,
were announced yesterday.
The interdisciplinary program,
involving medical, biological and
behavioral sciences, is the first of
its kind at a university.
Gordon Harrison, Ford
Foundation resources and
environment officer, called the
program a "first step" in creating
an intellectual discipline to solve
problems of human adaptation to
his environment.
Harrison said the purpose of
the program is "to arrive at a new
description of human behavior
that would integrate the biological
and social sciences."
Dr. Norman Kretchmer of the
Stanford Medical Center and
chairman of the program's
planning committee, said that
Human Biology is "not only the
biology of man, but of man in his
environment. It is a full definition
of biology—the lifyof man."
Year of Planning
The committee outlined a
two-phase development of the
program. The first begins
immediately and will be a year of
planning and experimentation,
during which some courses will be
offered on a trial basis, others
planned and library and
laboratory facilities developed.
The second stage, beginning
Fall 1970, will be a five-year
period when the curriculum will
be offered and tested as a regular

interdepartmental major. The
program, soon to be presented to
the Academic Senate for approval,
will start accepting students in
Fall '70, with the curriculum to
begin Spring '71.
The impetus for the program
was given last year by students in
the Stanford Population and
Environment Forum. Details were
handled by a committee of senior
faculty members from the School
of Humanities and Sciences and
the School of Medicine.
In addition to Kretchmer,
committee members are
professors Sanford Dornbusch of
sociology, biologists Paul Ehrlich,
Donald Kennedy and Colin
Pittendrigh, psychiatrist David
Hamburg, psychologist Albert
Hastorf and geneticist Joshua
Lederberg.
Influence On Education
President Kenneth Pitzer,
giving his enthusiastic support,
said the program is "one of the
most exciting and important
things that has happened at
Stanford." Citing the project as "a
very effective team effort," Pitzer
said it will make "a major positive
contribution here and ... a great
influence on higher education
nationally."
The program will bridge the
gap between the biological and
social sciences, and correct
deficiencies in undergraduate
curricula. Students in all
university departments, not only
the sciences, will be encouraged to
join the program.

The present outline for the
curriculum consists of biological
core studies starting late in the
freshman year.
"Man and Society," an
interdisciplinary, biology-oriented
course in the behavioral sciences,
is planned for the sophomore
year.
In addition to material on
psychology, sociology,
anthropology and political
behavior, the course will include
special topics in biology and its
relation to man's behavior and
environment.
Students will select their
studies for the final two years
from two groups of courses, the
"Biology of Man" and
"Population, Environment and
Policy." Study in both areas,
though, will be required.
"Biology of Man" will include
physiology and homeostatis,
human development, primate
evolution and human origins and
other medical and biological
electives.
Included in the "Population,
Environment and Policy" portion
will be studies of population
biology, food economics,
environmental management case
studies and environmental health.
Work on pollution and natural
resources will also be a part of the
program.
Opportunity for Field Work
"The program is designed to
occupy no more than 50 percent
of the student's time, leaving
ample opportunity for field work

and electives," Dr. Kretchmer
noted.
Kretchmer said this is "a very
new undergraduate program in
biology. It cuts across the
bureaucracy of schools," bringing
the Medical School into closer
contact with the university.
Dornbusch, noting the
committee has "more aspirations
than achievements," said the
present Stanford faculty will be
inadequate to staff the program,
and recruiting will be necessary.
He noted the program does not
carry any restrictions on the
number of students, and said "we
expect this to be very popular, a
major university effort."

FORD-GRANT—Members of faculty committee announce plans for new undergraduate program in Human Biology at
press conference Wednesday. From left, committee members are sociology professor Sanford Dornbusch, Chairman Dr.
Norman Kretchmer and Vice-Provost Howard Brooks. President Kenneth Pitzer looks on. The project is an
interdisciplinary program of studies linking biological and social sciences and dealing with topics of man's environment and
behavior. The program, described by Brooks as "having a lot of flexibility," is financed by a $1.9 million grant from the
Ford Foundation. Work on final plans for the project is now in progress.
