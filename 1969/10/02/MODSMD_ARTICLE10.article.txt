## Wage Review Asked 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
I accuse! I accuse the faculty
and the administrators of failing
to pay employees the salaries
outlined in the Stanford
University guidelines.
I accuse the personnel
Department of condoning, if not
encouraging, these gross inequities
in pay scales and classification. I
accuse the faculty and the
administrators of attempting to
solve their problems at the
expense of and out of the pockets
of employees.
I believe that the employees,
represented by an organization
such as United Stanford
Employees, should select a broad
committee to review
classifications and wage scales
with the Personnel Department.
This employee commi',tce should
be empowered to hold open
meetings in every building to
which employees can come and be
heard. Faculty and administrators
who determine the individual
wage rates should be invited to
explain the reasoning behind their
decisionsâ€”decisions which to us
seem so unfair and anarchic.
The Teamsters Union, at the
request of a group of Stanford
workers, held a meeting to outline
the advantages of joining their
Union. I attended this meeting at

Hyatt House. The battery of
organizers present was impressive.
I cannot deny that history has
shown that the Teamsters Union
can win substantial wage increases
and other financial benefits for its
members. It will find fertile
ground in the resentment of
workers at Stanford. Their
ultimate power, as they stated it,
is in their ability to cripple the
functioning of the University by
stopping deliveries of supplies.
This power is enhanced by the
support of other AFL unions.
There is power in organization.
Most of us who work at
Stanford identify with the
Stanford Community. We prefer
to have our own independent,
aggressively dynamic and
democratic employee organization
that we ourselves can control.
Many of. us believe that by our
solidarity and the might of our
numbers we can secure equitable
and comparative wages as well as
secure the satisfaction of other
broad needs.
First, a minimum wage of
$450/ month must be made
uniform throughout the
University. Secondly, wages and
classifications should be adjusted
immediately to conform to the
wage scale guidelines already
established by the Vice Presidents
of the University.

I urge all employees to sign the
petition to President Pitzer
requesting that the present
classifications and wage ranges be
published and posted.
I urge all employees to join us
in helping to build a broad, all
inclusive University-wide
employees organization in order
to claim our rights.

File SS Forms
Editor, The DAILY:
If the United States govern
ment were to hold a referendum
on the Vietnam war in which the
youth of the nation were allowed
to vote, there is little doubt that
the young people would vote the
war out of existence. For both
legal and political reasons such a
referendum can and will not be
held. Yet if the youth of our
nation are resolute there seems to
be a way for them to hold their
own referendum using a system
that has been set up by the
government. Each time a SS Form
150 is filed it becomes a statistic
within the selective service sys
tem. Should a million young
people file SS Form 150, it would
be a mandate from the youth that
the war be ended at once. The
filing of the form is not an act of
civil disobediance but is a right
under the SS system. Since in all
but a few cases the board clerk
will routinely deny the CO appli
cation, the referendum will add
little burden to the members of
the nation's draft boards. It will
allow each youth to vote soon
after his 18th birthday. Copies of
the form could be printed in the
newspapers to make sure that the
administration did not find itself
short of supplies and funds to
print new copies of SS Form 150
I encourage all of this nation's
youth to file a SS Form 150
during the month of December.
Further I request those that share
my concern in this matter to
publicize this youthful referen
dum.
