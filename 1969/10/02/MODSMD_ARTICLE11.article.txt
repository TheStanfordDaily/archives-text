## Schwartzkopf's War 
### Art Buchwald 
The year 1997 (cq) will go into
history as the year the Vietnam
conflict became known as
"Schwartzkopf's war." President
Nathaniel Schwartzkopf certainly
didn't start the Vietnamese war.
He inherited it from President
Zimmerman when it was called
"Zimmerman's war." President
Zimmerman inherited the war
from President Luther Bainbridge,
who was defeated for a second
term when his opponents tagged
Vietnam as "Bainbridge's war."
This was unfair because
President Bainbridge had gotten
stuck with the war when President
Samuel Goodbody announced he
would not run for a second term
if people didn't stop calling it
"Goodbody's war."
Before President Goodbody,
the Vietnam hostilities were
known as "Fowler's war" in
honor of President Whitney
Fowler, who promised to have the
American boys out of Vietnam by
Shirley Temple's birthday.
"Agnew's War"
He obviously failed to meet the
timetable; but observers at that
time admitted that President
Fowler was not at fault. He had
taken on the task of finding a
solution at the time it was known
as "Agnew's war." President
Agnew took over the war when
President Nixon decided not to
run in 1972, because everyone
called it "Nixon's war." He said
they should have known it was
"Johnson's war."
President Johnson, in one of his
rare interviews at the LBJ ranch,
muttered it should have been
called "Kennedy's and
Eisenhower's war."
In any case President Nathaniel
Schwartzkopf, who won a close
election in 1996 by promising the
electorate that he had a solution
to the Vietnamese war, ran into
the same difficulty that other
Presidents had. Hanoi was being
adamant in Paris and, according to
President Schwartzkopf, the
United States had gone as far as it
could in finding a just and fair
settlement.

For example, President Agnew
had offered the North Vietnamese
Saigon and Hue. But Hanoi's
negotiations in Paris said it was
just a trick to make them settle.
To show his good faith, President
Goodbody, when he took over,
said that he would let the
Vietnamese have Australia as well.
This might have broken the ice in
Paris, except that Australia got
wind of it and leaked the story to
the press. Once it was in the
newspapers, Hanoi said it had
been hoodwinked by Goodbody
and called off negotiations for six
months.
President Bainbridge, who
knew his political career was at
stake, sent word that if the North
Vietnamese would accept even a
cease-fire they could have
Switzerland.
Hanoi was tempted to accept
this proposal, except that
President Nu Twang of South
Vietnam held a press conference
and said that he would never agree
to Switzerland becoming part of
North Vietnam.
In order to placate President
Nu Twang, Bainbridge said that if
South Vietnam permitted Hanoi
to have Switzerland, the United
States would give the Saigon
government Sweden.
Hanoi Kejects Again
Before President Nu Twang
could give his reply, Hanoi
rejected the U.S. offer in hopes
they could get a better deal by
waiting for President Zimmerman
to be elected.
But President Zimmerman
failed miserably, and it is now
President Schwartzkopf's turn. He
got off to a good start by
promising Hanoi if they agreed to
a settlement they could have all
the land in the U.S. west of the
Mississippi.
But a bulletin just in from Paris
says that Hanoi has turned the
proposal down.

negotiations in Paris said it was
just a trick to make them settle.
To show his good faith, President
Goodbody, when he took over,
said that he would let the
Vietnamese have Australia as well.
This might have broken the ice in
Paris, except that Australia got
wind of it and leaked the story to
the press. Once it was in the
newspapers, Hanoi said it had
been hoodwinked by Goodbody
and called off negotiations for six
months.
President Bainbridge, who
knew his political career was at
stake, sent word that if the North
Vietnamese would accept even a
cease-fire they could have
Switzerland.
Hanoi was tempted to accept
this proposal, except that
President Nu Twang of South
Vietnam held a press conference
and said that he would never agree
to Switzerland becoming part of
North Vietnam.
In order to placate President
Nu Twang, Bainbridge said that if
South Vietnam permitted Hanoi
to have Switzerland, the United
States would give the Saigon
government Sweden.
Hanoi Kejects Again
Before President Nu Twang
could give his reply, Hanoi
rejected the U.S. offer in hopes
they could get a better deal by
waiting for President Zimmerman
to be elected.
But President Zimmerman
failed miserably, and it is now
President Schwartzkopf's turn. He
got off to a good start by
promising Hanoi if they agreed to
a settlement they could have all
the land in the U.S. west of the
Mississippi.
But a bulletin just in from Paris
says that Hanoi has turned the
proposal down.

The year 1997 (cq) will go into
history as the year the Vietnam
conflict became known as
"Schwartzkopf's war." President
Nathaniel Schwartzkopf certainly
didn't start the Vietnamese war.
He inherited it from President
Zimmerman when it was called
"Zimmerman's war." President
Zimmerman inherited the war
from President Luther Bainbridge,
who was defeated for a second
term when his opponents tagged
Vietnam as "Bainbridge's war."
This was unfair because
President Bainbridge had gotten
stuck with the war when President
Samuel Goodbody announced he
would not run for a second term
if people didn't stop calling it
"Goodbody's war."
Before President Goodbody,
the Vietnam hostilities were
known as "Fowler's war" in
honor of President Whitney
Fowler, who promised to have the
American boys out of Vietnam by
Shirley Temple's birthday.
"Agnew's War"
He obviously failed to meet the
timetable; but observers at that
time admitted that President
Fowler was not at fault. He had
taken on the task of finding a
solution at the time it was known
as "Agnew's war." President
Agnew took over the war when
President Nixon decided not to
run in 1972, because everyone
called it "Nixon's war." He said
they should have known it was
"Johnson's war."
President Johnson, in one of his
rare interviews at the LBJ ranch,
muttered it should have been
called "Kennedy's and
Eisenhower's war."
In any case President Nathaniel
Schwartzkopf, who won a close
election in 1996 by promising the
electorate that he had a solution
to the Vietnamese war, ran into
the same difficulty that other
Presidents had. Hanoi was being
adamant in Paris and, according to
President Schwartzkopf, the
United States had gone as far as it
could in finding a just and fair
settlement.

For example, President Agnew
had offered the North Vietnamese
Saigon and Hue. But Hanoi's
negotiations in Paris said it was
just a trick to make them settle.
To show his good faith, President
Goodbody, when he took over,
said that he would let the
Vietnamese have Australia as well.
