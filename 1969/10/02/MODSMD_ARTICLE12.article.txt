# The 						Other Side
## Industrialists Speak 
### Diane Cameron 
"Hey—pig-woman! Guess you
know which side your bread is
buttered on!" The reporter, since
she was dressed in costume of the
establishment, had been
automatically classified and
judged by demonstrators outside
the International Industrial
Conference held last week in San
Francisco. Earlier in the day, hair
hanging loose and looking
unpardonably "student," she had
literally had the "arm" put on her
by the other side: a security
officer had become suspicious of
her taking photographs of the
police lined up among the
flower-beds in front of the
Fairmont Hotel. In both cases she
was trying to get an objective
report of the events taking place
at this conference of world
business leaders. The
demonstrators tried to cross
police lines to speak with the
participants; many of the
participants of the conference
wanted to cross the barricade to
talk with the demonstrators;
neither fucceeded in crossing the
street that runs in front of the
Fairmont Hotel.

The european participants
interviewed gave an impression of
genuine interest in the viewpoints
of the demonstrators and
expressed regret that security was
so stringent. They felt frustrated
that those outside the hotel were
not aware of their desire to
improve world-wide living
conditions.
Producing a healthy economy,
according to one French
businessman is the pre-requisite to
improved conditions for the
common man. He emphasized
that he had helped more people
by contributing to the economy
than by complaining about his
former ($3O per month) state of
poverty.
American Participation
Everyone interviewed
supported American participation
in the European economy. Mr.
Jean Forgeot of Schneider S.A.
believes that foreign investment is
necessary, if controlled and
tailored to the specific problems
of the recipient country.
Cooperation in decision-making
between American investors and
European nationals is essential to
the well-being of European
economies.
The French delegates in
particular seemed exasperated at
the special dilemma confronting
the French economy today.
According to Mr. Edmond Lanier
of the French Line, France has
become a highly productive
country (her increase in
productivity per working person is
twice that of the USA in the last
ten years).
The stereotype of the
devil-may-care, two-hour lunch,
cafe-dwelling frenchman is being
supplanted by a hard-working, 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. member of a
rapidly industrializing state.
However, Mr. Lanier sees the
events of May, 1968 as a
regrettable setback to the French
economic development. Other
participants in the conference
agreed with him that the
"revolution" had been
unpredictable, and that "history
has no pre-direction." Mr.
Forgeot, on the other hand, views
the discontent as the necessary
result of the imbalance of
European economy. It is passing
through a painful transitionary
period, he says, between the
exigencies of a post-war period
economy and the enlightenment
of the future economy. The
"Events of May," for one
convention delegate, are the major
"landmark in French history."
Trust and cooperation between
government and labor, said
another, is an immediate necessity
if the common goals of both
interests are not to be thwarted.

Mr. Forgeot foresees as inevitable
many more strikes by workers in
France. He does not expect a
repetition of the paralyzing strike
of May: vast changes in
government policy should assuage
the frustration that led to such an
occurrence.
All of the industrial experts
interviewed heartily approved of
the recent measures taken by the
French Government. The
devaluation, restrictions on
currency exchange, and
restrictions of credits were
considered essential by Mr.
Lanier. He believes that the
measures have been quite effective
thus far, but feels that some time
must pass before a judgment can
be pronounced. An officer of an
automobile firm expressed
confidence in the efficiency of
controls: he gave the example of a
Frenchman who recently tried to
take 5000 (about $12,000) out
of France to England; he was
caught and fined $24,000! Mr.
Forgeot agreed that the
government measures are the best
possible, but indicated that they
should have been effected ten
years ago, before the shattering
loss of faith had gripped the
country.
Effective Europe
Mr. Forgeot and others envision
an effective Europe united not
only economically through the
common Market, but politically as
well. They see Nationalism as the
enemy of a progressive Europe. If
the Continent is to effectively
utilize its human and natural
resources for the benefit of its
inhabitants, it must unite.
Communication must be open
among industrialists, governments,
and the people.
If the student demonstrators
outside the Fairmont Hotel had
been able to exchange views with
participants in the conference,
they might have heard some
exciting ideas (yes, coming from
surprisingly concerned members
of "Big Business"). Had the
students sent a delegation of
spokesmen to the conference,
they might have provoked some
of the more taciturn members of
"Big Business" to rejuvenate their
concepts. Whatever the attitudes
of Industry have been in the past,
it now seems anxious for a
dialogue. The demonstrators are
no more malcontented termites
than are the giants of industry
earless stone monoliths. Both
stereotypes are made up of human
beings stymied by the barriers
against communications.

confidence in the efficiency of
controls: he gave the example of a
Frenchman who recently tried to
take 5000 (about $12,000) out
of France to England; he was
caught and fined $24,000! Mr.
Forgeot agreed that the
government measures are the best
possible, but indicated that they
should have been effected ten
years ago, before the shattering
loss of faith had gripped the
country.
Effective Europe
Mr. Forgeot and others envision
an effective Europe united not
only economically through the
common Market, but politically as
well. They see Nationalism as the
enemy of a progressive Europe. If
the Continent is to effectively
utilize its human and natural
resources for the benefit of its
inhabitants, it must unite.
Communication must be open
among industrialists, governments,
and the people.
If the student demonstrators
outside the Fairmont Hotel had
been able to exchange views with
participants in the conference,
they might have heard some
exciting ideas (yes, coming from
surprisingly concerned members
of "Big Business"). Had the
students sent a delegation of
spokesmen to the conference,
they might have provoked some
of the more taciturn members of
"Big Business" to rejuvenate their
concepts. Whatever the attitudes
of Industry have been in the past,
it now seems anxious for a
dialogue. The demonstrators are
no more malcontented termites
than are the giants of industry
earless stone monoliths. Both
stereotypes are made up of human
beings stymied by the barriers
against communications.
Diane Cameron attended the
1 ntcr national / ndustrialist
Conference (IIC) in San Francisco
Sept. 15. The above is her
description of what she saw.
"Hey—pig-woman! Guess you
know which side your bread is
buttered on!" The reporter, since
she was dressed in costume of the
establishment, had been
automatically classified and
judged by demonstrators outside
the International Industrial
Conference held last week in San
Francisco. Earlier in the day, hair
hanging loose and looking
unpardonably "student," she had
literally had the "arm" put on her
by the other side: a security
officer had become suspicious of
her taking photographs of the
police lined up among the
flower-beds in front of the
Fairmont Hotel. In both cases she
was trying to get an objective
report of the events taking place
at this conference of world
business leaders. The
demonstrators tried to cross
police lines to speak with the
participants; many of the
participants of the conference
wanted to cross the barricade to
talk with the demonstrators;
neither fucceeded in crossing the
street that runs in front of the
Fairmont Hotel.

The european participants
interviewed gave an impression of
genuine interest in the viewpoints
of the demonstrators and
expressed regret that security was
so stringent. They felt frustrated
that those outside the hotel were
not aware of their desire to
improve world-wide living
conditions.
Producing a healthy economy,
according to one French
businessman is the pre-requisite to
improved conditions for the
common man. He emphasized
that he had helped more people
by contributing to the economy
than by complaining about his
former ($3O per month) state of
poverty.
American Participation
Everyone interviewed
supported American participation
in the European economy. Mr.
Jean Forgeot of Schneider S.A.
believes that foreign investment is
necessary, if controlled and
tailored to the specific problems
of the recipient country.
Cooperation in decision-making
between American investors and
European nationals is essential to
the well-being of European
economies.
The French delegates in
particular seemed exasperated at
the special dilemma confronting
the French economy today.
According to Mr. Edmond Lanier
of the French Line, France has
become a highly productive
country (her increase in
productivity per working person is
twice that of the USA in the last
ten years).
The stereotype of the
devil-may-care, two-hour lunch,
cafe-dwelling frenchman is being
supplanted by a hard-working, 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. member of a
rapidly industrializing state.
However, Mr. Lanier sees the
events of May, 1968 as a
regrettable setback to the French
economic development. Other
participants in the conference
agreed with him that the
"revolution" had been
unpredictable, and that "history
has no pre-direction." Mr.
Forgeot, on the other hand, views
the discontent as the necessary
result of the imbalance of
European economy. It is passing
through a painful transitionary
period, he says, between the
exigencies of a post-war period
economy and the enlightenment
of the future economy. The
"Events of May," for one
convention delegate, are the major
"landmark in French history."
Trust and cooperation between
government and labor, said
another, is an immediate necessity
if the common goals of both
interests are not to be thwarted.

Mr. Forgeot foresees as inevitable
many more strikes by workers in
France. He does not expect a
repetition of the paralyzing strike
of May: vast changes in
government policy should assuage
the frustration that led to such an
occurrence.
All of the industrial experts
interviewed heartily approved of
the recent measures taken by the
French Government. The
devaluation, restrictions on
currency exchange, and
restrictions of credits were
considered essential by Mr.
Lanier. He believes that the
measures have been quite effective
thus far, but feels that some time
must pass before a judgment can
be pronounced. An officer of an
automobile firm expressed
confidence in the efficiency of
controls: he gave the example of a
Frenchman who recently tried to
take 5000 (about $12,000) out
of France to England; he was

The stereotype of the
devil-may-care, two-hour lunch,
cafe-dwelling frenchman is being
supplanted by a hard-working, 8
a.m. to 6 p.m. member of a
rapidly industrializing state.
However, Mr. Lanier sees the
events of May, 1968 as a
regrettable setback to the French
economic development. Other
participants in the conference
agreed with him that the
"revolution" had been
unpredictable, and that "history
has no pre-direction." Mr.
Forgeot, on the other hand, views
the discontent as the necessary
result of the imbalance of
European economy. It is passing
through a painful transitionary
period, he says, between the
exigencies of a post-war period
economy and the enlightenment
of the future economy. The
"Events of May," for one
convention delegate, are the major
"landmark in French history."
Trust and cooperation between
government and labor, said
another, is an immediate necessity
if the common goals of both
interests are not to be thwarted.

Mr. Forgeot foresees as inevitable
many more strikes by workers in
France. He does not expect a
repetition of the paralyzing strike
of May: vast changes in
government policy should assuage
the frustration that led to such an
occurrence.
All of the industrial experts
interviewed heartily approved of
the recent measures taken by the
French Government. The
devaluation, restrictions on
currency exchange, and
restrictions of credits were
considered essential by Mr.
Lanier. He believes that the
measures have been quite effective
thus far, but feels that some time
must pass before a judgment can
be pronounced. An officer of an
automobile firm expressed
confidence in the efficiency of
controls: he gave the example of a
Frenchman who recently tried to
take 5000 (about $12,000) out
of France to England; he was
caught and fined $24,000! Mr.
Forgeot agreed that the
government measures are the best
possible, but indicated that they
should have been effected ten
years ago, before the shattering
loss of faith had gripped the
country.
Effective Europe
Mr. Forgeot and others envision
an effective Europe united not
only economically through the
common Market, but politically as
well. They see Nationalism as the
enemy of a progressive Europe. If
the Continent is to effectively
utilize its human and natural
resources for the benefit of its
inhabitants, it must unite.
Communication must be open
among industrialists, governments,
and the people.
If the student demonstrators
outside the Fairmont Hotel had
been able to exchange views with
participants in the conference,
they might have heard some
exciting ideas (yes, coming from
surprisingly concerned members
of "Big Business"). Had the
students sent a delegation of
spokesmen to the conference,
they might have provoked some
of the more taciturn members of
"Big Business" to rejuvenate their
concepts. Whatever the attitudes
of Industry have been in the past,
it now seems anxious for a
dialogue. The demonstrators are
no more malcontented termites
than are the giants of industry
earless stone monoliths. Both
stereotypes are made up of human
beings stymied by the barriers
against communications.

1 ntcr national / ndustrialist
Conference (IIC) in San Francisco
Sept. 15. The above is her
description of what she saw.
"Hey—pig-woman! Guess you
know which side your bread is
buttered on!" The reporter, since
she was dressed in costume of the
establishment, had been
automatically classified and
judged by demonstrators outside
the International Industrial
Conference held last week in San
Francisco. Earlier in the day, hair
hanging loose and looking
unpardonably "student," she had
literally had the "arm" put on her
by the other side: a security
officer had become suspicious of
her taking photographs of the
police lined up among the
flower-beds in front of the
Fairmont Hotel. In both cases she
was trying to get an objective
report of the events taking place
at this conference of world
business leaders. The
demonstrators tried to cross
police lines to speak with the
participants; many of the
participants of the conference
wanted to cross the barricade to
talk with the demonstrators;
neither fucceeded in crossing the
street that runs in front of the
Fairmont Hotel.

The european participants
interviewed gave an impression of
genuine interest in the viewpoints
of the demonstrators and
expressed regret that security was
so stringent. They felt frustrated
that those outside the hotel were
not aware of their desire to
improve world-wide living
conditions.
Producing a healthy economy,
according to one French
businessman is the pre-requisite to
improved conditions for the
common man. He emphasized
that he had helped more people
by contributing to the economy
than by complaining about his
former ($3O per month) state of
poverty.
American Participation
Everyone interviewed
supported American participation
in the European economy. Mr.
Jean Forgeot of Schneider S.A.
believes that foreign investment is
necessary, if controlled and
tailored to the specific problems
of the recipient country.
Cooperation in decision-making
between American investors and
European nationals is essential to
the well-being of European
economies.
The French delegates in
particular seemed exasperated at
the special dilemma confronting
the French economy today.
According to Mr. Edmond Lanier
of the French Line, France has
become a highly productive
country (her increase in
productivity per working person is
twice that of the USA in the last
ten years).
