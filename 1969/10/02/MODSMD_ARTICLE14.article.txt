# No Rights?
## Women's Liberation 
### 
The following is an excerpt
from a newsletter circulated
around the campus by The
Women's Liberation Front. The
WLF is dedicated to changing
"the conditions which oppress
women at Stanford." A meeting
for all interested females will be
held next Tuesday, October 7, at
7:30 p.m. in room 270 of
Tresidder. Child care will be
available.
Women are discriminated
against in admissions by
Stanford's notorious "30% ratio."
What this m«ans is that it is twice
as hard for a qualified woman to
be admitted. Only 15% of
graduate students are women.
Andless than 5% of the faculty are
women, almost 3 A of whom are at
the lowest faculty rank, assistant
professor. Most women teachers

are lecturers or instructors
(translation: lower pay, fewer
privileges, no tenure).
There are no woman heads of
departments. No top
administrators are women—except
for the dean of women, of course.
Of all the "student wives" in
Escondido Village, only a handful
are students, though many would
like to be. Fellowships and
scholarships (when available) are
so small wives have to work to
help great Stanford University
out. There is no reduction of
tuition for student wives.
Despite the number of students
and employees with children,
Stanford provides no day care
facilities. Under heavy pressure,
they may start this year, but
indications are they will charge
$35.95 a month per child. Who
can afford that?
Employees' Flight
Stanford employees, most of
whom are women, are paid less
than the going rate "on the
outside.'' Women are
concentrated in the lower job
categories, mostly in secretarial
positions. It is not unusual for an
"executive secretary" with 20
years experience to make under
$500 a month. Until recently,
they have had no union to fight
for their rights, and the new
Union of Stanford Employees still
has a long struggle ahead to win
recognition.
Women students are tracked
into certain fields—over half major
in English, languages, history, and
psychology. Low-paying fields.
Statistics, engineering physics,
business, and economics are
considered men's fields, with over
90% male enrollment. See a
pattern?
Hole In Classroom
In classes, women tend to be
passive. You will find that your
professors (mostly male) tend to
assume that women are more
suited to some kinds of study
than others, are less intellectual
than men, can't think rationally,
are not serious about a career, are
emotionally unstable, are "only
hero to get a husband." They will
tell you that we are "bad risks"
for graduate school, since we are
"likely to quit to get married."
Many disciplines are often
taught with a male supremist bias:
history, psychology, sociology,
art, and literature. Think about
the image of women projected in
the next novel you rtad, See if
your professor does anything in
class to challenge it.

Escondido Village, only a handful
are students, though many would
like to be. Fellowships and
scholarships (when available) are
so small wives have to work to
help great Stanford University
out. There is no reduction of
tuition for student wives.
Despite the number of students
and employees with children,
Stanford provides no day care
facilities. Under heavy pressure,
they may start this year, but
indications are they will charge
$35.95 a month per child. Who
can afford that?
Employees' Flight
Stanford employees, most of
whom are women, are paid less
than the going rate "on the
outside.'' Women are
concentrated in the lower job
categories, mostly in secretarial
positions. It is not unusual for an
"executive secretary" with 20
years experience to make under
$500 a month. Until recently,
they have had no union to fight
for their rights, and the new
Union of Stanford Employees still
has a long struggle ahead to win
recognition.
Women students are tracked
into certain fields—over half major
in English, languages, history, and
psychology. Low-paying fields.
Statistics, engineering physics,
business, and economics are
considered men's fields, with over
90% male enrollment. See a
pattern?
Hole In Classroom
In classes, women tend to be
passive. You will find that your
professors (mostly male) tend to
assume that women are more
suited to some kinds of study
than others, are less intellectual
than men, can't think rationally,
are not serious about a career, are
emotionally unstable, are "only
hero to get a husband." They will
tell you that we are "bad risks"
for graduate school, since we are
"likely to quit to get married."
Many disciplines are often
taught with a male supremist bias:
history, psychology, sociology,
art, and literature. Think about
the image of women projected in
the next novel you rtad, See if
your professor does anything in
class to challenge it.
The following is an excerpt
from a newsletter circulated
around the campus by The
Women's Liberation Front. The
WLF is dedicated to changing
"the conditions which oppress
women at Stanford." A meeting
for all interested females will be
held next Tuesday, October 7, at
7:30 p.m. in room 270 of
Tresidder. Child care will be
available.
Women are discriminated
against in admissions by
Stanford's notorious "30% ratio."
What this m«ans is that it is twice
as hard for a qualified woman to
be admitted. Only 15% of
graduate students are women.
Andless than 5% of the faculty are
women, almost 3 A of whom are at
the lowest faculty rank, assistant
professor. Most women teachers

are lecturers or instructors
(translation: lower pay, fewer
privileges, no tenure).
There are no woman heads of
departments. No top
administrators are women—except
for the dean of women, of course.
