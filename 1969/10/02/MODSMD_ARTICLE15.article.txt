# Harvard Lampoon Parody
## Time Has A New Sexy Look 
### WILLIAM F. NICHOLSON ASSOCIATED PRESS WRITER 
Time magazine—or what looks
like Time magazine—has some
unusual items for readers this
week.
For instance:
The magazine's television
listings include this special—
"YOU I) It, CHARLIE
BROWN NBC 9-10 p.m. The
famous comic strip characters are
at it again. In this special, Charlie
Brown kills Linus and Violet with
a ball pen hammer, Lucy falls
victim to a child molester and
Snoopy is put to sleep. Repeat."
And in the"Letters" section,
under the heading "Man of the
Year," is this note:
"Sir: It is with deepest regret
that 1 must ask you to disregard
my letter of some months ago.
A. Fortas
"Washington, D.C."
Actually, it isn't Time
magazine at all, but a parody by
the Harvard Lampoon, the
university's humor and social
club, which went on sale Monday.
The 500,000 copies, reported
selling briskly at $1 each, are
being distributed in the United
States, other English-speaking
countries and South Vietnam.

The Lampoon also publishes it.s
own humor magazine during the
year.
The Lampoon editors received
Time, Inc.'s permission to use
Time's logotype, and put together
a 96-page issue during the summer
with enough legitimate advertising
to net their club treasury about
$50,000.
On the cover, with its
distinctive red Time border, is an
attractive blonde—a girl friend of

%/
a Lampoon member—wearing
only a newsdealer's Newsweek
apron and holding a Time parody
issue.
The cover story: "Does SEX
Sell Magazines?"
Inside are four pages of color
photographs of Lampoon men
and girl volunteers from Harvard's
summer school in Cambridge,
Mass. They posed in the nude and
satirized current trends in the
theater.

The magazine also has a
take-off on the Time-Louis Harris
poll, this one done on "America's
Changing Morality."
After a "weekend in Port
Alligator, Fla." the bogus Harris
and his staff found that most
Americans feel:
"A white grocer who sells
green tomatoes to a black
customer is worse than a White
Russian who sells red caviar on
the black market" and "94 per
cent believed that if God had
meant man to take drugs on the
street, He wouldn't have invented
drugstores."

TIME'S HORIZONS arc considerably broadened in their latest issue, published,
iiol by Henry Lura, bul by Ibe Harvard Lampoon. On sale at newsstands soon.
Time magazine—or what looks
like Time magazine—has some
unusual items for readers this
week.
For instance:
The magazine's television
listings include this special—
"YOU I) It, CHARLIE
BROWN NBC 9-10 p.m. The
famous comic strip characters are
at it again. In this special, Charlie
Brown kills Linus and Violet with
a ball pen hammer, Lucy falls
victim to a child molester and
Snoopy is put to sleep. Repeat."
And in the"Letters" section,
under the heading "Man of the
Year," is this note:
"Sir: It is with deepest regret
that 1 must ask you to disregard
my letter of some months ago.
A. Fortas
"Washington, D.C."
Actually, it isn't Time
magazine at all, but a parody by
the Harvard Lampoon, the
university's humor and social
club, which went on sale Monday.
The 500,000 copies, reported
selling briskly at $1 each, are
being distributed in the United
States, other English-speaking
countries and South Vietnam.

The Lampoon also publishes it.s
own humor magazine during the
year.
The Lampoon editors received
Time, Inc.'s permission to use
Time's logotype, and put together
a 96-page issue during the summer
with enough legitimate advertising
to net their club treasury about
$50,000.
On the cover, with its
distinctive red Time border, is an
attractive blonde—a girl friend of

%/
a Lampoon member—wearing
only a newsdealer's Newsweek
apron and holding a Time parody
issue.
The cover story: "Does SEX
Sell Magazines?"
Inside are four pages of color
photographs of Lampoon men
and girl volunteers from Harvard's
summer school in Cambridge,
Mass. They posed in the nude and
satirized current trends in the
theater.

The magazine also has a
take-off on the Time-Louis Harris
poll, this one done on "America's
Changing Morality."
After a "weekend in Port
Alligator, Fla." the bogus Harris
and his staff found that most
Americans feel:
"A white grocer who sells
green tomatoes to a black
customer is worse than a White
Russian who sells red caviar on
the black market" and "94 per
cent believed that if God had
meant man to take drugs on the
street, He wouldn't have invented
drugstores."
