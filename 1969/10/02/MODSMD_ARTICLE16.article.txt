# Jobs Scarcer Next Summer

Summer employment
counseling, offered by the
Stanford Placement Service, faces
the perennial problem of helping
registered Stanford students find
summer work.
According to Mrs. Jane
Honikman, "many students
harbour the misunderstanding
that the employment counselor
can place them into a summer job.
This is not so."
She adds, however, that "a
counselor does assist the student
seeking summer employment by
providing information about
available job openings." In many
ways, the employment counselor
can serve the student only by
acting as a relay between students

and prospective employers who
list positions with the placement
office.
Last year, 458 positions wore
listed. Of that number, 97
students out of 1176 registered
were known to have accepted
jobs.
This low figure, though
somewhat misleading, reflects the
handicap which serving in an
advisory capacity imposes upon
the employment counselor.
Moreover, if "the government's
response to curb inflation
continues which there is every
indication it will, then next year's
summer employment situation
will be far worse than this
summer," states John Petty of the
California State Employment

Agency. "It seems somehow
inconceivable that there can be a
summer any worse than the one
we had," he concludes.
As less money is made available
to students to finance their
educations, there is a greater need
to provide higher paying jobs to
meet educational expenses. One
solution proposed by the
Placement Service is to persuade
students to attend the summer
quarter and work one of the other
three quarters when jobs are more
plentiful.
Another proposal emanating
from the Dean of Students Office
is for the University to provide
"seed" money in order that the
Placement Service may hire
students to recruit jobs for other
students.
