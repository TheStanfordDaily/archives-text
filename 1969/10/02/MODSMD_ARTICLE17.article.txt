# Freshman Odyssey

Ity ANDY ISRAKI.
Friday's Freshman colloquy
included three stimulating
lectures which served as feeding
troughs and gadflies for the
discussion groups which followed.
Had the discussions sprung from
the stuff they were made (if, they
would have been as witty, deep,
humorous, delightful, thought
provoking, and short as the
lectures.
Unfortunately the original
food for thought was altered
beyond recognition somewhere in
the digestive process, and the
discussions became a battleground
between those who would isolate
the academic community and
those who would integrate the
activities of the university into the
mailstream of society.
One particularly vehement
group member insisted the
university was to be a privileged
and separate entity. He had
already begun to build the walls
around himself.
* * *
By half-time I think that Katy
understood the ones in red and
white were the good guys and the
others played the role of
oppressors. 1 speculated it was my
curly locks or possibly my
glowing personality that kept her
gazes transfixed in my direction
throughout the game but the
bubble was burst when she
announced that she was watching
me in order to know when to
cheer, get excited, shout, stand
up, or be disappointed.
About halfway through the
first half, she realized that the

%/
wealth of statistics about downs,
yardage, score, and time was not
being tapped from my personal
well of information about the
gridiron but rather from the
scoreboard. At the point 1 feel I
suffered a definite loss of prestige.
* * *
NOTE: those interested in
meeting people the first days ol
school should take some of the
following advice:
Girls have the traditional
feminine devices of getting guys
to move trunks, show you where
electrical outlets are, move
furniture, etc. If you are a guy,
you can't very well ask some
sweet young thing to carry your
bags as a clever ploy to get her
into your room alone with you.
You could claim to not know
what to do with the washing
machine or the iron, but you had
better search for something you
are totally inept at if you expect
to win the game.
Bring two paint samples into a
girl's room. Ask her to come to
your room and give you her
opinion of which would blend in
with the structural pattern of the
decor the best. Naturally the
structure of your room is exactly
the same as the structure of her
room since it is just upstairs but
you hope that a certain academic
myopia will blind her to this fact.
What to do next is really not
appropriate for the Daily but
would fit better into a paper with
more space and wider perspective
of the new morality.

you can't very well ask some
sweet young thing to carry your
bags as a clever ploy to get her
into your room alone with you.
You could claim to not know
what to do with the washing
machine or the iron, but you had
better search for something you
are totally inept at if you expect
to win the game.
Bring two paint samples into a
girl's room. Ask her to come to
your room and give you her
opinion of which would blend in
with the structural pattern of the
decor the best. Naturally the
structure of your room is exactly
the same as the structure of her
room since it is just upstairs but
you hope that a certain academic
myopia will blind her to this fact.
What to do next is really not
appropriate for the Daily but
would fit better into a paper with
more space and wider perspective
of the new morality.

Friday's Freshman colloquy
included three stimulating
lectures which served as feeding
troughs and gadflies for the
discussion groups which followed.
Had the discussions sprung from
the stuff they were made (if, they
would have been as witty, deep,
humorous, delightful, thought
provoking, and short as the
lectures.
Unfortunately the original
food for thought was altered
beyond recognition somewhere in
the digestive process, and the
discussions became a battleground
between those who would isolate
the academic community and
those who would integrate the
activities of the university into the
mailstream of society.
One particularly vehement
group member insisted the
university was to be a privileged
and separate entity. He had
already begun to build the walls
around himself.

By half-time I think that Katy
understood the ones in red and
white were the good guys and the
others played the role of
oppressors. 1 speculated it was my
curly locks or possibly my
glowing personality that kept her
gazes transfixed in my direction
throughout the game but the
bubble was burst when she
announced that she was watching
me in order to know when to
cheer, get excited, shout, stand
up, or be disappointed.
About halfway through the
first half, she realized that the

%/
wealth of statistics about downs,
yardage, score, and time was not
being tapped from my personal
well of information about the
gridiron but rather from the
scoreboard. At the point 1 feel I
suffered a definite loss of prestige.

NOTE: those interested in
meeting people the first days ol
school should take some of the
following advice:
Girls have the traditional
feminine devices of getting guys
to move trunks, show you where
electrical outlets are, move
furniture, etc. If you are a guy,
you can't very well ask some
sweet young thing to carry your
bags as a clever ploy to get her
into your room alone with you.
