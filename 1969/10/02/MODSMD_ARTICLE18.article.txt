# Memories--Stanford's Last Student
## 
### JEREMY BAKER 
I am the last student of
Stanford University.
Even now, as I finish my last
paper (the last paper that will ever
be written at Stanford University)
they are taking away the books
and the desks, so that the
buildings may be put to a better
purpose.
Rotting professors have been
driven from their little rooms, and
have had to come back to sneak
out their filing cabinets in the
dead of night. Already the animals
are flooding the arched buildings,
and there are sheep grazing on the
I iwns. "What are they going to do
with the place now that we are
gone," the old men mutter as they
bend under the burden of their
papers. Perhaps they will be asked
back, they hope, and the
experiment will be forgotten.
I must hurry this work; the
documentation of the university is
being moved to a warehouse in
Sunnyvale, and I want to have my
degree certificate in my hand.
A truck drives by, taking a load
of hay into the main quad; only
animals are allowed their now,
and the cows wander through the
arches and rub themselves up
against the carved stone columns.
We must cut out our tongues, we
all agreed, and this evil place must
be cleansed of our words; only

silence can save these buildings,
we agreed at the great meeting,
and we went out from Memorial
Hall in silence.
There was no procession to
close down the university; we
were through with that, even
though some of us dreamed of a
column of stragglers marching off
into San Francisco. But the
farmers arrived one day, and
roughly established cow byres in
our offices, and we had no heart
for play-acting.
I regret it all, you know; in my
European way, I could not
condemn the cathedrals of
graduate schools that arose here,
and brought adolescents into this
monastic timeless life. And
tourists would come and look at
us, marvelling at the beautiful
uselessness of our activities.
The marvel was that it
happened so quickly, as if the
truth has established itself in each
person, long before we dared to
speak about it. And then it
happened, and there were farmers
everywhere who didn't care about
anything, not even the animals,
much.
Well, of course, my papers
were all inspired by Marshall
McLuhan, I can see it all now, and
no one ever said, Look here, This
is Inspired by Marshall McLuhan,
because of course no one would
even dare admit that they had
read Marshall McLuhan, even
though he is available in Playboy
magazine these days, and do you
know, I don't think I even
realized that my stuff was all
McLuhan anyway; no, its not as if
that guv is very clever anyway,
I'm not saying that, because I
really believe it to be a lie but in
fact there is a limit to the number
of correct sentences that anyone
can utter, and Marshall McLuhan
had liis share and more.
I can remember a word. There
was a picture of a water-works
dressed up as if it were the
Parthenon. That tells you
everything in McLuhan. All the
rest of the words were just an
attempt to get himself a Canada
Council Award, or the Governor
General's Prize for poetry, or even
the Governor General's prize for
humor (they really have such a
thing up there), because that is
the Canadian scene, and people in
Toronto gotta make the Canadian
scene.
The message, for those who
can't understand, is this;
everything is fucked up, and
things will have to be different;
there ain't no more in the

message, because all the rest is
dressing up (that's ironic, because
McLuhan dressed up his new
message in the old academic style,
exactly like Ibat water-works!!!).
You can put the past parentheses
in a footnote if you like, because
if this is the last paper written at
Stanford University, then we had
better go out in style.
Actually, I have a job here,
because 1 remembered from my
old days in the Fen country, in
England, that I could make cow
noises; I would arrive home from
London on Saturday morning,
and make this mooing noise, and
the cows would come racing over
(insofar as cows race), so this is a
talent that has a genuine use in
the new society; frankly, when
they want to have the cows all in
one place, for feeding or whatever
it is that cows do, then it is
cheaper and more manageable for
them to have me than it is to train
up some sheep-dogs.
Well, 1 had better finish this
paper (papers were such a drag,
weren't they?), because they are
waiting for me down at the office,
ready to hand over my inscribed
piece of paper; I think the old
ladies down there are going to
have a bit of a celebration, with
tea and buns and things, so I had
better not let them down. Let's
face it, I want my pieces of paper
too, they somehow lock me into
the old culture, as if 1 had an
eighteenth century uniform that 1
had actually been given in the
18 th century. (Talking of
memorabilia, there was a New
York auction the other day, at
which they had Napoleon's
penis—they had cut it. oft just
before burial—and someone
actually bought it; you can't
imagine anyone refusing,
considering that it is such a relic;
and so it is with my degree
certificates, of course, and like
Napoleon's penis, you are pleased
to have them, but you wouldn't
leave them lying around the
house!!!!!!)
In a funny kind of way, 1 want
to go on typing, because I know
that when I stop, then there won't
be any more Stanford University;
they really should have gotten a
15 year old to type the last paper,
and he would cough himself to
death, just like Mrs. Stanford's
baby-boy. Let's face it, they had a
good run for their money, and no
one begrudges them a thing.
I am now leaving so here goes:
OK, cows, OK, hens, it's all
your's now . . . .
