# Child Care Service Begins Next Week
## 
### 
An ad hoc group of students
and employees is in the process of
establishing the first cooperative
child care—nursery school in the
campus community.
The group, calling itself the
Stanford Community Children's

Center, has obtained the use of an
unused wing of the Children's
Convalescent Home and is
preparing to provide a
five-morning per week nursery
school beginning next Monday.
Successful organization of this
project will lead, hopefully, to a
full day care center —nursery
school later in the school year.
The group is a coalition of
Escondido Village parents who
participated in a highly successful
experimental summer program at
Stanford Elementary School and a
child care organization committee
composed of SLAC and other
Stanford employees. It was found
that there is a desperate need for
low cost child care and nursery
school service in the community
not only for financially pressed
students but for employees as
well.
The Center is presently
organized as a research project
sponsored by Professor Henry M.
Levin of the School of Education
with the hope that the center will
be fully licensed and located in a
permanent site on campus for the
next school year.
To quote from the group's
proposal, its goals are . . to
assess the development of a school
in which parents participate in
setting goals and policies for the
school which their children
attend. It is hoped that we can
ascertain the direction and
organization which allow
maximum parental involvement."
