## GOP Senators Nix Nominee 
### 
WASHINGTON (AP) Sen.
Robert P. Griffin, the No. 2
Republican in the Senate,
reportedly has suggested to
President Nixon that the Supreme
Court appointment of Judge
Clement F. Haynsworth be
withdrawn. A spokesman for the
Michigan senator Wednesday night
refused, however, to confirm or
deny the report that came from
several congressional sources.
The Griffin development came
on the heels of a public call by
another Republican senator,
Edward W. Brooke of
Massachusetts, that Nixon call
back the nomination or face an
"embarrassingly" close vote and
possibly even defeat.
There was no immediate
comment from the White House
on any possible withdrawal.
Nixon, however, said at his news
conference last week he had no
intention of pulling back his
nomination of Haynsworth, a
judge on the 4th U.S. Court of
Appeals.
Griffin, the newly selected
assistant Senate minority leader,
reportedly made his withdrawal
suggestion Tuesday during
Nixon's meeting with the
Republican congressional
leadership.

LOS ANGELES
(AP) -Chancellor Charles Young
refused Wednesday to bar
philosophy professor Angela
Davis — an avowed
Communist—from teaching a
class; and at the request of four
University of California regents, an
emergency board meeting, was set
for Friday.
Miss Davis, 25, was ordered
dismissed by the regents Sept. 1 9
on the grounds that longstanding
University regulations forbade the

hiring of Communist faculty
members.
Ponding her appeal of the
dismissal through university
personnel boards, Miss Davis was
to remain a full-fledged faculty
member not scheduled to teach
until UCLA's winter quarter,
which follows the one just
beginning.
Last week, philosophy
department chairman Donald
Kalish appointed Miss Davis, a
Negro, to teach "Recurring
Philosophical Themes in Black
Literature" when a vacancy
occurred.
The appointment incensed
Regent John Canaday, who
telegranimed UC President Charles
Hitch he would summon an

emergency regents meeting to
consider the philosophy
department's "defiance" if Miss
Davis were not removed.
Hitch flew to Los Angeles late
Tuesday to confer with Young,
and the chancellor told newsmen
Wednesday he would "oppose any
attempts to suspend Miss Davis or
get her out of the classroom."
Later some 400 members of
the Academic Senate met on the
UCLA campus and passed
resolutions supporting Miss
Davis's right to teach pending her
appeal.
The faculty body also voted to
rescind its endorsement 20 years
ago of the UC policy forbidding
the employment of Communists.
A spokesman said many faculty

members though 1 the o \ policy
had been superset, u . m, ago, but
voted to erase twe old
endorsement "so there would be
no doubt in anyone's mind how
the faculty stands."
Thirty-four of California's 120
legislators yesterday supported
the firing of a woman philosophy
professor at UCLA because she
admitted being a Communist.
Three Democrats and 31
Republicans joined in the
telegram to University of
California regents who fired Miss
Angela Davis.
The telegram also deplored her
assignment to teach at the school
pending the outcome of her
administrative appeals of the
dismissal. The lawmakers said it is
time to show the people that the
university "is under control of the
regents and not the faculty."
