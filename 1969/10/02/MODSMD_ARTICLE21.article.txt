# Endowment To Historian
## 
### 
Prof. Gordon A. Craig, an
internationally known German
historian, has been chosen the
first recipient of the J.E. Wallace
Sterling endowed professorship in
the humanities.
The Sterling professorship was
created in June 1968 by the
Board of Trustees in honor of Dr.
Sterling, who resigned after 19
years as Stanford's president to
become life-time chancellor of the
University.
The Craig appointment, the
trustees noted, is particularly
appropriate since Dr. Sterling
himself is an authority on British
history and "Prof. Craig's major
field of scholarship is very close to
that of Dr. Sterling."
Prof. Craig, at Stanford since
1961, was educated through the
doctorate at Princeton University
and was a Rhodes scholar at
Oxford in 1938. He taught history
at Princeton both before and after
World War 11.
He is a frequent book reviewer
for The New York Times
Magazine, and in addition is the
author of many scholarly articles
in professional journals.
