## Scouting Report 
### FRED MANN 
(Third in a six pari series)
No matter how many surprises pop up in the Pacific-8 Rose Bowl
race this year, it seems only an earthquake will keep a California team
out of Pasadena next January 1. The top four contenders all reside in
the Gold State, and the two Oregon schools art* only longshots.
That leaves only Washington and Washington State, neither of
which will pose much of a threat to anybody. Washington is just not
the same old power it used to be, and the Cougars are still the
non-power they always were.
WASHINGTON HUSKIES
Seattle used to be Jim Owens country. He owned the town from
September to December, and consistently turned out the toughest,
most physical, and most successful football team on the coast. A
hard-line, determined man, Owens pushed his team hard and got
results. But today, he is finding things as difficult as OSU's Dee
Andros.
The Washington BSU took exception to Owens' brand of
discipline, and the team trainer was accused of making racial remarks.
The whole program was shaken. So Owens fired the trainer, hired a
black assistant, and loosened up on his discipline. The result was a
much more relaxed team, a happier atmosphere, and losing seasons.
Last year the Huskies finished 3-5-2, the worst record for Owens in
the last ten years. This go-round, the football should be better,
although the record may be much the same. The team has improved in
most departments, but Washington faces the toughest schedule of any
Pac-8 school.
Already they have met and lost to Michigan State and Michigan,
and Saturday they draw Ohio State, the nation's top team. After that
it's seven league games in a row including away games at USC and
Stanford. If they can survive till the end of the season, it will be a
major miracle.
Running back Harvey Blanks is back after an ankle injury in the
spring, but he will be limited for a few weeks. He should lead in
rushing and receiving. Bo Cornell should be a top runner at fullback.
Quarterback Gene Willis is a team captain but doesn't have too much
to direct. The offensive line is bigger and stronger this year with Augie
Rios a fine senior tackle anchoring the group. The receiving corps is
very limited.
The Huskies have no depth on defense, and the deep backs are all
gone. Linebacker Clyde Werner is the key. He is great. The front four
are Washington-big.
Predicted finish: 7th place.
WASHINGTON STATE
The Cougars are the weakest team in a strong league. Their upset
opening game win over Illinois may end up being the highlight of the
whole season. The offensive line and defensive backs are
inexperienced, but other departments appear strong. The only
problem for WSU is that the other Pac-8 teams are even stronger.
Quarterback is up for grabs with little Chuck Hawthorne (5-9, 165)
doing most of the grabbing. He runs well but is questionable through
Lhe air. Bob (Baby Bull) Evven leads a fine stable of runners, while
flanker Johnny Davis and newcomer Brock Aynsley form a quick and
sure-handed pass catching duo. The defensive line, adequate last year,
returns almost intact.
Predicted finish: 8th place.

Pac-8 school.
Already they have met and lost to Michigan State and Michigan,
and Saturday they draw Ohio State, the nation's top team. After that
it's seven league games in a row including away games at USC and
Stanford. If they can survive till the end of the season, it will be a
major miracle.
Running back Harvey Blanks is back after an ankle injury in the
spring, but he will be limited for a few weeks. He should lead in
rushing and receiving. Bo Cornell should be a top runner at fullback.
Quarterback Gene Willis is a team captain but doesn't have too much
to direct. The offensive line is bigger and stronger this year with Augie
Rios a fine senior tackle anchoring the group. The receiving corps is
very limited.
The Huskies have no depth on defense, and the deep backs are all
gone. Linebacker Clyde Werner is the key. He is great. The front four
are Washington-big.
Predicted finish: 7th place.
WASHINGTON STATE
The Cougars are the weakest team in a strong league. Their upset
opening game win over Illinois may end up being the highlight of the
whole season. The offensive line and defensive backs are
inexperienced, but other departments appear strong. The only
problem for WSU is that the other Pac-8 teams are even stronger.
Quarterback is up for grabs with little Chuck Hawthorne (5-9, 165)
doing most of the grabbing. He runs well but is questionable through
Lhe air. Bob (Baby Bull) Evven leads a fine stable of runners, while
flanker Johnny Davis and newcomer Brock Aynsley form a quick and
sure-handed pass catching duo. The defensive line, adequate last year,
returns almost intact.
Predicted finish: 8th place.
(Third in a six pari series)
No matter how many surprises pop up in the Pacific-8 Rose Bowl
race this year, it seems only an earthquake will keep a California team
out of Pasadena next January 1. The top four contenders all reside in
the Gold State, and the two Oregon schools art* only longshots.
That leaves only Washington and Washington State, neither of
which will pose much of a threat to anybody. Washington is just not
the same old power it used to be, and the Cougars are still the
non-power they always were.
WASHINGTON HUSKIES
Seattle used to be Jim Owens country. He owned the town from
September to December, and consistently turned out the toughest,
most physical, and most successful football team on the coast. A
hard-line, determined man, Owens pushed his team hard and got
results. But today, he is finding things as difficult as OSU's Dee
Andros.
The Washington BSU took exception to Owens' brand of
discipline, and the team trainer was accused of making racial remarks.
The whole program was shaken. So Owens fired the trainer, hired a
black assistant, and loosened up on his discipline. The result was a
much more relaxed team, a happier atmosphere, and losing seasons.
Last year the Huskies finished 3-5-2, the worst record for Owens in
the last ten years. This go-round, the football should be better,
although the record may be much the same. The team has improved in
most departments, but Washington faces the toughest schedule of any
Pac-8 school.
