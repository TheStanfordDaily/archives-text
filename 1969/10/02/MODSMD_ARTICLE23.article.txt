# Water Polo Opens Vs. LBCC Today
## 
### DON TOLLEFSON 
This year's sophomore-ridden
Stanford varsity water polo team
has high hopes of not only
improving on last year's dismal
season but of also challenging for
the Pacific-8 championship.
Coach Jim Gaughran was
extremely pleased at Stanford's
second place finish in last
weekend's eight team UC Irvine
tournament. The Indians pulled
off major upsets by dumping both
Irvine and California. Their only
loss came to UCLA in the
tournament finals, 10-2.
Gaughran was especially
pleased with the performance of
two sophomores Rick Massimino
and Peter Gadd.
Since only four teams play
water polo in the Pac-8, Gaughran
admits that UCLA is Stanford's
main concern, but he also says

that both Cal and USC are still
formidable and in his words, "We
play in a pretty well balanced four
team league." Outside of league
play, Stanford's biggest
competition will come on October
18 against San Jose State.
Last year the Spartans were
unofficial national champions and
they should provide a stiff test for
the young Stanford team. Of
more immediate concern to
Gaughran is this afternoon's home
opener against Long Beach City
College. Coincidentally the
Indians will also face LBCC in the
opening round of this weekend's
Northern California Invitational
Tournament at Foothill College.
If Stanford can advance in the
tournament they will face a strong
De Anza Aquatic Club team led
by former Stanford and Olympic
star Gary Sheerer.
Although there are 11
sophomores on the 17 man squad,
Gaughran expects Stanford to be
a serious contender for the Pac-8
title and he hopes Stanford might
make it to the first ever NCAA
championshps in Long Beach
November 28 and 29.
