# Big Ten Power
## Boilermakers Prepare 
### GREG JACOBS 
The Stanford football team
travels to Lafayette, Indiana to
meet Purdue for the first time
ever. Purdue quarterback, Mike
Phipps, led the Boilermakers to
their third consecutive victory
over Notre Dame last weekend.
Phipps is the only quarterback in
college history to beat the
Fighting Irish three times. He has
a total offense of 622 yards in
Purdue's first two games this
season. Their team offense ranks
seventh in the nation with 498.5
yards per game (Stanford third
with an average of 556 yards per
game.)
Although the Boilermakers lost
All-American Leroy Keyes from
last year's team, they have 29
returning lettermen. Purdue's
strength lies in their defense
where eight starters from last year
return to make things difficult for
any opponent's offense. Purdue
had a fine 8-2 record last season,
and were 5-2 in the Big Ten for a
third place finish in that tough
conference.
Stanford carries a five-game
winning streak over the last two
seasons into Saturday's game—the
longest streak since 1955-56
seasons. Under Coach Ralson the
Indians have built a 10-4-1
win-loss record over intersectional
teams in the seven years he has
been at Stanford. He'll be looking
for win number 11 Saturday.
Quarterback Jim Plunkett and
halfback Howie Williams lead the
Stanford offense against Purdue.
Plunkett is averaging over .200
yards per game passing for the
first two games, and Williams
leads the team in rushing with 154
yards at 4.5 yards per carry. After
Williams, Jackie Brown has gained
121 yards, and Bubba Brown has
rushed for 109 yards at an
outstanding 8.2 yards per carry.
Don Parish, and Pat Preston,
two hard-nosed linebackers, back
up the Stanford defensive line.
The line showed a newly-found
strength against Oregon, limiting
the Ducks to 30 yards rushing.
Stanford pass defenders are an

aggressive, experienced group who
make it tough to score through
the air against the Tribe.
The Indians boast a
well-balanced offense, averaging
274 yards on the ground and 283
yards in the air per game, but they
will meet their most difficult test
so far this season against Purdue.
The Boilermakers' big but
extremely quick defensive line
limited Notre Dame to only two
touchdowns last week, one

coming in the final moments of
the game.
However, if Stanford's passing
game remains effective, it can
neutralize the strong Purdue line,
and even open it up for the
Indians' hard-running backfield.
Purdue coach Jack Mollenkopf
worries his team may suffer a
let-down after its easy win over
Notre Dame. Stanford head coach
John Ralston hopes "they have
one helluva let-down."

rushed for 109 yards at an
outstanding 8.2 yards per carry.
Don Parish, and Pat Preston,
two hard-nosed linebackers, back
up the Stanford defensive line.
The line showed a newly-found
strength against Oregon, limiting

Stanford pass defenders are an

aggressive, experienced group who
make it tough to score through
the air against the Tribe.
The Indians boast a
well-balanced offense, averaging
274 yards on the ground and 283
yards in the air per game, but they
will meet their most difficult test
so far this season against Purdue.
The Boilermakers' big but
extremely quick defensive line
limited Notre Dame to only two
touchdowns last week, one

coming in the final moments of
the game.
However, if Stanford's passing
game remains effective, it can
neutralize the strong Purdue line,
and even open it up for the
Indians' hard-running backfield.
Purdue coach Jack Mollenkopf
worries his team may suffer a
let-down after its easy win over

one helluva let-down."

The Stanford football team
travels to Lafayette, Indiana to
meet Purdue for the first time
ever. Purdue quarterback, Mike
Phipps, led the Boilermakers to
their third consecutive victory
over Notre Dame last weekend.
Phipps is the only quarterback in
college history to beat the
Fighting Irish three times. He has
a total offense of 622 yards in
Purdue's first two games this
season. Their team offense ranks
seventh in the nation with 498.5
yards per game (Stanford third
with an average of 556 yards per
game.)
Although the Boilermakers lost
All-American Leroy Keyes from
last year's team, they have 29
returning lettermen. Purdue's
strength lies in their defense
where eight starters from last year
return to make things difficult for
any opponent's offense. Purdue
had a fine 8-2 record last season,
and were 5-2 in the Big Ten for a
third place finish in that tough
conference.
Stanford carries a five-game
winning streak over the last two
seasons into Saturday's game—the
longest streak since 1955-56
seasons. Under Coach Ralson the
Indians have built a 10-4-1
win-loss record over intersectional
teams in the seven years he has
been at Stanford. He'll be looking
for win number 11 Saturday.
Quarterback Jim Plunkett and
halfback Howie Williams lead the
Stanford offense against Purdue.
Plunkett is averaging over .200
yards per game passing for the
first two games, and Williams
leads the team in rushing with 154
yards at 4.5 yards per carry. After
Williams, Jackie Brown has gained
121 yards, and Bubba Brown has
rushed for 109 yards at an
outstanding 8.2 yards per carry.
