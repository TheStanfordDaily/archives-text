# Quakes Shake Bay Area
## 
### 
Two earthquakes jolted a large
area of Northern California
Wednesday night, reportedly
causing several injuries from flying
glass.
The two quakes were centered
five miles north of Santa Rosa, a
city of about 50,000 located 60
miles north of San Francisco.
The sheriff's office in Santa
Rosa said numerous persons were
hurt by flying glass but there were
no immediate reports of fatalities.
Conflicting reports came from the
Santa Rosa I'ress Democrat, which
claimed no knowledge of injuries.
Most downtown Santa Rosa
store windows were shattered, the
sheriff's office said, but
"everything is under control."
The first jolt, at 9:56 p.m.,
registered 4.8 on the Richter
Scale. The second shock came at
11:19 p.m., reaching 5.6 on the
scale.

The earthquakes jiggled tall
buildings in downtown San
Francisco and shook communities
within a radius of at least 75
miles. Most downtown Santa Rosa
store windows were shattered, and
numerous walls on buildings
cracked. Phone service and power
was cut off to half the city.
At Stanford the campus police
office was flooded with phone
calls, but no damage or injuries
were reported.
Students studying in the
Undergraduate Library reported
that "the building rocked back
and forth for about half a
minute."
One bed in Rinconada, Wilbur
Hall, reportedly was shifted
several inches by the shock.
A number of students thought
the quake was related to the
bomb tests in the Aleutian
Islands. The first test is not
scheduled to begin until today.
