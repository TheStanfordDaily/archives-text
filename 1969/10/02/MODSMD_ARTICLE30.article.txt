## Tutoring & Drama 
### 
An experimental course
offering community involvement
with academic credit will be open
this fall for students interested in
tutoring high school minority
students. Undergraduate Special
181, conceived by Jim Bower, a
Stanford student in Economics,
provides for the education of both
the tutors and their students in
the area of interracial relations.
Those enrolling in the course
will be working on a one to one
basis with minority students in
grades 9-12 at Gunn High School
and Terman Junior High School.
The first meeting of the course
will be held on October 6 in room
164 in the Undergraduate Library.
Students who wish to
participate in the tutoring but do
not want to take the course can
apply for a tutoring post at the
education office in Cubberly.
The Company, Stanford's
undergraduate drama group, is

holding tryouts tomorrow and
Sunday for its fall quarter
production, "The Caucasian Chalk
Circle" by Bertolt Brecht. The
play will be directed by John
Davis, a senior in Speech and
Drama. Tryouts will be held in
Toyon Lounge at 4:00 p.m. and
at 7:30 p.m. on Sunday.
The Company, now in its
fourth year, is noted for having
introduced free undergraduate
drama to the residences and
courtyards of Stanford, and has
done a great deal of work in
Memorial Church. In addition to
the Medieval mystery plays of its
early years, the group has
successfully produced modern
plays such as "The Visit," "The
Devils," and the spectacular
"Marat Sade." Actors, musicians,
singers, and tech people are
needed for this quarter's show,
and everyone who tries out is
welcome to work.
