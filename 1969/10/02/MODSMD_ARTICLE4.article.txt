# Nixon Executive Order: Grad Students Deferred
## 
### 
President Nixon announced
yesterday that all dral't-eligible
graduate students who do
satisfactory work during the
current school year will be safe
from induction until next June.
The change in policy (present
rules allow the student to delay
induction only until the end of
the academic semester)
technically took the form of a
recommendation from the
National Security Council to the
Selective Service System.
The recommendation stated:
"In courses of graduate study, an

interruption at the end of a term,
other than the final term of the
academic year, is costly to the
student in terms of expenses and
academic progress and therefore
contrary to the national interest."
The NSC recommendation is sure
to be adopted. »
At Stanford, student and
administrative reactions to the
reprieve was mixed. Some were
exuberant. Vice Provost Howie
Brooks said, "That's just
tremendously good news. It is
going to help the graduate
students' work. This is good news
for both the university and the
community."
Barry Askinas, former
president of the Graduate Student
Association and now ASSU
Co-President, agreed. "Whoopee,"
he said. "It removes a great deal
of uncertainty from the lives of
graduate students."
However, Askinas was quick to
add, "But it in no way lessens the
need to bring the Vietnam war to
an end. Only in this way can all
young people find relief from the
inequities of the draft."
Askinas' reservations were
common. Bill Leland, former
director of the Special Services
Department underlined
difficulties in the new rules.
"Any reform of this type,
working to the favor of one group
naturally hurts another. One thing
the college student must learn is
that he is privileged. The draft
intimidates those who are
uninformed. In this atmosphere of
intimidation the less educated
bear the brunt of the burden."
"Because of the new rules, the
younger, less vocal, less malleable
will be hurt even more until June.
Reform of this kind is really

deceit —not intentioned, mind
you—but deceit nonetheless. Still,
I am happy with the change. It
helps individuals —and that's what
I'm interested in."
Most other top administrators
were cautious, but also happy for
the graduate students.
Vice-President and Provost
Richard Lyman said, "It is a
welcome decrease in the
uncertainties of graduate students;
though ' it scarcely answers the
question of the nation's
direction."
Lincoln Moses, the Graduate
Dean added, "I don't believe we
should have a draft—that is aside
from nation emergencies. But this
does help graduate students."
President Nixon's action was
the third in a series of draft
reform announcements intended
at easing student resistance to the
draft.
Previous Presidential
statements have cancelled the
November and December draft
calls and announced that if

Congress does not act to institute
the lottery, the President will.
Still, Stanford opinion was
undivided: if the President intends
to cool the campuses by these
changes he is wrongheaded.
Lyman said, "He's (Nixon)
made partial, bit by bit decisions
in the past few weeks; and its hard
to see what direction they all
point in. The fact remains that the
war is there. And as long as it is, it
is difficult to see how there can be
a secure future."
Paul Rupert, a member of the
Resistance, went a bit further.
"Resistance is up all over the
country. It is so high that they are
only going to be able to prosecute
one-third of the resistors.
"It is clear that the war is going
to continue. The university is still
important to American
imperialism. They're just pulling
this shit too late. Everyone is
telling Nixon that the draft is
causing radicalism. But that's just
not the problem. I'm not any less
mad at imperialism on the campus
this week than last. Are you?"
