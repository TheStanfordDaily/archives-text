# Classes Crowded
## 
### 
An unprecedented swamping
of popular courses occured
yesterday, the first day of classes,
following a substantial
liberalization of University course
requirements.
Overcrowding forced many
classes to move from their
originally assigned rooms to larger
halls or auditoriums.
The most outstanding example
of overcrowding occured when
700 students filled the seats,
aisles, and stage of the 420-seat

lower floor of Cubberly
Auditorium to attend Prof. John
Gurley's General Economics
course.
Anthropology Prof. Bert
Gerow resorted to holding his
Development of Man course in the
inner quad when 240 students
showed up in a room meant for
40.
Other Classes Crowded
Other unusually crowded
classes included Comparative
Urbanism taught by St. Clair
Drake, new head of the
Afro-American Studies program.
In that course 150 students
showed up for 50 places. In
Comparative Economic Systems,
taught by Gurley, the anticipated
enrollment doubled; and in a
Russian course on Dostoevsky,
140 people jammed a small
classroom.
The relaxation of University
course requirements, particularly
those for freshmen, who are no

longer required to take Western
Civilization and as much
Freshman English, is cited as the
major reason for the unexpected
attendance at many classes.
Assistant Registrar and
Recorder Walter Findeisen
suggested that the overcrowding
of some classes was due to the
increased political awareness of
the campus after last Spring's
disruptions. Socio-politically
oriented courses seemed to receive
the most enthusiastic response
from the students yesterday.
New Awareness
Classroom overcrowding has
caused a new awareness of a
shortage of classroom space on
campus. The available space has
not been substantially increased in
recent years.

The Registrar's office also
reported that through noon
Wednesday a total of 10,932
students had enrolled for the fall
quarter, a drop of 110 from last
year. It is anticipated, however,
that total enrollment will reach
11,500.
The total registered includes
6,152 undergraduates, an increase
of 207 from 1968, and 4,780
graduate students, a drop of 317.
With 4,164 men and 1,988
women undergraduates registered,
Stanford men have discovered
that the famed Stanford "ratio"
has fallenâ€”to about 2.1 men for
every woman, by far the lowest in
recent years. To many this has
brought the startling realization
that each man now has
three-tenths more woman.
