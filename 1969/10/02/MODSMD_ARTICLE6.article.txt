# Local SDS Takes New Tack
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Steel mills and picket lines,
community organizing, a chaotic
Chicago convention—such was the
fare of Stanford's Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) last
summer.
With several familiar faces
missing, the group will translate
those experiences into a diversity
of interests this^fall.
Four members, reluctant to
have their names published,
outlined for The Daily what
directions the chapter may take.
Ecology and land use and
women's liberation will be added
to the usual emphasis on
defending "political" prisoners
and opposing imperialism. In

addition, cooperation with
workers seems to be assuming
particular importance.
SDS has banked heavily on
supporting labor all summer. Two
members rated the two key
summer projects as participating
in a strike against Dow Chemical
Company and organizing
demonstrations against big
business's International Industrial
Conference.
Steel Strike
Their latest major thrust has
been in support of a strike against
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel
Company (PDM) in Santa Clara.
One SDSer explained that
Steelworkers' Local 4028 is
legally allowed only four pickets
and cannot ask for help, "but
they are very appreciative when
we come down." SDS has
concentrated action on Monday
morning rush hours, hoping to
gather enough people to block
entrances to the PDM plant and
keep "scabs" from working.
A number of Stanford SDSers
turned to factory work for the
summer, and several are
continuing this work while
organizing laborers.
Builds Understanding
This' type of activity, they
believe, builds understanding and
alliances between student radicals
and the working class. "Students
don't really know what workers
are about, and workers don't
really know what students are
about," one member commented.
He said, "The International
Industrial Conference

demonstrations really changed
peoples' heads" by showing
workers that students support
them. Students have also learned
much from workers, particularly
about collective bargaining
techniques, he said.
SDS has not forgotten students
amidst helping labor. A second
edition of last year's guide to area
entertainment and politics will
soon be available.
Organizing Students
Some former Stanford students
are organizing in high schools or
attending California junior
colleges. Some have "gone East to
school and are doing 'movement'
work there." Others will be
teaching this year.
Although as many as 20
members may have left, SDSers
feel confident in attracting
support. They point to the large
numbers of students involved in
last spring's April Third
Movement, directed primarily
against the Stanford Research
Institute. The chapter is anxious
to erase its elitist stigma and
enlarge membership—a likely
accomplishment if the 300 at
Tuesday's meeting is indicative.
Turbulent Convention
Concepts of the relationship
between students, workers and a
revolution were of key
importance at the SDS national
convention in Chicago. About 25
from Stanford attended the
turbulent gathering.
Stanford SDS did not mesh
with the Progressive Labor faction
(PL-WSA) which "sees the

primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class," according to
Leonard Siegal in yesterday's
Daily. Neither did many Stanford
SDSers accept the Weatherman
faction's analysis, which says
students and white workers
should primarily support black
and Third World revolutionary
struggles.
More Stanford students
sympathized with the
Revolutionary Youth Movement
II (RYM II) which Siegal
explained "views imperialism as
the 'major contradiction today,'
but does not conceive a revolution
without working class leadership."
Less Control
Most Stanford members,
however, favored less central
control than any of these three
factions.
The predominant reaction was
disappointment in the national
convention. "Irresponsible things
were being pushed," one member
said. "We went to describe the
April Third Movement and the
lessons we had learned, but this
was almost impossible among the
split."
Members did discuss last
ipring's events with individuals.
"Many thought it was a really
good struggle," one SDSer related.
"They especially liked the affinity
groups (small discussion-action
groups) and the carnival—the
emphasis on cultural as well as
political things."
Most left Chicago "with a sense
of respect about our own
chapter," one member
commented. "We felt we were
pretty good SDS people."
Stanford has since joined the
Northern California SDS Regional
Organization, which includes
RYM II and other deccntralist and
uncommitted elements.
The chapter will now face
defining its relationship to
factions of the national group.
But it does not see the national
split as having great affect on SDS
potency in this area. "We are
known locally for our
autonomous actions," one
member explained.

primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class," according to
Leonard Siegal in yesterday's
Daily. Neither did many Stanford
SDSers accept the Weatherman
faction's analysis, which says
students and white workers
should primarily support black
and Third World revolutionary
struggles.
More Stanford students
sympathized with the
Revolutionary Youth Movement
II (RYM II) which Siegal
explained "views imperialism as
the 'major contradiction today,'
but does not conceive a revolution
without working class leadership."
Less Control
Most Stanford members,
however, favored less central
control than any of these three
factions.
The predominant reaction was
disappointment in the national
convention. "Irresponsible things
were being pushed," one member
said. "We went to describe the
April Third Movement and the
lessons we had learned, but this
was almost impossible among the
split."
Members did discuss last
ipring's events with individuals.
"Many thought it was a really
good struggle," one SDSer related.
"They especially liked the affinity
groups (small discussion-action
groups) and the carnival—the
emphasis on cultural as well as
political things."
Most left Chicago "with a sense
of respect about our own
chapter," one member
commented. "We felt we were
pretty good SDS people."
Stanford has since joined the
Northern California SDS Regional
Organization, which includes
RYM II and other deccntralist and
uncommitted elements.
The chapter will now face
defining its relationship to
factions of the national group.
But it does not see the national
split as having great affect on SDS
potency in this area. "We are
known locally for our
autonomous actions," one
member explained.
Steel mills and picket lines,
community organizing, a chaotic
Chicago convention—such was the
fare of Stanford's Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) last
summer.
With several familiar faces
missing, the group will translate
those experiences into a diversity
of interests this^fall.
Four members, reluctant to
have their names published,
outlined for The Daily what
directions the chapter may take.
Ecology and land use and
women's liberation will be added
to the usual emphasis on
defending "political" prisoners
and opposing imperialism. In

addition, cooperation with
workers seems to be assuming
particular importance.
SDS has banked heavily on
supporting labor all summer. Two
members rated the two key
summer projects as participating
in a strike against Dow Chemical
Company and organizing
demonstrations against big
business's International Industrial
Conference.
Steel Strike
Their latest major thrust has
been in support of a strike against
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel
Company (PDM) in Santa Clara.
One SDSer explained that
Steelworkers' Local 4028 is
legally allowed only four pickets
and cannot ask for help, "but
they are very appreciative when
we come down." SDS has
concentrated action on Monday
morning rush hours, hoping to
gather enough people to block
entrances to the PDM plant and
keep "scabs" from working.
A number of Stanford SDSers
turned to factory work for the
summer, and several are
continuing this work while
organizing laborers.
Builds Understanding
This' type of activity, they
believe, builds understanding and
alliances between student radicals
and the working class. "Students
don't really know what workers
are about, and workers don't
really know what students are
about," one member commented.
He said, "The International
Industrial Conference

demonstrations really changed
peoples' heads" by showing
workers that students support
them. Students have also learned
much from workers, particularly
about collective bargaining
techniques, he said.
SDS has not forgotten students
amidst helping labor. A second
edition of last year's guide to area
entertainment and politics will
soon be available.
Organizing Students
Some former Stanford students
are organizing in high schools or
attending California junior
colleges. Some have "gone East to
school and are doing 'movement'
work there." Others will be
teaching this year.
Although as many as 20
members may have left, SDSers
feel confident in attracting
support. They point to the large
numbers of students involved in
last spring's April Third
Movement, directed primarily
against the Stanford Research
Institute. The chapter is anxious
to erase its elitist stigma and
enlarge membership—a likely
accomplishment if the 300 at
Tuesday's meeting is indicative.

keep "scabs" from working.
A number of Stanford SDSers
turned to factory work for the
summer, and several are
continuing this work while
organizing laborers.
Builds Understanding
This' type of activity, they
believe, builds understanding and
alliances between student radicals
and the working class. "Students
don't really know what workers
are about, and workers don't
really know what students are
about," one member commented.
He said, "The International
Industrial Conference

demonstrations really changed
peoples' heads" by showing
workers that students support
them. Students have also learned
much from workers, particularly
about collective bargaining
techniques, he said.
SDS has not forgotten students
amidst helping labor. A second
edition of last year's guide to area
entertainment and politics will
soon be available.
Organizing Students
Some former Stanford students
are organizing in high schools or
attending California junior
colleges. Some have "gone East to
school and are doing 'movement'
work there." Others will be
teaching this year.
Although as many as 20
members may have left, SDSers
feel confident in attracting
support. They point to the large
numbers of students involved in
last spring's April Third
Movement, directed primarily
against the Stanford Research
Institute. The chapter is anxious
to erase its elitist stigma and
enlarge membership—a likely
accomplishment if the 300 at
Tuesday's meeting is indicative.
Turbulent Convention
Concepts of the relationship
between students, workers and a
revolution were of key
importance at the SDS national
convention in Chicago. About 25
from Stanford attended the
turbulent gathering.
Stanford SDS did not mesh
with the Progressive Labor faction
(PL-WSA) which "sees the

primary contradiction in the
World today is between the
capitalist ruling class and the
working class," according to
Leonard Siegal in yesterday's
Daily. Neither did many Stanford
SDSers accept the Weatherman
faction's analysis, which says
students and white workers
should primarily support black
and Third World revolutionary
struggles.
More Stanford students
sympathized with the
Revolutionary Youth Movement
II (RYM II) which Siegal
explained "views imperialism as
the 'major contradiction today,'
but does not conceive a revolution
without working class leadership."
Less Control
Most Stanford members,
however, favored less central
control than any of these three
factions.
The predominant reaction was
disappointment in the national
convention. "Irresponsible things
were being pushed," one member
said. "We went to describe the
April Third Movement and the
lessons we had learned, but this
was almost impossible among the
split."
Members did discuss last
ipring's events with individuals.
"Many thought it was a really
good struggle," one SDSer related.
"They especially liked the affinity
groups (small discussion-action
groups) and the carnival—the
emphasis on cultural as well as
political things."
Most left Chicago "with a sense
of respect about our own
chapter," one member
commented. "We felt we were
pretty good SDS people."
Stanford has since joined the
Northern California SDS Regional
Organization, which includes
RYM II and other deccntralist and
uncommitted elements.
The chapter will now face
defining its relationship to
factions of the national group.
But it does not see the national
split as having great affect on SDS
potency in this area. "We are
known locally for our
autonomous actions," one
member explained.
Steel mills and picket lines,
community organizing, a chaotic
Chicago convention—such was the
fare of Stanford's Students for a
Democratic Society (SDS) last
summer.
With several familiar faces
missing, the group will translate
those experiences into a diversity
of interests this^fall.
Four members, reluctant to
have their names published,
outlined for The Daily what
directions the chapter may take.
Ecology and land use and
women's liberation will be added
to the usual emphasis on
defending "political" prisoners
and opposing imperialism. In

addition, cooperation with
workers seems to be assuming
particular importance.
SDS has banked heavily on
supporting labor all summer. Two
members rated the two key
summer projects as participating
in a strike against Dow Chemical
Company and organizing
demonstrations against big
business's International Industrial
Conference.
Steel Strike
Their latest major thrust has
been in support of a strike against
Pittsburgh-Des Moines Steel
Company (PDM) in Santa Clara.
One SDSer explained that
Steelworkers' Local 4028 is
legally allowed only four pickets
and cannot ask for help, "but
they are very appreciative when
we come down." SDS has
concentrated action on Monday
morning rush hours, hoping to
gather enough people to block
entrances to the PDM plant and
keep "scabs" from working.
