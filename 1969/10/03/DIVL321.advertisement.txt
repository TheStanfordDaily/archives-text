Suitcase
DrMH K KLH Model Eleven stereo
phonograph is the first portable
you can take with you and take
seriously.
The Model Eleven lets you take
high-performance stereo wherever
there is an AC outlet. It will fill a dorm room, a
summer cottage, or the living room back home
with the kind of sound once available only from a
massive and expensive gp* 1 111111 um^
sound-system.
Built around a remark- H
able pair of miniature
KLH speakers, the Model
Eleven provides a solid
bass response unmatched by many big consoles.
Its electronics are "contoured" to provide just the
amount of power needed by the speakers at vari
ous frequencies, and they provide enough power
overall to fill a big living room or a small house.
The automatic turntable is built to KLH specifi
cations by Garrard, and is equipped with a Picker
ing cartridge with a diamond stylus. There's a full
I
array of controls, inputs for a tuner or tape
recorder, and enough speaker cord to put the
speakers wherever you want them.
All of this comes—and goes—in a handsome lug
gage case of vinyl Contourlite that will slip under
a jetliner seat. It weighs only 28 pounds ready to
travel.
So take the KLH stereo suitcase along. It will
give you musical pleasure out of all proportion to
its size, weight, and cost.
