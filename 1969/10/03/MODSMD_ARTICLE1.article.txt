# English Class "Disrupted"
## 'Who Are You, Prof?' 
### FRED MANN 
"Who gives you the right to tell
us the class will meet on Monday,
Wednesday, and Thursday?"
A bewildered Assistant Pro
fessor Larry Friedlander could
only smile when asked the ques
tion in his Contemporary Drama
class yesterday. Instead of trying
to answer, he began his lecture for
the second day's class. But he
could not get very far. Another
voice from the back of Cubberley
demanded, "Why do you tell us
what to read? Man, come down
and rap with us. Make this class
exciting."
The 250 class members began
to stir. You just don't talk to a
prof like that. Heads turned to see
the intruder. Friedlander again
offered to begin the lecture.
"Listen, we all took this class
because it could be something
special," someone said, "and now
you're trying to just open our
heads and pour facts in. Let's talk
and think." Voices rang out.

"Shut up and let him talk."
The professor appeared upset.
"You do need information.
You need knowledge,"
Friedlander said quietly.
Two others joined the oppo
sition. "Why?" they yelled. "Who
are you to tell us that?" Freshmen
were amazed. Sophomores went
into shock.
"Listen, I'm sorry that you're
upset," said Friedlander, "but I
don't know what you want me to
do. I have to educate as well as
study education. That's the sys
tem. "
"The system is bullshit,"
screamed another. "You don't
even try to change the stupid
system."
Now the class was in a general
uproar. Lines had been drawn.
The first questioning student
walked out yelling that the class
was going no place. Others carried
on his fight. Friedlander sat on
the edge of the stage concerned,
yet amazed. And the fight went
on.
"Are you morally responsible
for what you teach?"
"I think I'm becoming a
convenient target for whatever is
bugging you," he replied. More
and more voices joined in both
attacking and defending the class
and the teacher.
"I paid my money to hear a
lecture," demanded a sophomore
girl, "and I want to hear it." She
was met with yells of "Three
cheers for the one-dimentional
mind," and "Right On, Wonder
Woman."
The fight dragged on. Annoyed
students became angry students.
The class was out of control—the
students were ruling the professor.
The feeling was more strange and
uncomfortable than exciting. A
girl on the side was near tears. "I
know Larry Friedlander, and
you're not giving him a chance,"
she cried.
Other remarks were inter
rupted, rousing Friedlander's ire.

"Don't be so self-righteous," he
implored. "Listen to the opinions
of everybody—we're all learning
from this."
A quiet class member got up,
walked to the front, took his class
card, and walked out saying
nothing. A girl ran after him and
brought him back. Suddenly a
student ran to the front of the
stage, knocking into Friedlander.
"You're all sitting here de
stroying my art," he screamed.
"You just don't care."
He seized the class cards and
threw them across the auditorium.
As the cards fluttered among the
seats there was an immediate
silence. A football player-type
sprang up tackling his opponent
on center stage. And suddenly as
it had all begun, the classroom
fight switched from verbal to
physical.
The class sat in disbelief as the
two wrestled in front of
Friedlander.
A low-pitched whistle froze the
action.
"Actors come forward," said
the professor. Fifteen "students"
arrived on stage from all corners
of the room—the original trouble
maker, the crying girl, the vicious
interupters, and, of course, the
two wrestlers.
The living theatre had proven
itself to be quite an experience.
The goal of making the audience
live and suffer with the actors had
been achieved. Nearly everyone
clapped, smiled, and stood in
amazement. A few attempted to
convince others that they knew all
along. One girl was terribly upset.
"I've been manipulated," she said.
"I feel put upon."
Friedlander told her he didn't
know if this dramatic form was
morally sound, and he was sorry if
people were upset. But it is
doubtful if anyone will be at a
loss to describe the living theatre
if it appears on a final.
