# Rough Draft
## Grad Deferments 
### Alan Strain 
Yesterday's front page story on
President Nixon's "executive
order" postponing the induction
of graduate students has caused
considerable confusion. The chief
problem seems to be that many
graduate students took literally
the headline: Graduate Students
Deferred.
Graduate students will nol be
deferred under I h is directive.
Actually, the new policy merely
extends rather than changes
existing practice.
With few exceptions, if you are
a graduate student you can expect
to be classified I-A, given a
pre-induction physical, and if
found acceptable ordered for
induction as soon as the order of
call brings your name up in your
local board. Only then, when you
have received an induction order,
will the President's directive
apply. The new policy simply
requires that the date of induction
be postponed until the end of the
academic year (as opposed to last
year's policy of postponing
induction until the end of a
school term.)
As a result of the President's
announcement and the lack of
clarity in the wire stories
reporting it, some students are
apparently considering cancelling
personal appearances or appeals
which they had requested after
being reclassified. This is
apparently being done on the
assumption that they will have
recourse to these procedures at
the end of the year. This is a
serious misunderstanding which
may result in the permanent loss
of these procedural rights. If your
classification is unacceptable to
you, you must exercise your right
to request a personal appearance
or appeal within thirty days of the
date of that classification.
Once under an induction order,
even though the order may be
postponed, you have no right to
appear before your local board or
to appeal your classification. And

unless there is some clear change
in your status, such as serious
illness or acceptance into a reserve
or ROTC program, there are no
grounds for further postponement
or cancellation of your induction.
Several students who were
already under postponed induc
tion orders at the time they reg
istered for fall quarter have asked
how the new policy will affect
them>
Some local boards will
probably exercise their discretion
in individual cases and continue
the postponement of induction
through the current school year.
But it seems clear that both
existing practice and the new
policy is intended to apply only
to those students who received an
induction order after beginning
the current academic year.
Students who begin fall quarter
under an induction order can
expect to be told by their boards
that since they knew they were
under an order to report for
induction, they should not have
enrolled, and any disruption to
their plans is their own
responsibility. There may,
however, be extenuating
circumstances which will be
acceptable to the board if they are
clearly explained.
President Nixon's
announcement, while permitting
graduate students who receive
induction orders before the end of
the 1969-70 year to complete a
full year's work, does not
represent a basic change in
Selective Service practice. Basic
changes must await action by
Congress or further presidential
orders.
Congressional action will be
required to establish a lottery but
the President may alter the order
of call or establish a prime age
group by executive order. Future
columns will discuss proposed
changes in the draft law or the
order in which it is possible to call
men under the existing law.
