# Real World?
## Tales of the Times 
### Marshall Kilduff 
There's a whole world around
us full of frug-crazed hippies,
speed freaks, and red-eyed
radicals. If you don't believe me,
read the Palo Alto Times, the
largest off-campus ivory tower in
the area.
Try just the last ten or twelve
days on only the front page. The
big banner headlines announced
"Teen Pot Bust" and "SDS
Terrorism." The stories were
naturally ridiculous.
After claiming that 18 kids had
been arrested on grass charges at a
Plaza dance, the facts began to
float to the surface. Some were
arrested on liquor violations as
well, the arrests were made over a
large downtown area during a
three hour period, and the dance
had actually been "fairly
orderly." Hey stupid, you just
spent your dime on the oldest
news shuck in the business.
The SDS story was equally
incredible. The story headline
proclaimed, "Radicals run riot at
schools." As it turned out there
had been several sit-ins of sorts at
different colleges, and at only one
was there any kind of violences
bruised hip, cut ear, and a few
punches thrown. The fighting was
a drag, but worth the headline?
If you're looking for real
terrorism, vibrant with details of
burning buildings, dead bodies,
and casualty lists, then you'd
better find the news from Saigon
instead.
But these articles are only
misleading if you hold them to
their headlines. A quick glance at
the story shows how untrue they
are. In fact if you think about the
whole thing, it becomes a little
more understandable: a dull day
for news, the boss wants a spiffy
headline, and, oh well, these
students certainly are an issue
these days.
If you're willing to go along
with that argument (you're doing

better than I already), please
explain the coverage of Stanford.
Here the brilliant coverage is on a
par with the headlines.
The Wednesday edition
covered the SDS meeting as
though it were a training camp.
The audience apparently was
ready to charge up Coyote Hill in
order to save it. In the article
everything said at the meeting had
the air of delusion and madness,
complete with boos and hisses.
What was actually a dull,
organizational gathering was made
to sound like plans for a back
alley streetfight.
A lot of people are incredibly
hung up on issues like student
politics and dope, and this type of
reaction is understandable on
those terms. What most people
object to is the complete lack of
honesty and fairness in the Times
coverage.
If the paper is going to pose as
an objective, impartial reporter of
the facts, then it has to make an
attempt. The Times fails
miserably to do just that. Its news
coverage of student movements
here always manage to include
opinion as well. In many cases
these articles go unsigned, a subtle
way of implying lack of
controversy or the obvious nature
of the reporting.
I'd be the last person in the
world to swear the Daily's
reliability and objectivity, but
nearly everyone knows and
accepts the fact that the Daily
isn't as objective as it would like.
This paper is well aware of its
reputation and accepts it as well.
It's journalism like the Times
that creates a need for the
Observer and Chaparral, etc. Many
know that their point of view will
never receive fair treatment in the
straight newspapers.
So the only way to fight this
suppression is to create media of
your own. It's a sad and bitter

realization to come to. No one
wants to waste his time running
around town chasing ads, haggling
with printers over censorship, and
placating editorial egos.
"The Palo Alio Times has
done more to radicalize kids
around here than anything else,"
says Tim Coburn, who works for
the Free U. "Those people really
just don't understand. Some
people just aren't going to fit into
narrow roles."
Look at its coverage of the
Free U. since its start. The whole
slant is from a weirdo-drugs-sex
angle. There are no attempts at
taking the whole project seriously,
and hell, even the Chronicle tried
that last year. Of late the only
time the Free U. makes it in the
paper is when one of the staffers
is arrested.
Robert Cullenbine, one of the
organizers, claims the Times
"consistently misleads, lies, and
distorts." He credits the Times
with arousing the right-wing
crazies that bombed their offices
last year. As for Times editor
Alexander Bodi: "He attacks
anything that's a threat to his
interests."
If you want to get an idea of
who the enemy is, read Bodi's
column on the editorial page. His
latest warning concerned the
danger of being duped into
conservation groups by those wily
old SDSers out there in the trees
(they no longer hide under beds).
To begin with he doubts
motives —"I have a feeling that
they are less interested in
protecting our heritage than in
using the cause for their political
purposes." He also manages to
come down on 'street people' who
pull up flowers in parks—the roar
of motorcycles and sports cars
and rock music." Mr. Bodi has no
kids, by the way.
His column can be ignored, but
he also happens to be the Times
editor. His influence in the
Peninsula area is enormous. By
mounting this anti-youth
campaign, chances for any kind of
open discussion or dialogue about
problems are becoming
impossible. Since there is no
youth center in Palo Alto, Plaza
dances are about the only outlet
many kids can dig. Is it too much
to ask?
If the August be-in at El
Camino doesn't meet with the
paper's approval, then at the least
they should offer some
alternatives. The aftermath, which
included three "rapes," was
treated in characteristic Times
style of screaming headlines, and
inaccuracy would have been easily
avoided if the Times would step
back and look at what's going on
in the real world.
After all, Mr. Bodi, these are
your readers' kids you're coming
down on.
