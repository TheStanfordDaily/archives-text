# Dear Mom
## Maim For Peace 
### Cissie Bonini 
(Mom is back with The Daily
again this year, this time as a
graduate student in history. For
the uninitiated. Mom and Cissie
Bonini are the same person. A
mother she is, with seven children
and even a husband, Business
School Prof. Charles Bonini. As
ever, Mom appreciates letters,
comments, questions, and young
people. In that order.)
Honeybunch Dornhoffer—
beautiful tan freshman woman
from Burbank—approached the
registration Pavilion with
trepidation. Card tables stacked
with colorful literature lined the
walk and bearded upperclassmen
salivated as she approached.
One banner: MAIM FOR
PEACE caught her eye.
"MAIM represents our slogan,
'Maul, Assault, Insult, and
Mutilate for Peace," explained the
table's occupant, arranging his
carefully disheveled hair.
"You must be like the 1.R.A.,"
said Honeybunch.
"Certainly not," replied the
MAIM member indignantly. "The
Irish are involved in a reactionary
religious dispute. Anyone can hate
for religious reasons. We're
intellectuals. We're against the
university, the government, the
older generation, the military, the
industrial, our parents, the
faculty, cigarettes, and
post-marital sex."
"Are you lor anything?"
queried Honeybunch.
"We're for love and peace."
"But how does mutilating and
assault fit into a pacifist plan?"
"That's easy," replied the Rad.
"We detest lovingly. For example,
when stomping a faculty member,
we always refer to him as
"Professor" or "Sir."
"Faculty members don't really
care what you do to them —just
how you address them. Also, we
have a new "soft" policy toward
the administration. We only throw
soft things at them, you know,
tomatoes, plums, eggs ..."
Convinced, Honeybunch was
about to sign a MAIM
membership list when three
identically dressed clean-shaven
youths in vests ran up and
pinioned her arms behind her.
"Don't!" said the first.
"Stop!" said the second.
"Desist!" said the third.
''We're the Y.A.C.
group—Young Americans for
Conformity. This is the best of all
possible universities in the best of
all possible administrations. And
the nifty war is helping the
economy and making a better life
for all mankind through
Westinghouse. Three cheers for
Dick Nixon! Love and tolerance
for everyone, and let's hang
anyone who disagrees!"
"I feel overwhelmed," said
Honeybunch.
"You feel overwhelmed
because of the population
explosion," said a voice from the
Zero Population Growth table
also known as the Black Widow
Society. "Come and back our
group We don't want the birth
rate to exceed the death rate, so
you kill your husband as soon as
you discover you're pregnant."

"What if you have twins?"
asked Honeybunch.
"If you have twins, you have
ten days in which to do away with
yourself."
"I'm not planning to start my
family until my sophomore year,"
said Honeybunch, "and I can't
join the 'Unfair to Women' group
because I think the ratio is marvy.
I guess I'll just join the Axe
Committee." She then receded
into the Pavilion.
MORAL: HE WHO AXES
SHALL RECEDE.

trepidation. Card tables stacked
with colorful literature lined the
walk and bearded upperclassmen
salivated as she approached.
One banner: MAIM FOR
PEACE caught her eye.
"MAIM represents our slogan,
'Maul, Assault, Insult, and
Mutilate for Peace," explained the
table's occupant, arranging his
carefully disheveled hair.
"You must be like the 1.R.A.,"
said Honeybunch.
"Certainly not," replied the
MAIM member indignantly. "The
Irish are involved in a reactionary
religious dispute. Anyone can hate
for religious reasons. We're
intellectuals. We're against the
university, the government, the
older generation, the military, the
industrial, our parents, the
faculty, cigarettes, and
post-marital sex."
"Are you lor anything?"
queried Honeybunch.
"We're for love and peace."
"But how does mutilating and
assault fit into a pacifist plan?"
"That's easy," replied the Rad.
"We detest lovingly. For example,
when stomping a faculty member,
we always refer to him as
"Professor" or "Sir."
"Faculty members don't really
care what you do to them —just
how you address them. Also, we
have a new "soft" policy toward
the administration. We only throw
soft things at them, you know,
tomatoes, plums, eggs ..."
Convinced, Honeybunch was
about to sign a MAIM
membership list when three
identically dressed clean-shaven
youths in vests ran up and
pinioned her arms behind her.
"Don't!" said the first.
"Stop!" said the second.
"Desist!" said the third.
''We're the Y.A.C.
group—Young Americans for
Conformity. This is the best of all
possible universities in the best of
all possible administrations. And
the nifty war is helping the
economy and making a better life
for all mankind through
Westinghouse. Three cheers for
Dick Nixon! Love and tolerance
for everyone, and let's hang
anyone who disagrees!"
"I feel overwhelmed," said
Honeybunch.
"You feel overwhelmed
because of the population
explosion," said a voice from the
Zero Population Growth table
also known as the Black Widow
Society. "Come and back our
group We don't want the birth
rate to exceed the death rate, so
you kill your husband as soon as
you discover you're pregnant."

"What if you have twins?"
asked Honeybunch.
"If you have twins, you have
ten days in which to do away with
yourself."
"I'm not planning to start my
family until my sophomore year,"
said Honeybunch, "and I can't
join the 'Unfair to Women' group
because I think the ratio is marvy.
I guess I'll just join the Axe
Committee." She then receded
into the Pavilion.
MORAL: HE WHO AXES
SHALL RECEDE.
