# Public Outcry
## CBW Hypocrisy 
### Andy Smith 
The past year has seen a
rapidly growing concern over the
potentialities of chemical and
biological warfare.
This concern has been
displayed not only by students,
but also by many political figures,
as manifested by spirited debates
within Congress and the
Administration, on a national
level, and by world conferences,
on the international plane. Yet if
one can derive any guidance from
past history, public outcries alone
do not herald any changes in
national or international CBW
nolicy.
Seventy years ago an
international conference in Hague
resulted in agreement by
participating nations to ban the
use of rocket-disseminated
noxious gases. Yet gas warfare was
used by both sides during World
War I. While comparatively mild
irritants, such as tear gas, were
used in the initial stages of the
war, by the later years deadly
chemicals such as mustard and
phosgene were being employed.
By the end of the war, over one
million casualties directly
attributable to gas had
accumulated, of which nearly
100,000 were fatal.
These figures cannot include,
of course, the unknown numbers
of soldiers killed or wounded by
conventional weapons, after gas
had forced them into the open. It
is interesting to note that at least
one Hague participant defended
its use of gas in the war, on the
grounds that dispersal was
achieved by means other than
missiles.
The post-war years saw the
staging of a number of
conferences, participants of which
denounced various aspects of
CBW, either formally or
informally. The mor,< important
of these was the oft-cited Geneva
Gas Protocol (1925), which
prohibited the use of
"asphyxiating" and "poisonous"
gases, as well as bacteriological
warfare. Less than a decade later,
however, Italy, which had signed
and ratified the Geneva treaty,
was using mustard gas against

Ethiopia. Even before that, Japan
became the first nation to begin a
large-scale research and
development program in
biological warfare. Other
countries soon followed suit.
World War II saw surprisingly
little use of CBW, or even
accusations of such use. It was in
the middle of this conflict that
President Roosevelt issued his
famous statement declaring that
the U.S. would never resort to
CBW except in response to the
first use by another country.
Throughout thr war, it was
iloosovalt more than any other
man who prevented American use
of biological warfare agents.
Yet in 1956, "The Law of
Land Warfare," an army manual,
denied that any treaty restricted
American use of CBW (the U.S.
had signed, but not ratified, the
Geneva Gas Protocol). When a
resolution essentially re-stating
the Roosevelt position was
introduced into the House of
Representatives in 1959, it was
shelved by State and Defense
Department pressure.
This verbal two-sidedness of
the American government toward
the use of CBW is matched by a
double standard with regard to
action. As is now well known, the
U.S. has been using several
chemical warfare agents in
Vietnam for the past few years.
Yet when in 1967 it condemned
the use of poisonous gases by the
United Arab Republic, the State
Department declared that the U.S.
would support international
action aimed at halting such
tactics. And less than a year
earlier, America supported a U.N.
resolution calling for adherence to
the Geneva Protocol.
The lesson of the past fifty
years seems to be that
proclamations, resolutions, and
treaties have little or no influence
in checking the development of
CBW agents. In this light, the
present anti-CBW wave of public
opinion and official doctrine may
be very misleading. In a world
where murder and its threat are a
daily task, man will cling
tenaciously to his most
sophisticated tools.
