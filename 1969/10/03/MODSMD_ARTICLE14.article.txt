# SCORE Funds Questioned
## 
### 
More than music will be
produced this Sunday afternoon
when the Stanford Committee On
a Radical Education (SCORE)
presents its benefit concert at
Frost Amphitheater.
SCORE is the on-campus
representative organization for
student members of the
Midpeninsula Free University,
whose use of funds from an earlier
concert is being challenged by the
Stanford administration.
Stanford recently rejected a
$3,100 request by SCORE to use
money raised at an August 17
concert for a new printing press.
According to J. Thomas
Bacchetti, Director of Public
Events, his sub-committee decided
against the appropriation because
the printing press would be
located off-campus, and therefore
not used for university functions.
The summer concert with
seven bands, including Sons A*

Uliamplin and Lamb, earned over
$3,000 for SCORE. About 4,000
people attended the concert.
"We're going to use the money
as specified in the University
regulations for furthering
SCORE's radical education on
campus," said Tim Coburn, who
organized the concert,
"Present University policy on
public events," said Bacchetti,
"allows funds from benefit
concerts on campus to be used
only to benefit Stanford
organizations or charities."
According to Bacchetti, even
the Children's Health Council
benefit and the East-West Shrine
game scheduled over New Year's
are against the existing policy,
because the funds go to outside,
although worthwhile, charities.
As SCORE sees it, the Public
Events Office must choose either
a single standard, though it may
mean excluding some worthwhile

groups, or multiple standards
which would require investigating
each request for a benefit.
In addition to questioning the
use of funds for a printing press,
allegations have been made that
SCORE would use funds for legal
aid to the students facing trial for
SRI demonstration. Many of the
103 students arrested in the
demonstration last May belong to
SCORE.
Tim Coburn says that
"students do have a different
point of view from the Free U. in
the community. To say that
SCORE is a front for the Free U.
is to say that Stanford University
is a front for the U.S.
government."
A concert agreement signed by
five SCORE representatives states
that "all receipts from the event
shall be promptly deposited in the
Student Organization Fund to the
credit of the agency account of

SCOKE . . .and disbursement .. .
shall be in accordance with the
rules of the Stanford Organization
Fund. It is the understanding of
the Office of Public Events that
all receipts shall be used
exclusively for the activities of
SCORE and not for any other
purposes or organizations."
Checks normally go through
only the ASSU Financial Office
for approval. Recently, SCORE
has been the only organization
whose requests for money have
been referred to the Office of
Public Events.

concert is being challenged by the
Stanford administration.
Stanford recently rejected a
$3,100 request by SCORE to use
money raised at an August 17
concert for a new printing press.
According to J. Thomas
Bacchetti, Director of Public
Events, his sub-committee decided
against the appropriation because
the printing press would be
located off-campus, and therefore
not used for university functions.
The summer concert with
seven bands, including Sons A*

Uliamplin and Lamb, earned over
$3,000 for SCORE. About 4,000
people attended the concert.
"We're going to use the money
as specified in the University
regulations for furthering
SCORE's radical education on
campus," said Tim Coburn, who
organized the concert,
"Present University policy on
public events," said Bacchetti,
"allows funds from benefit
concerts on campus to be used
only to benefit Stanford
organizations or charities."
According to Bacchetti, even
the Children's Health Council
benefit and the East-West Shrine
game scheduled over New Year's
are against the existing policy,
because the funds go to outside,
although worthwhile, charities.
As SCORE sees it, the Public
Events Office must choose either
a single standard, though it may
mean excluding some worthwhile

groups, or multiple standards
which would require investigating
each request for a benefit.
In addition to questioning the
use of funds for a printing press,
allegations have been made that
SCORE would use funds for legal
aid to the students facing trial for
SRI demonstration. Many of the
103 students arrested in the
demonstration last May belong to
SCORE.
Tim Coburn says that
"students do have a different
point of view from the Free U. in
the community. To say that
SCORE is a front for the Free U.
is to say that Stanford University
is a front for the U.S.
government."
A concert agreement signed by
five SCORE representatives states
that "all receipts from the event
shall be promptly deposited in the
Student Organization Fund to the
credit of the agency account of

SCOKE . . .and disbursement .. .
shall be in accordance with the
rules of the Stanford Organization
Fund. It is the understanding of
the Office of Public Events that
all receipts shall be used
exclusively for the activities of
SCORE and not for any other
purposes or organizations."
Checks normally go through
only the ASSU Financial Office
for approval. Recently, SCORE
has been the only organization
whose requests for money have
been referred to the Office of
Public Events.
More than music will be
produced this Sunday afternoon
when the Stanford Committee On
a Radical Education (SCORE)
presents its benefit concert at
Frost Amphitheater.

representative organization for
student members of the
Midpeninsula Free University,
whose use of funds from an earlier
