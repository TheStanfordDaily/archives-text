colleges' Chancellor Glenn S.
Dumke ordered Thursday that all
classes in the 19-campus system
be held as scheduled during a
nation-wide anti-Vietnam War
observance announced for Octo
ber 15.
"I feel a student has a right to
go to class . . .and has a perfect
right not to be dragged out of the
class to listen to a political
harangue," Dumke said in an
interview.
The chancellor commented on
a news statement released from
his Los Angeles office Thursday.
The statement said Dumke was
"reaffirming a policy that dis
missal of classes in support of
social or political causes is a
violation of professional ethics."
The statement did not say
peaceful demonstrations were
prohibited. But it said classes
must be met by their instructors.
