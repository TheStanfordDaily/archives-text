# Mock Vote Taken
## Unruh Beats Alioto 
### 
Jesse Unruh defeated Joe
Alioto for the Democratic
nomination for governor of
California and George Brown wen
the race for U.S. Senate candidate
in a mock Democratic primary
conducted during registration by
the Stanford Democratic Club.
Stanford's 11,000 students
received "Dump Reagan" ballots
in their packets of leaflets from
several voluntary campus
organizations. A total of 451
ballots were deposited in the
Democratic Club's ballot box, but
only those bearing the names,

campus addresses, and phone
numbers of the student voters
were counted.
The results of the primary for
governor were: Jesse Unruh, 168;
and Joe Alioto, 110. In the
contest for U.S. Senator the
results were: George Brown, 98;
John Tunney, 65; and Stanley
Mosk, 23.
Stanford Democratic Club
president Roger Wilner made no
claim that the poll was accurate.
"This mock primary wasn't
representative of the Stanford
student body, but it did measure

sentiment among those students
willing to commit themselves to
working to defeat Reagan and
Murphy in lS7o,"said Wilner.
Wilner, a senior in political
science, was field representative
for the Alan Cranston campaign in
Los Angeles county.
The Stanford Democratic Club
was formed last spring to bring
the Democrats on campus
together and to teach members of
the Stanford community about
practical politics and to enlist
their aid in specific campaigns. At
present, there are 62 members.
