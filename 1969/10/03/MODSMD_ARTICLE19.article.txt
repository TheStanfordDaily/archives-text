Two United States Senators
will be speaking on the Stanford
campus this weekend.
Democratic Senator George S.
McGovern of South Dakota will
appear on Sunday at 11 as
keynote speaker in Memorial
Church services.
Senator Peter Dominick,
Republican from Colorado, will
speak on the accomplishments
and frustrations of the Nixon
administration this Saturday
afternoon at 3:30 in the Tresidder
large lounge.
McGovern's speech will be the
first in a series of contemporary

laymen under the sponsorship ol
the Stanford United Ministry.
Introducing McGovern will be
Reverend B. Davie Napier, dean of
the chapel.
The Senator was elected to
Congress in 1963, but lie has more
recently received public interest
for his 1968 presidential
candidacy and his outspoken
opposition to the Vietnamese war.
In his latest speech in Hartford,
Connecticut, he advocated
offering asylum to South
Vietnamese who would fear
consequences of a U.S. troop
withdrawal.
Prior to his present second
term in the Senate, McGovern was
a member of the 85th and 86
Congresses of the House of
Representatives. In 1961 he was
appointed Food for Peace
Director and Special Assistant to
President Kennedy.
The Senator, who holds a
master's and doctoral degree in
history and political science, was a
professor at Dakota Wesleyan
from 1949 to 1953, as well as an
author of three books.
Presently McGovern holds the
chairmanships of the Senate
Select Committee on Nutrition
and Human Needs, and the Senate
Sub-committee on Indian Affairs.
Dominick, the fourth ranking
Republican on the Senate Armed
Services Committee, is expected
to discuss the recently proposed
30-day moratorium on criticism
of President Nixon's handling of
the Vietnam war.
As a member of the Labor and

Public Welfare committee, he is
qualified to touch on a wide range
of topics.
The Senator also serves as
chairman of the Western States
GOP Senatorial Campaign
Committee. He intends to explain
Republican plans for the
all-important '70 election.
First elected to the Senate in
1962, he won re-election in 1968
by a 60 per cent margin.
The speech will be followed by
a reception in the small lounge for
those who want to meet with
Dominick.
The program, sponsored by the
Young Republicans, is part of a
two-day visit to the Bay Area
under the auspices of the
Republican Alliance.
