# Groups, Festivals
## Summer Supergroove 
### COREY GOODMAN CRAIG OKINO 
For what it's worth, there's
been a lot of music in this summer
of the supergroups and super
festivals. I watched as groups of
established rock musicians from
broken bands jammed together
and as hundreds of thousands of
pilgrims, myself included, jammed
into an alfalfa field in the
Catskills.
One supergroup, Blind Faith,
was a disappointment. Selling
albums and concert tickets on
their big names, the group of
Clapton, Winwood, Baker, and
Grech rushed their LP and concert
appearance. With more time, they
can perhaps reach the same level
as the supergroup of Crosby,
Stills, Nash, and Young. They
made their acoustic and electric
setted debut in Chicago, appearing
more together and worked out
than Blind Faith's nearly
disasterous appearance in the
same town.
Last summer also saw the
Stones give their first concert in
14 months, with Mick Jagger
giving a farewell to Brian Jones
and welcoming Mick Taylor, the
lead guitarist coming from
England's blues training ground,
John Mayall. There was the poet's
return, as Bob Dylan sang on the
Isle of Wight, and there was the
disaster at Newport.
And that same part of the
country that housed Big Pink,
Dylan, and countless other
musicians also produced An
Aquarian Exposition: Woodstock.
Countless articles have been
written about Woodstock as a
happening, of Woodstock and
drugs, but few have talked about
what it was that attracted all of us
there and kept us waiting through
the mud and rainâ€”the music.
Everyone Showed
Nearly everyone promised
showed up, and those that did put
on the best performances I've seen
from them. Though it started on
Friday afternoon, the festival was
really first recognized by Arlo
Guthrie that night, who looked
out at the community and talked

about what was happening. And
after him, everyone performed as
if they were part of Woodstock, as
if the audience and performers
were the same.
On Saturday, I took part in
Woodstock from close to the
stage, in the middle of 300,000
hot and thirsty people. Starting at
two o'clock in the afternoon, he
music only stopped when the
Airplace finished the last note of
"White Rabbit" and 8:30 the next
morning. By that time it was
already light, and mud stained
Grace Slick sang one of her best
performances with the sun just
rising above her head (and Nicky-
Hopkins jamming with the group
on piano).
Syinbolic Performance
Sometime that night, Canned
Heat came on stage. Their
performance was symbolic of the
whole festival. The Bear came out
first and announced that one
week earlier, with the loss of lead
guitarist Henry Vestine, Canned
Heat was thinking of breaking up.
But they had found Harvey
Mandel, the famous blues and jazz
instrumentalist, and with only
two practices, were going to
perform. And by the end of set,
the Bear smiled and said that the
response from the audience had
convinced him that Canned Heat
was going to stay together.
Mandel didn't fit in completely;
there were tensions between his
loose solos and the groups normal
tight jamming. But just as the
Bear motioned acceptance of
Mandel's lead solo, so did the
audience see that with more
practice, Channed Heat was on
the road again.
Thunder Grooves
When Sunday's concert started
at two in the afternoon, it was
more of the same, and except for
the interruption of a three hour
thunderstorm (the sky's chance to
perform thunderous music), the
music lasted until Hendrix
finished at 10:15 Monday
morning. After the rain, Country
Joe and the Fish, together again
after breaking up, played to the
world's wettest and muddiest

crowd. And in the spirit of a rain
dance, they finished their set with
hundreds of thousands of voices
screaming out the "Fish Cheer."
Jimi Hendrix performed last
with his new gypsy band. Sun and
Rainbows. He was smiling and
friendly, and for over two hours
played and rapped with us as a
peaceful and loving new Hendrix
rather than the violent old
Hendrix. He had just come over
from his farm house located close
by in the town of Woodstock, and
he too got excited as the sun rose
before he came out.
It was symbolic, he said, and
that's what his new group and
music was all about. The group
had only practiced once together
two days earlier, and in their first
appearance at Woodstock they
played all of the songs they knew
plus more.
At the end of "Hey Joe,"
Hendrix said, for lack of songs, he
would just keep playing his guitar
till he got tired. He thanked us for
coming, and I hiked back to my
car and drove off, tired, dirty, and
glad that I had experienced
Woodstock.
