# Transcendentalist Where Were You?
## 
### 
Will the person who was supposed to give a lecture on
transcendental meditation last Wednesday night at 8:00 in Cubberley
please come forward?
It was announced in Monday's Daily in OATQ that there would be
such an event. But we can't remember who put the announcement in.
At any rate, the lecturer never materialized, to the disappointment
of almost four of us. (One boy waiting for the lecture decided instead
to see the student flicks that were also scheduled for 8:00, Wednesday
night, in Cubberley.)
Yet the three of us remaining did not entirely waste our time
waiting. One guy gave us quite an informative discussion on the
economic advantages of rolling cigarettes, and he ably demonstrated
his talents.
GPA Up-Oh Wow
He also informed us that a former girlfriend had improved her GPA
from a 2.8 to a 3.8 and now feels refreshed on only four hours of
sleep a nightâ€”all because of transcendental meditation.
Then we talked about hypnosis and had a little dispute on whether
a person can be convinced into anything (like making love with the
hypnotist) while helplessly in a trance.
One guy thought you could. "I was once given a post hypnotic
suggestion at a party," he explained, "and every time I heard someone
cough, I picked my nose."
Guru In Charge
It was 8:15 and still no lecture. Some guy with a heavy beard
walked by. We thought maybe he was the guru in charge.
He wasn't.
In the meantime, Cubberly auditorium was rapidly filling with
spectators for the student films.
"Hey, let's go in and watch the stoney flicks," someone cried as he
walked through the outside door. "I could really groove to them."
We finally figured the guru-lecturer was probably grooving to them,
too.
