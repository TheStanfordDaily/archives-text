## San Francisco '69 Season Preview 
### GARY SCHMIDGALL 
When Opera is good, it is an
entertainment paradise. But, to
turn Mae West's two-liner, when
opera is bad, it can be naively bad,
seat-squirmingly bad,
spectacularly bad, or even
pleasantly bad.
This is, of course, the burden
of every opera company:
perfection is singular—hard to
attain and even harder to
maintain, while failure can occur
in many ways and degrees. This is,
simply, because the opera is one
of the most complex and most
demanding of all art-forms.
The San Francisco Opera has
explored both ends of the
spectrum. Its stunning successes
(its liarber of Seville, Orff's
Carmina Hurana, and Salome) are
unforgettable; its crashing
mistakes like last year's triple-bill
one longs desperately to forget.
Yet when all is said, the
possibility of seeing successful
collaboration between composer,
designer, director, musician,
singer, dancer, conductor,
librettist, and artist provides an
attraction impossible to deny.
And this season's repertory and
roster of singers makes the odds
on such a success very good
indeed. If what is on paper
materializes at the Opera House
this fall, we may well be in for
quite a treat this season.
Squinly Scrupulosity
Kurt Adler, intendant of the
SFO must fill the slots in his
yearly season with as much
squinty-eyed scrupulosity as, say,
Vince Lombardi did with his
Green Bay Packers. This year is no
exception: there are the
powerhouses who never fail to
make box-office yardage (Aida,
La Boheme, La Traviata), the
rock-ribbed linemen

(Gotterdammerung, Fidelio), and
the specialists (Ariadne and
Pelleas et Melisande). And then
the comic half-time
entertainment, Rossini's version
of Cinderella and Donizetti's
L'Llisir d'A more.
The 1969 season is another
paradigm of balance: old and new;
German-F re nch-Italian-English;
high art and low kitch; comedy,
fantasy, farce and tragedy. The
season will please no one all the
time; but then, no one should be
left entirely in the cold, either.
Gentlemen Dominate
This season might well be
dominated by the gentlemen,
especially the tenors. Thomas,
King, Pavarotti, Chauvet,
Bergonzi, Spiess, Vickers and
Bottazzo are all splendid singers;
but this extravagance must not
adversely affect the other voice
categories.
Another source of interest is
the adventuresome conducting
assignments made by the San
Francisco Opera (SFO); Six ten
Ehrling from the Detroit Sym
phony for Fidelio, Charles
Mackerras for The Magic Flute,
composer Gunther Schuller for
Ariadne, and new faces for an
important Cotlerdammerung and
a premiere of Jenul'a by Leos
Janacek. Less auspiciously,
Frenchman Jean Perisson breaks
out of his native repertory to do
I.a IJolieme and Airia.
Fidelio—Beethoven:
Beethoven's lone operatic
creation, as one might suspect, is a
strange, problematical affair. It's
success is finally more
Beethovenian than operatic and
perhaps this is why SFO has
engaged a prominent orchestral
conductor—Sixten Ehrling from
Detroit—to lead this year's
Fidelio. The lovers (husband and

wife, no less) will be sung by
Gwyneth Jones and James King.
Their portrayal of the roles of
Leonora and Florestan should be
exemplary, as they have just
recorded them for release next
year. Übiquitous (and rather
erratic) Paui Hager will be the
director.
Gotterdammerung—Wagner:
San Francisco reaches the
three-quarter mark in its new Ring
Cycle with Cotterdaemmerung.
This culminating Wagnerian opera
may be the highlight of the season
if the principals—Amy Shuard and
Jess Thomas—produce the
intellectual dimension demanded
by the roles. The Ring seems to
be San Francisco's gift lo Jess
Thomas (He is liie Heldentenor
for the cycle); he should piove
equal to the task.
As with any Wagnerian opera,
the burden of proof lies with the

conductor; and wisely or not San
Francisco is changing conductors
in mid-cycle: Otniar Suitner
makes his debut.
La Boheme—Puccini:
Puccini's lyrical-sentimental
bohemianism has proven
consistently popular to San
Franciscans, and it is here again
from that exemplary season,
1967.
Somehow the phrase "grand
old lady" does not wear
comfortably with Dorothy
Kirsten, whose voice and charm, if
not her figure, belie a younger
singer. Yet, she has been around a
long time. She is a Puccini
specialist (her Madama Butterfly
is incomparable) and will be quite
at home in this opera. Luciano
Pavarotti will surely supply the
vocal thrust for this Boheme. His
portrayal of Rodolfo of two years
ago is still vivid. He has more than

ample resources and good taste —a
merciful combination.
The Magic Flute—Mozart:
Unlike Mozart's more famous
operas, The Magic Klule was
written in German. San Francisco
will stage this production in
English.
The Queen of the Night and
Pamina will be new to S.F., but
the Tamino (Stuart Burrows) and
Pnpageno (Geraint Evans) are
returning from this same
production of 1967. Evans is a
bird catcher in the opera but is
himself a rara a\i> of the operatic
world -a consummate singing
actor.
A British newcomer
experienced in the iighter-than-air
repertory (especially Gilbert and
Sullivan)— Charles Mackerras
promises a new look at Mozart's
bemusing, funtastical score.
