# Sympathetic Vibrations
## Where To Buy Sound 
### Terry Rustin 
Rising costs and lowering
quality have blighted nearly all
consumer products, with on
noticeable exception. The high
fidelity sound reproduction
equipment available today is of
better quality and less expensive
than ever before.
A set now costing $150 could
not have been purchased ten years
ago for twice that, nd a system
now available for $400 could not
have been had for any price. This
happy situation is a result, quite
frankly, of good old Americah
know-how and the glorious
free-enterprise system. And about
three hundred years of
investigation into electricity and
magnetism throughout the world.
Thanks, Transistor
Be that as it may, th£
development of the transistor by
our good friend Mr. Shockley is
responsible for the fast, accurate,
small and power-stingy
components now available.
Research by the Acoustical
Research people a few years back
developed small, clean and full
speakers, and recent work by a
number of companies has yielded
superior cartridges.
This is not an ad for the stereo
companies; it is merely a reminder
that we need not be without
music, for it can be had quite
reasonably. If you are in the
market for a stereo system, or you
are thinking of updating your
current set-up, I suggest you do a
bit of research before laying out
any bread.
Impartial Journal
Consumer K«>ports is an
impartial, fair, and to my mind,
accurate journal published
monthly by the Consumer Union,
which is an impartial, non-profit
institution. They go into the
stores and buy the same
merchandise you might buy, test
it thoroughly, and then unload it.
The opinions of their experts
are presented in the magazine,
which accepts no advertising, and
relies solely on subscription sales.
Stanford's main library subscribes

to CR and to its annual resume,
the Ituying (Juide, and current
copies are at the periodical desk
on the main floor.
CR is probably your best
source of technical information
and objective comparisons of
products. But the ultimate
deciding point is what sounds best
to you. After having perused CR,
hop down to Alco Home
Electronics in Los Altos or
Lafayette Radio and Electronics
in Mountain View and listen to
what they have. Alco has a bigger
selection, but Lafayette brand
equipment is only available at
their stores.
If your budget is particularly
tight, Lafayette makes some
reasonably good equipment at
very low prices.
Try Sel at Home
If you are going to make a
large purchase, the store will
generally let you try out your
system at home. Keep in mind
that the listening room in the
store is quite a bit different from
the room you'll be placing your
system in. Sound absorbers like
rugs, upholstered chairs and
drapery affect the sound, as does
the size of the room.
You probably don't need a 150
watt amplifier unless you like to
entertain the folks on Hoo Tow.
The stereo salesman is still a
salesman, so be careful.
Discount
If you buy a complete system,
the store will give you a discount.
Also watch the newsprint
magazine section of the Sunday
Chronicle for the sales at Pacific
and McDaniel's and the other hi-fi
shops.

Still, good equipment is
expensive, and so are records and
tapes, even though they really are
good. There is another way,
however. You can buy a pair of
speakers, and a receiver (or a
tuner and an amplifier). You
avoid the expense of a turntable
and a cartridge, and all the music
you want is available, free, 24
hours a day on Bay Area radio
stations, AM and FM. Although
you cannot choose what you want
at any given moment, you can
shop around the various stations,
and you'll probably find a
favorite. FM stations generally
broadcast good sound, in stereo,
and it's free.
Next time: station suggestions.
