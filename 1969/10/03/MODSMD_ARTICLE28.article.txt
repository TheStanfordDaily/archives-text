## Tennis Team An Early Start 
### HALL DAILY 
Official tennis practice for the Indian varsity commences next
Monday when Coach Dick Gould calls his first team meeting. While a
host of returning lettermen and potent freshmen will attend to contest
for the top six varsity positions, noticeably absent will be last year's
frosh standouts Paul Gerken.who has transferred to Trinity University
in Texas, and Mac Claflin, who is at Stanford in Germany until
January.
However, hopes run very high at Stanford that this season's court
chances could be better than ever before. Once again, the Indians head
the challenge list of Pac-8 schools vying to dethrone USC and UCLA
from their perennial domination of West Coast intercollegiate tennis
fortunes.
Forming the nucleus of this year's squad will be a weighty corps of
returning veterans and a dozen competent freshmen and transfers. The
returning lettermen include Chris Chapin, John Wright, and Claflin,
who represented Stanford as freshmen at the NCAA Championships
last spring in Princeton. The trio combined with Paul Gerken to garner
eighth place in the competition.
Due to an abundance of injuries last season, Coach Gould will
concentrate this fall on snapping his players into peak condition by
Thanksgiving. Gould says, "We will participate in a much more
vigorous fall conditioning and weight program than in the past. We
will be ready for our tough and demanding dual meet and tournament
schedule beginning in mid-February."
If the coach's new fall program is successful, Stanford may be well
on its way to accomplishing its two foremost goals: first, to capture
the conference title; and second, to field a national championship
team.
