# Theta Dells Excell In IM Competition
## 
### SCOTT BURNS 
Campus demonstrations may
have been the student activities
which gained the most publicity
last year, but there was another
activity that received very little
mention, and probably had more
participants. Intramural sports can
boast having had over 6,000
different participants in 25
different sports and activities last
yearâ€”a mark that probably no
other continuous campus activity
can match.
Theta Delta Chi amassed an
amazing 253 points in the spring
sports to capture the overall title
for the year (out of 105 teams),
and will receive the IM
Championship Trophy at halftime
of the Washington State football
game.
Blackacre, a team composed of
law students, took second, Kappa
Alpha finished third, the Phuds,
an independent team, captured
fourth, and El Toro eating club
placed fifth.
Madera was the top freshman
dorm, placing seventeenth overall,
and Burbank was the highest
placing upperclass dorm, taking
20th. An amazing job was done
by Serra which placed 24th while
having the supposed handicap of
being coed (girls can't compete in
IM's).
Intramural points are given to a
team for placement in league and
tournament play. Each sport has a
different set of possible points
assigned it, and the amount of
points is based on the number of
participants in each type of
competition.

In softball last spring, the
Theta Delts captured the title for
the second year in a row by
downing the Phuds. The Phi
Kappa barely beat the DU's for
the Six Man Volleyball
championship. The tennis
tournament was captured by
Kappa Alpha who nosed out
Blackacre to win. A team formed
during spring quarter called the
Dirty Old Men handled the Kappa
Sigs to win the waterpolo
championship, but the aquatic
Kappa Sigs came back to barely
nudge the Chi Psi's out for first
place in the swim meet.
Competition in the meet was so
fierce that many of those
competing could have been stars
for other college swim teams. In
track and field, El Toro, the
annual winner, easily won over
the Theta Delts and Phuds, who
tied for second.
Fall sport sign ups continue this
week up through October 6 and
competition starts October 8.
Football schedules should be out
Monday. Intramurals provide a
great opportunity for fun and
exercise, and all who are
interested are invited to
participate this coming year.
