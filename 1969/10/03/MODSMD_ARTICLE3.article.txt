# Senate Votes More Autonomy To Foreign Study Programs
## 
### MARGIE WOLF 
Bringing prolonged study and
tedious balancing to an end, the
Faculty Senate yesterday after
noon adopted a compromise pro
posal for decentralizing control of
the overseas campus program.
A central Foreign Study Pro
grams committee, with subcom
mittees representing each overseas
campus and study program, will
replace the single Overseas
Campus Subcommittee of the
General Studies Committee. Both
the subcommittee and the central
committee will be able to initiate
policy considerations, thus pro
viding more opportunity for
campuses to develop autonomous
programs especially suited for
their situations.
The Senate also took one step
toward dealing with the relation
ship between the University and
minority groups. The Senate
Committee on Committees was
instructed to study how to best
attack the problem—whether by
forming an Academic Council
committee, a University-wide
committee, or subcommittees of
existing committees.
In a third action, Senators
approved a charge to the Com
mittee on University Press. The
group both sets general policy and
holds ultimate authority for re
viewing prospective publications
of the Stanford Press. For the first
time it will include one student
member.
The Senate met yesterday from
3:15 to 6 p.m. in the Graduate
Business School.

Under the new foreign study
organization, the programs' chief
administrative officer will no
longer serve simultaneously as
chairman of the current policy
making Overseas Campus Sub
committee. He will merely be a
non-voting, ex officio member of
the central coordinating com
mittee.
Robert Walker, who now holds
both posts, said last night he had
"no general feeling" about the
value of the reforms. "I don't
think this will mean any great
change for the programs," Walker
commented.
Mark Weinberger, member of
the Overseas Campus Subcom
mittee said, "The Senate's action
will hopefully lead to far more
diversity, flexibility, and in
dependence for the educational
programs at the individual cam
puses. The danger still remains
that an undesirable degree of
uniformity may be enforced, but I
have great confidence that the
individual campuses, working
through the campus subcommit
tees, will be free to work out
imaginative and exciting new
programs."
Walker said he "was con
vinced" that the proposal adopted
was superior to an alternative
suggestion for strong subcom
mittees and a central committee
with almost no policy-making
power. For dealing with the
Senate, "one committee is more
practical and workable," Walker
said.

At least three students will be
included in the 11 voting mem
bers of the central committee; at
least two will join each of the
seven member program subcom
mittees.
With Academic Council Stand
ing Committee status, the com
mittee will regulate overseas
campuses in Britain, Germany and

Austria, study programs in Spain,
France and German", and a
prospective program in Mexico.
Stanford Press director Leon
Seltzer said last night he had "no
complaints" about organization of
the Committee on the University
Press. He foresaw no substantial
changes in its operation.

The Senate met yesterday from
3:15 to 6 p.m. in the Graduate
Business School.

Under the new foreign study
organization, the programs' chief
administrative officer will no
longer serve simultaneously as
chairman of the current policy
making Overseas Campus Sub
committee. He will merely be a
non-voting, ex officio member of
the central coordinating com
mittee.
Robert Walker, who now holds
both posts, said last night he had
"no general feeling" about the
value of the reforms. "I don't
think this will mean any great
change for the programs," Walker
commented.
Mark Weinberger, member of
the Overseas Campus Subcom
mittee said, "The Senate's action
will hopefully lead to far more
diversity, flexibility, and in
dependence for the educational
programs at the individual cam
puses. The danger still remains
that an undesirable degree of
uniformity may be enforced, but I
have great confidence that the
individual campuses, working
through the campus subcommit
tees, will be free to work out
imaginative and exciting new
programs."
Walker said he "was con
vinced" that the proposal adopted
was superior to an alternative
suggestion for strong subcom
mittees and a central committee
with almost no policy-making
power. For dealing with the
Senate, "one committee is more
practical and workable," Walker
said.

At least three students will be
included in the 11 voting mem
bers of the central committee; at
least two will join each of the
seven member program subcom
mittees.
With Academic Council Stand
ing Committee status, the com
mittee will regulate overseas
campuses in Britain, Germany and

Austria, study programs in Spain,
France and German", and a
prospective program in Mexico.
Stanford Press director Leon
Seltzer said last night he had "no
complaints" about organization of
the Committee on the University
Press. He foresaw no substantial
changes in its operation.
Bringing prolonged study and
tedious balancing to an end, the
Faculty Senate yesterday after
noon adopted a compromise pro
posal for decentralizing control of
the overseas campus program.
A central Foreign Study Pro
grams committee, with subcom
mittees representing each overseas
campus and study program, will
replace the single Overseas
Campus Subcommittee of the
General Studies Committee. Both
the subcommittee and the central
committee will be able to initiate
policy considerations, thus pro
viding more opportunity for
campuses to develop autonomous
programs especially suited for
their situations.
The Senate also took one step
toward dealing with the relation
ship between the University and
minority groups. The Senate
Committee on Committees was
instructed to study how to best
attack the problem—whether by
forming an Academic Council
committee, a University-wide
committee, or subcommittees of
existing committees.
In a third action, Senators
approved a charge to the Com
mittee on University Press. The
group both sets general policy and
holds ultimate authority for re
viewing prospective publications
of the Stanford Press. For the first
time it will include one student
member.
