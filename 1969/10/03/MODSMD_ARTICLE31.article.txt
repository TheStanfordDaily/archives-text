# Tribe Flies East
## Plunkett., Phipps To Duel 
### FRED MANN 
Tomorrow's football game
means absolutely nothing to
Stanford's quest for the Rose
Bowl bid—the absolute prize for
Pacific-8 universities. The
opponent is a team named, of all
things, the Boilermakers, and they
play in booming Lafayette,
Indiana. They finished tied for
third in their league last season,
have lost their top player through
graduation, and have no rivalry
with Stanford because the two
have never met before.
Yet for a number of reasons,

the eyes of every college football
fan in the country will be glued
on 68,000 seat Ross-Ade Stadium
in Lafayette tomorrow afternoon.
Purdue University (with an
enrollment of 24,700) will be out
to prove the experts both right
and wrong in the same stroke by
beating the Stanford Indians.
Purdue is the most unknown
quantity in all of college ball this
year. They have been ranked in
the top ten by two polls, the top
twenty by two others, and
ignored by four all together. After
their first two wins of the season,

they have been placed eighth by
AP while Stanford, also 2-0, are
16th.
The major incentive in the
fight will be for poll position and
national prestige. Both schools
have excellent shots at meeting
each other again on New Year's
Day in Pasadena. (Top ranked
Ohio State can not return to the
Rose Bowl this year due to Big
Ten regulations.)
It will be a test for the
predictors (who have made
Stanford a six-point underdog),
and also for the teams. A full
house is expected to see which
squad will continue on the road to
a perfect season.
It will also be a battle for
All-America berths. Two of the
top three quarterbacks in the land
will be on display, and the one
that comes out on top may very
well roll up the post-season
trophies. Mike Phipps, Jim
Plunkett, and SMU's Chuck
Hixson are leading candidates for
honors, and the Phipps-Plunkett
battle tomorrow should be a
passing war.
Currently Purdue's Phipps
ranks seventh in the nation in
total offense, gaining 622 yards in
two games, and Plunkett is 15th
with 446 yards. Jim, of course,
played only sparingly in the
second halves of both Tribe wins.
The Boilermakers' first game
was almost a shocking loss to

TCU, but a late touchdown saved
them, 42-35. Last week the
competition got tougher and so
did Purdue. They knocked off
rival Notre Dame, 28'-14, and
proved they are right up there
with the best. After Stanford
comes Michigan, a league game,
and Tribe mentor John Ralston is
hoping for a big Purdue let-down
this week.
All the predicted troubles for
both teams have not materialized
thus far. Stanford's inexperienced
defensive line has performed well.
Left end Jeff Siemon played only
two games as a frosh before a
serious knee injury sidelined him.
There was doubt if he would ever
play again. Left Tackle Dave
Tipton who had a great game
against Oregon had never played a
minute of college football until
two weeks ago, having transferred
from Gavilan College.
Big left guard Pete Lazetich
logged only a few minutes for last
year's frosh team and took a year
to get over a high school injury.
Right guard Tim McClure is the
only letterman in the front six,
but he gained his letter as a
linebacker.
Bill Alexander did not letter
last year, and right end Jack
Schultz is a converted running
back. Together this unit has
stopped their opponents on the
ground and has provided an
excellent pass rush.

Purdue figured to have
problems on the offensive line and
with, receivers. Of their top six
en<J prospects, only one had
caught a pass in varsity
competition all last year. But in
scoring 70 points in two games, it
appears the Boilermakers' troubles
have been cured.
It is a healthy Indian squad
that faces Purdue with only Tom
Sonnes still a question mark.
After the big Boilers get finished,
the visitors hopefully will still be
in good shape because next on the
schedule is Southern California.


JUST IN TIME—Jim Plunkett unloads a pass at the right moment, just before he
is clobbered. The great junior QH leads Stanford on'their first trip away i'rom
home tomorrow when they face Purdue. The Tribe is a six point underdog.

third in their league last season,
have lost their top player through
graduation, and have no rivalry
with Stanford because the two
have never met before.
Yet for a number of reasons,

the eyes of every college football
fan in the country will be glued
on 68,000 seat Ross-Ade Stadium
in Lafayette tomorrow afternoon.
Purdue University (with an
enrollment of 24,700) will be out
to prove the experts both right
and wrong in the same stroke by
beating the Stanford Indians.
Purdue is the most unknown
quantity in all of college ball this
year. They have been ranked in
the top ten by two polls, the top
twenty by two others, and
ignored by four all together. After
their first two wins of the season,

they have been placed eighth by
AP while Stanford, also 2-0, are
16th.
The major incentive in the
fight will be for poll position and
national prestige. Both schools
have excellent shots at meeting
each other again on New Year's
Day in Pasadena. (Top ranked
Ohio State can not return to the
Rose Bowl this year due to Big
Ten regulations.)
It will be a test for the
predictors (who have made
Stanford a six-point underdog),
and also for the teams. A full
house is expected to see which
squad will continue on the road to
a perfect season.
It will also be a battle for
All-America berths. Two of the
top three quarterbacks in the land
will be on display, and the one
that comes out on top may very
well roll up the post-season
trophies. Mike Phipps, Jim
Plunkett, and SMU's Chuck
Hixson are leading candidates for
honors, and the Phipps-Plunkett
battle tomorrow should be a
passing war.
Currently Purdue's Phipps
ranks seventh in the nation in
total offense, gaining 622 yards in
two games, and Plunkett is 15th
with 446 yards. Jim, of course,
played only sparingly in the
second halves of both Tribe wins.
The Boilermakers' first game
was almost a shocking loss to

TCU, but a late touchdown saved
them, 42-35. Last week the
competition got tougher and so
did Purdue. They knocked off
rival Notre Dame, 28'-14, and
proved they are right up there
with the best. After Stanford
comes Michigan, a league game,
and Tribe mentor John Ralston is
hoping for a big Purdue let-down
this week.
All the predicted troubles for
both teams have not materialized
thus far. Stanford's inexperienced
defensive line has performed well.
Left end Jeff Siemon played only
two games as a frosh before a
serious knee injury sidelined him.
There was doubt if he would ever
play again. Left Tackle Dave
Tipton who had a great game
against Oregon had never played a
minute of college football until
two weeks ago, having transferred
from Gavilan College.
Big left guard Pete Lazetich
logged only a few minutes for last
year's frosh team and took a year
to get over a high school injury.
Right guard Tim McClure is the
only letterman in the front six,
but he gained his letter as a
linebacker.
Bill Alexander did not letter
last year, and right end Jack
Schultz is a converted running
back. Together this unit has
stopped their opponents on the
ground and has provided an
excellent pass rush.

Purdue figured to have
problems on the offensive line and
with, receivers. Of their top six
en<J prospects, only one had
caught a pass in varsity
competition all last year. But in
scoring 70 points in two games, it
appears the Boilermakers' troubles
have been cured.
It is a healthy Indian squad
that faces Purdue with only Tom
Sonnes still a question mark.
After the big Boilers get finished,
the visitors hopefully will still be
in good shape because next on the
schedule is Southern California.


JUST IN TIME—Jim Plunkett unloads a pass at the right moment, just before he
is clobbered. The great junior QH leads Stanford on'their first trip away i'rom
home tomorrow when they face Purdue. The Tribe is a six point underdog.
Tomorrow's football game
means absolutely nothing to
Stanford's quest for the Rose
Bowl bid—the absolute prize for
Pacific-8 universities. The
opponent is a team named, of all
things, the Boilermakers, and they
play in booming Lafayette,
Indiana. They finished tied for
third in their league last season,
have lost their top player through
graduation, and have no rivalry
with Stanford because the two

in Lafayette tomorrow afternoon.
Purdue University (with an
enrollment of 24,700) will be out
to prove the experts both right
and wrong in the same stroke by
beating the Stanford Indians.
Purdue is the most unknown
quantity in all of college ball this
year. They have been ranked in
the top ten by two polls, the top
twenty by two others, and
ignored by four all together. After
their first two wins of the season,

they have been placed eighth by
AP while Stanford, also 2-0, are
16th.
The major incentive in the
fight will be for poll position and
national prestige. Both schools
have excellent shots at meeting
each other again on New Year's
Day in Pasadena. (Top ranked
Ohio State can not return to the
Rose Bowl this year due to Big
Ten regulations.)
It will be a test for the
predictors (who have made
Stanford a six-point underdog),
and also for the teams. A full
house is expected to see which
squad will continue on the road to
a perfect season.
It will also be a battle for
All-America berths. Two of the
top three quarterbacks in the land
will be on display, and the one
that comes out on top may very
well roll up the post-season
trophies. Mike Phipps, Jim
Plunkett, and SMU's Chuck
Hixson are leading candidates for
honors, and the Phipps-Plunkett
battle tomorrow should be a
passing war.
Currently Purdue's Phipps
ranks seventh in the nation in
total offense, gaining 622 yards in
two games, and Plunkett is 15th
with 446 yards. Jim, of course,
played only sparingly in the
second halves of both Tribe wins.
The Boilermakers' first game
was almost a shocking loss to

TCU, but a late touchdown saved
them, 42-35. Last week the
competition got tougher and so
did Purdue. They knocked off
rival Notre Dame, 28'-14, and
proved they are right up there
with the best. After Stanford
comes Michigan, a league game,
and Tribe mentor John Ralston is
hoping for a big Purdue let-down
this week.
All the predicted troubles for
both teams have not materialized
thus far. Stanford's inexperienced
defensive line has performed well.
Left end Jeff Siemon played only
two games as a frosh before a
serious knee injury sidelined him.
There was doubt if he would ever
play again. Left Tackle Dave
Tipton who had a great game
against Oregon had never played a
minute of college football until
two weeks ago, having transferred
from Gavilan College.
Big left guard Pete Lazetich
logged only a few minutes for last
year's frosh team and took a year
to get over a high school injury.
Right guard Tim McClure is the
only letterman in the front six,
but he gained his letter as a
linebacker.
Bill Alexander did not letter
last year, and right end Jack
Schultz is a converted running
back. Together this unit has
stopped their opponents on the
ground and has provided an
excellent pass rush.

Purdue figured to have
problems on the offensive line and
with, receivers. Of their top six
en<J prospects, only one had
caught a pass in varsity
competition all last year. But in
scoring 70 points in two games, it
appears the Boilermakers' troubles
have been cured.
It is a healthy Indian squad
that faces Purdue with only Tom
Sonnes still a question mark.
After the big Boilers get finished,
the visitors hopefully will still be
in good shape because next on the
schedule is Southern California.


JUST IN TIME—Jim Plunkett unloads a pass at the right moment, just before he
is clobbered. The great junior QH leads Stanford on'their first trip away i'rom
home tomorrow when they face Purdue. The Tribe is a six point underdog.
