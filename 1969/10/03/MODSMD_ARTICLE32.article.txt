## Scouting Report 
### FRED MANN (Fourth in a six part series) 
Somehow, football has never stolen all the headlines at the
University of California. Last year the Bears achieved their first
winning season in ten years, but it was overshadowed by the Third
World Strike, People's Park, and Ronnie Reagan. This year things may
be as active politically, and football may again fall on deaf ears, but at
least the public won't be missing as much.
To be sure, Berkeley will field a good ball club, but they will be
hard pressed to find the talent they had last go-round. Last year's big
publicity gimick, "The Bear Minimum" defense has been severely hit
by graduation. All-America Ed White and All-league Mike McCaffery
are in the pro ranks, as have offensive stars receivers Wayne Stewart
and Paul Williams.
Like nearly all other Pac-8 schools, Cal is still searching for a
quarterback. Experienced Randy Humphries can't seem to move the
team this year, and Steve Curtis, starter in last week's 17-14 upset win
over Indiana, is inconsistent. In the two Cal games so far (the first
being a 17-0 loss to Texas) the offense has accounted for only one
touchdown.
Steady but unspectacular veterans Bob Darby and Gary Fowler
lead the running backs. All of the pass-catchers are new, and can't do
too much if the ball doesn't get to them. The offensive line should be
better this season, led by guard Gerry Borgia.
If Cal is to make a move towards the title, the defense must carry
the load. Irby Augustine, a sure All-everything, anchors the depleted
line and should get help from 230 lbs. sophomore O.Z. White.
Linebacking could be a problem with Dennis Pitta gone. Ken
Wiedemann is the top deep back, and he saved the Indiana game with
two interceptions.
Predicted finish: stli place.
