## Alaska Bomb Blast 
### 
ANCHORaGE, Alaska
(AP)—The United States
detonated a one-megaton
thermonuclear device 4,000 feet
underground on the remote
Aleutian island of Amchitka
Thursday, without setting off the
earthquake some scientists had
feared.
The blast, set off only 700
miles from the Russian mainland,
registered 6.5 on the Richter
scale, a device for measuring
shock waves of seismic distur
bances. It was exactly the reading
the Atomic Energy Commission
had predicted.
Some scientists had protested
that the test might set off an
earthquake in the temblor-prone
Alaska and Aleutian faults and a
resulting tidal wave. The A EC had
prepared to issue an alert if this
had occurred.
Russia, Canada and Japan and
numerous factions in the United
States had protested the test. The
Soviet government newspaper
Izvestia charged Thursday the
blast posed a danger of setting off
earthquakes and tidal waves and
constituted a U.S. escalation of
the arms race.
The A EC indicated two more
tests would be conducted on the
island. The agency has not dis
closed the purpose, but Sen. J. W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., noted this

week reports that warheads of the
Spartan antiballistic missile would
be tested at the site.
• Haynsworth
WASHINGTON (AP)-Some
congressional sources said Thurs
day Judge Clement F. Hayns
worth was asking President Nixon
to withdraw his nomination to the
Supreme Court but the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee denied it.
The White House press office
said its latest information "indi
cates that this report is absolutely
untrue."
The congressional sources who
spoke of a proposed withdrawal
said the White House has taken an
informal poll of the Senate and
found at least 40 members pre
pared at this point to vote against
confirmation.
At the Senate, Republican
Charles E. Goodell of New York
and Democrat Walter Mondale of
Minnesota called on Nixon to
withdraw the nomination. Sen.
Thomas F. Eagleton, D-Mo., an
nounced he would vote against
Haynsworth.
Earlier in the day Nixon
relayed word through White
House press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler that he was standing
behind the nomination.

ANCHORaGE, Alaska
(AP)—The United States
detonated a one-megaton
thermonuclear device 4,000 feet
underground on the remote
Aleutian island of Amchitka
Thursday, without setting off the
earthquake some scientists had
feared.
The blast, set off only 700
miles from the Russian mainland,
registered 6.5 on the Richter
scale, a device for measuring
shock waves of seismic distur
bances. It was exactly the reading
the Atomic Energy Commission
had predicted.
Some scientists had protested
that the test might set off an
earthquake in the temblor-prone
Alaska and Aleutian faults and a
resulting tidal wave. The A EC had
prepared to issue an alert if this
had occurred.
Russia, Canada and Japan and
numerous factions in the United
States had protested the test. The
Soviet government newspaper
Izvestia charged Thursday the
blast posed a danger of setting off
earthquakes and tidal waves and
constituted a U.S. escalation of
the arms race.
The A EC indicated two more
tests would be conducted on the
island. The agency has not dis
closed the purpose, but Sen. J. W.
Fulbright, D-Ark., noted this

week reports that warheads of the
Spartan antiballistic missile would
be tested at the site.
• Haynsworth
WASHINGTON (AP)-Some
congressional sources said Thurs
day Judge Clement F. Hayns
worth was asking President Nixon
to withdraw his nomination to the
Supreme Court but the chairman
of the Senate Judiciary Com
mittee denied it.
The White House press office
said its latest information "indi
cates that this report is absolutely
untrue."
The congressional sources who
spoke of a proposed withdrawal
said the White House has taken an
informal poll of the Senate and
found at least 40 members pre
pared at this point to vote against
confirmation.
At the Senate, Republican
Charles E. Goodell of New York
and Democrat Walter Mondale of
Minnesota called on Nixon to
withdraw the nomination. Sen.
Thomas F. Eagleton, D-Mo., an
nounced he would vote against
Haynsworth.
Earlier in the day Nixon
relayed word through White
House press secretary Ronald L.
Ziegler that he was standing
behind the nomination.
