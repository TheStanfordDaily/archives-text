# ASSU's Pat Shea Studies Tensions
## 
### 
"America is in jeopardy of
being suspended by an illiterate
and ignorant right-wing move
ment."
Pat Shea says this is a major
reason he joined the Special
Committee on Campus Tensions
which was recently formed by the
American Council on Education
(ACE). According to Shea, an
ASSU Council of Presidents
member, "this is the first com
mittee of its kind trying to
establish working arrangements to
ease campus tensions." ACE Presi
dent Logan Wilson invited Shea to
join the group.
The committee will study the
causes of campus disorders, which
Shea feels are national problems.
"The real solutions to campus
tensions lie in the reordering of
national priorities—the draft, war,
poverty, and racism need to be
dealt with.' He added that there
"will be some concentration on
the problems of demonstrations
themselves and how to equitably
deal with them."
Shea debated with himself at
some length before accepting the
position. He "would prefer to do
something at the local level, but
sometimes a national policy is
needed . . .American education is
a delicate thing—just look at how
it fell apart during the McCarthy
era." Shea was in Washington,
D.C. this summer and "was
alarmed at how ill-informed the
McClellan committee was." The
type of thinking of men such as
McClellan, Thurmond, and East
land was particularly disturbing.
The committee has already had
one meeting, which Shea says
"was almost like an encounter
group, everybody was talking so
straight." More sessions are
planned before a final report is
releases next April. Since the
committee isn't responsible to a

particular person or agency, Shea
hopes that it will pull no punches.
Shea discounts grumblings
from some critics who cite the
moderate-liberal membership of
the committee, even with radical
spokesman such as former Berk
eley Student Body President
Charles Palmer, now National
Student Association president.
"The university is like a clois
tered community," Shea re
sponds. "Students infrequently
are able to gain a wider perspec
tive as is represented in the larger
community. Although the com
mittee may seem moderate to
Stanford, on a national level this
is a drastic step forward for
universities to begin to define
their own internal mechanisms
without the unwanted help of the
federal and state governments.
"Radical" Reports Unheeded
Shea points to such moderate
groups as the Eisenhower Com
mission on Violence, the Chicago
Commission on the 1968 riots,
and the Rock Commission, a
wholly Republican congressional
group studying campus disorders.
Each commission came out with
reports that were radical to Shea's
way of thinking.
However, their reports were
largely unheeded, and Shea
realizes the committee might be
"disregarded." But he hopes "that
by getting together some people
with potentially good ideas,
exciting and well enough based,
others will be stimulated enough
to implement some of the ideas."
Sol Linowitz, chairman of the
committee and former American
Ambassador to the OAS, said that
"the spiral of campus violence
must be broken if American
higher education is to avoid a
backlash that will destroy it as an
intellectual enterprise and vital
national resource."
