# Transfer, Grad Housing Shortage Remains
## 
### GREG WHITE First Of Two Parts 
"Stanford is a resident campus . . says
the handbook, but this year over 6,200
students—transfers, undergrads, and grad
uates—have had to seek housing off
campus. Some are still looking, though
classes have already started.
One such homeless transfer is Celia, a
Junior transfer from Berkeley. She says
that "the first I knew of a housing shortage
was about August when I got a little letter
telling me to go to some clearing house."
Disappointed and confused, she "almost
didn't come to Stanford because of that."
Celia, who told her story while search
ing the housing listings in Encina, went on
to say that "when I came here in
September it was a mess in the clearing
house . . .it was more that we helped
ourselves—the clearinghouse just had stuff
to look up. But it was great that I had that
help."
That help proved fruitless, and Celia is
still looking for a place. Until she finds one
she is staying at a friend's apartment.
Itiegcst Problem
Transfers and grads do have the biggest
problem in finding living quarters. About
350 transfers are here this quarter, with
some 200 of them on University residence
waiting lists. So far, only about fifty have
been helped. More may be accomodated
later when the dorm confusion settles. The
rest must look off campus.
Graduate enrollment is 4,780. There are
600 spaces available on campus for the
unmarried among them, and 739 apart

ments in Escondido Village are reserved for
married grads. This means that 3,500
graduates need housing. Most made ar
rangements last quarter, but many came
empty handed this fall.
To help the grads and transfers, a
Housing Clearing House was set up in Serra
House September 12. Gretchen Campbell,
assistant to the dean of students, reports
that around 300 students were housed in
Stern while looking for housing. During its
first few days of operation, the clearing
house placed half of them in homes,
fraternities, and local apartments.
Clearinghouse Closed
In fact, the clearinghouse closed down a
week early because only a few students
were using it by pre-reg week. This was due
in part to the fact that most of the
available low-renting off-catnpus housing
had been occupied. A great many of these
openings came as a result of a plea
contained in a letter sent out by Assistant
Dean of Students Bill Leland.
Leland's letter, dated August 20, was
sent to "Alumni and friends" of Stanford.
It described the shortage and asked these
people to consider renting empty rooms to
students (without regard of race, creed,
etc.). There was a good response to this
letter, especially since most of the rooms
offered were for low rents of $30-$5O a
month. Most were taken immediately by
clearinghouse patrons.
Even with this help, the shortage
remained. Rewa Hidden, in the off-campus
housing office in Encina, reports "tons" of
students still coming in looking for

off-campus living places. Most of the
homeless are transfers and grads; many are
bunked out in fraternities or on friend's
couches.
Shortage and High Rent
The trouble these people face is
two-fold. First, few new apartments have
been constructed in the Stanford area.
Those built (some on Stanford property)
cater not to students but to the many
people drawn to the Peninsula by the
science-oriented industries. They can afford
the high rents that students cannot.
Second, the choice housing has already
been snapped up; what remains is either far
away in Sunnyvale, Cupertino, or San
Carlos, or is priced too high. A quick check
of the listings available at Encina shows
apartments ranged from lows of $75-$9O
per month to $175 per month and $450
per quarter (per person). Few students are
prepared to pay such prices. Nobody really
knows how many students are affected,
but the number is not small.
Unfortunately, according to Dan
Williams, assistant dean of students, the
problem is worse for the female transfer
than for the male. So far fifty males have
been placed by the Old Union Housing
Office, as compared to ten last year. Yet,
there are only ten females who have
secured housing through William's office.
Many more are still looking. Williams
speculates that the problem is due in part
to the flexibility that women show in their
housing preferences.

housing situation will be reviewed.)

Even with this help, the shortage
remained. Rewa Hidden, in the off-campus
housing office in Encina, reports "tons" of
students still coming in looking for

off-campus living places. Most of the
homeless are transfers and grads; many are
bunked out in fraternities or on friend's
couches.
Shortage and High Rent
The trouble these people face is
two-fold. First, few new apartments have
been constructed in the Stanford area.
Those built (some on Stanford property)
cater not to students but to the many
people drawn to the Peninsula by the
science-oriented industries. They can afford
the high rents that students cannot.
Second, the choice housing has already
been snapped up; what remains is either far
away in Sunnyvale, Cupertino, or San
Carlos, or is priced too high. A quick check
of the listings available at Encina shows
apartments ranged from lows of $75-$9O
per month to $175 per month and $450
per quarter (per person). Few students are
prepared to pay such prices. Nobody really
knows how many students are affected,
but the number is not small.
Unfortunately, according to Dan
Williams, assistant dean of students, the
problem is worse for the female transfer
than for the male. So far fifty males have
been placed by the Old Union Housing
Office, as compared to ten last year. Yet,
there are only ten females who have
secured housing through William's office.
Many more are still looking. Williams
speculates that the problem is due in part
to the flexibility that women show in their
housing preferences.

housing situation will be reviewed.)


Oil FOR SII.FNCK Three studenta relax in their IMan/anita Park trailer. The trailers are not quite as desirable as tliey
look since their walls are extremely thin, and there are only three desks for the lour students living in each trailer. Many
are glad however to have any on campus housing since a numlier of students are without any housing at all.
"Stanford is a resident campus . . says
the handbook, but this year over 6,200
students—transfers, undergrads, and grad
uates—have had to seek housing off
campus. Some are still looking, though
classes have already started.
One such homeless transfer is Celia, a
Junior transfer from Berkeley. She says
that "the first I knew of a housing shortage
was about August when I got a little letter
telling me to go to some clearing house."
Disappointed and confused, she "almost
didn't come to Stanford because of that."
Celia, who told her story while search
ing the housing listings in Encina, went on
to say that "when I came here in
September it was a mess in the clearing
house . . .it was more that we helped
ourselves—the clearinghouse just had stuff
to look up. But it was great that I had that
help."
That help proved fruitless, and Celia is
still looking for a place. Until she finds one
she is staying at a friend's apartment.
Itiegcst Problem
Transfers and grads do have the biggest
problem in finding living quarters. About
350 transfers are here this quarter, with
some 200 of them on University residence
waiting lists. So far, only about fifty have
been helped. More may be accomodated
later when the dorm confusion settles. The
rest must look off campus.
Graduate enrollment is 4,780. There are
600 spaces available on campus for the
unmarried among them, and 739 apart

ments in Escondido Village are reserved for
married grads. This means that 3,500
graduates need housing. Most made ar
rangements last quarter, but many came
empty handed this fall.
To help the grads and transfers, a
Housing Clearing House was set up in Serra
House September 12. Gretchen Campbell,
assistant to the dean of students, reports
that around 300 students were housed in
Stern while looking for housing. During its
first few days of operation, the clearing
house placed half of them in homes,
fraternities, and local apartments.
Clearinghouse Closed
In fact, the clearinghouse closed down a
week early because only a few students
were using it by pre-reg week. This was due
in part to the fact that most of the
available low-renting off-catnpus housing
had been occupied. A great many of these
openings came as a result of a plea
contained in a letter sent out by Assistant
Dean of Students Bill Leland.
Leland's letter, dated August 20, was
sent to "Alumni and friends" of Stanford.
It described the shortage and asked these
people to consider renting empty rooms to
students (without regard of race, creed,
etc.). There was a good response to this
letter, especially since most of the rooms
offered were for low rents of $30-$5O a
month. Most were taken immediately by
clearinghouse patrons.
Even with this help, the shortage
remained. Rewa Hidden, in the off-campus

still looking for a place. Until she finds one
she is staying at a friend's apartment.
Itiegcst Problem
Transfers and grads do have the biggest
problem in finding living quarters. About
350 transfers are here this quarter, with
some 200 of them on University residence
waiting lists. So far, only about fifty have
been helped. More may be accomodated
later when the dorm confusion settles. The
rest must look off campus.
Graduate enrollment is 4,780. There are
600 spaces available on campus for the
unmarried among them, and 739 apart

ments in Escondido Village are reserved for
married grads. This means that 3,500
graduates need housing. Most made ar
rangements last quarter, but many came
empty handed this fall.
To help the grads and transfers, a
Housing Clearing House was set up in Serra
House September 12. Gretchen Campbell,
assistant to the dean of students, reports
that around 300 students were housed in
Stern while looking for housing. During its
first few days of operation, the clearing
house placed half of them in homes,
fraternities, and local apartments.
Clearinghouse Closed
In fact, the clearinghouse closed down a
week early because only a few students
were using it by pre-reg week. This was due
in part to the fact that most of the
available low-renting off-catnpus housing
had been occupied. A great many of these
openings came as a result of a plea
contained in a letter sent out by Assistant
Dean of Students Bill Leland.
Leland's letter, dated August 20, was
sent to "Alumni and friends" of Stanford.
It described the shortage and asked these
people to consider renting empty rooms to
students (without regard of race, creed,
etc.). There was a good response to this
letter, especially since most of the rooms
offered were for low rents of $30-$5O a
month. Most were taken immediately by
clearinghouse patrons.
Even with this help, the shortage
remained. Rewa Hidden, in the off-campus
housing office in Encina, reports "tons" of
students still coming in looking for

off-campus living places. Most of the
homeless are transfers and grads; many are
bunked out in fraternities or on friend's
couches.
Shortage and High Rent
The trouble these people face is
two-fold. First, few new apartments have
been constructed in the Stanford area.
Those built (some on Stanford property)
cater not to students but to the many
people drawn to the Peninsula by the
science-oriented industries. They can afford
the high rents that students cannot.
Second, the choice housing has already
been snapped up; what remains is either far
away in Sunnyvale, Cupertino, or San
Carlos, or is priced too high. A quick check
of the listings available at Encina shows
apartments ranged from lows of $75-$9O
per month to $175 per month and $450
per quarter (per person). Few students are
prepared to pay such prices. Nobody really
knows how many students are affected,
but the number is not small.
Unfortunately, according to Dan
Williams, assistant dean of students, the
problem is worse for the female transfer
than for the male. So far fifty males have
been placed by the Old Union Housing
Office, as compared to ten last year. Yet,
there are only ten females who have
secured housing through William's office.
Many more are still looking. Williams
speculates that the problem is due in part
to the flexibility that women show in their
housing preferences.
(Monday the undergraduate, on-campus
housing situation will be reviewed.)


Oil FOR SII.FNCK Three studenta relax in their IMan/anita Park trailer. The trailers are not quite as desirable as tliey
look since their walls are extremely thin, and there are only three desks for the lour students living in each trailer. Many
are glad however to have any on campus housing since a numlier of students are without any housing at all.
"Stanford is a resident campus . . says
the handbook, but this year over 6,200
students—transfers, undergrads, and grad
uates—have had to seek housing off
campus. Some are still looking, though
classes have already started.
One such homeless transfer is Celia, a
Junior transfer from Berkeley. She says
that "the first I knew of a housing shortage
was about August when I got a little letter
telling me to go to some clearing house."
Disappointed and confused, she "almost
didn't come to Stanford because of that."
Celia, who told her story while search
ing the housing listings in Encina, went on
to say that "when I came here in
September it was a mess in the clearing
house . . .it was more that we helped
ourselves—the clearinghouse just had stuff
to look up. But it was great that I had that
help."
That help proved fruitless, and Celia is
still looking for a place. Until she finds one
she is staying at a friend's apartment.
