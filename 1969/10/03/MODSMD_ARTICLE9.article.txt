## Bubbling 
### 
The Daily appears to be the same old Daily this fall. But bubbling
beneath the surface, a number of ideas and experiments are helping to
reshape the Stanford community's morning newspaper.
First, and most immediate, is the new typesetting shop installed
over the summer in the Daily's back rooms, complete with three
full-time employees and part-time student help; The ASSU
Typesetting Shop, as it is called, will operate on a cooperative basis
for The Daily, Chaparral, the black Students' Colonist, and other
student publications. The shop should greatly bolster the fiscal
self-sufficiency of student publications.
Our second 1 hrust is greater participation in The Daily by all parts
of the University. In the past, the parochial interests of our staff
members have dictated the paper's contents. We are now contacting
faculty and staff groups to encourage them to submit letters, columns,
and articles for publication, looking toward the day when The Daily
can become a true community newspaper. Faculty and staff, and
often students, have felt a great deal of hesitancy about expressing
ideas through The Daily's pages, either from fear that their copy
would be mistreated or from disagreement with Daily editorial bias.
That bias will undoubtedly live on, but our opinion pages are open to
expression of literally any point of view.
A bit further in the future, wc are looking toward the day that the
paper will become financially and legally independent of the
Associated Students, The Daily's current legal owners and publishers.
We have gained support for an independence move from a number of
faculty and administrators, in addition to the upcoming Study of
Education at Stanford report on extra-curricular activities.
Independence will replace the currently ambiguous and potentially
dangerous alliance inherent in the student legislature's position as
Daily publisher and censor. Instead, the paper has hopes of
establishing a clearly-defined and responsible corporation, headed by a
governing board of students and faculty.
In the interim until a responsible independent position is achieved,
The Daily is experimenting with new and exciting forms of governing
itself. We are attempting to de-emphasize the hierarchical aspects of a
bureaucracy such as a newspaper staff, concentrating rather on
promoting fuller participation of even the least experienced staffer.
It's part of a move away from the days of the heretofore
institutionalized arrangement that placed power and authority in a
person's possession simply because of his position in The Daily
hierarchy. Those days arc ending.
Come in and sec what we' e all about.
