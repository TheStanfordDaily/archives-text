H Isn't that ridiculous?
American promotional genius knows no bounds!
But seriously, batteries do not last forever, even
, though not used. So if you have any device that
works off the little devils, it really is a good idea
to test them periodically, especially if they've been
resting on the shelf.
Bring your batteries to Lafayette. We'll test them
free. And if you need replacements, we have them
at wholesale prices. Nationally famous brands too
Everready, Everready Golden Alkaline, and Mal
lory Duracells—all at wholesale prices.
So stop paying high prices for batteries and
other electronic needs—come to Lafayette and
save!
