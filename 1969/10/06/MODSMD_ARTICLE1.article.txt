# Council Supports Senate On Research, Language
## 
### SIGOURNEY WEAVER 
Present guidelines abolishing
classified research on campus were
accepted by the Academic
Council on Friday.
The Council voted, however, to
advance the annual review of
research policy from next spring
to this autumn.

At the same meeting, the
faculty, voted against holding a
referendum on the dropping of a
university-wide foreign language
requirement.
The voting followed a report by
President Pitzer citing Stanford's
progress in reducing secret campus
research and in directing efforts
"towards the societal and
environmental problems of the
country and the world."
Pitzer said that out of thirteen
classified research projects based
at Stanford last spring when the
Senate adopted new research
guidelines, three of these projects
have been declassified, three have
been declared in accordance with
the new guidelines since their
classified information is
"peripheral" to the actual studies,
and five more contracts will be
terminated by December 31,
1969.
Negotiations are proceeding on
the remaining two contracts. In
one of these the researchers
involved wish to transfer their
work to the Stanford Research
Institute. Stanford has made a
subcontract with SRI until March
15, 1970 "to facilitate this
transfer."
Pitzer has approved a one-year
extension of the remaining
contract on its present classified
form because "it has proven
difficult to find a suitable
framework for the classified
activities consistent with retention
by Stanford of the unclassified
facilities and program."
Leo Sapirstein, Professor of
Physiology, introduced a
substitute resolution to replace
the previous proposal of a mail
ballot of the faculty on whether

or not to rescind the secret
research ban petitioned for last
spring by 85 faculty members.
The substitute resolution
proposed that the Council ask the
Academic Senate Committee on
Research Policy to review the
present research guidelines this
autumn and report its findings to
the Senate and to the Council.
80% of the petitioners who
were reached favored the
substitute resolution.
The Council passed the
resolution by voice vote.
Pat Shea, President of the
ASSU Council of Presidents, felt
that the substitute proposal
avoided the issue.
"It would be a shame," Shea
said afterward, "if all Academic
Council Members felt it necessary
to review all controversial
decisions already investigated and
discussed and voted upon by the
Senate. Many people in the
Stanford community don't have
enough faith in their
decision-making processes to let
them work."
Clebsch Pleased
Senate Chairman William
Clebsch was pleased with the
meeting. "The Senate had arrived
at a policy which was adopted in
some haste," he said later. "It is
appropriate that the Senate review
its decisions at least once a year
and in the autumn. The review
mechanism is always
appropriate."
Any decision of the Academic
Senate is subject to a review by
the all-faculty Academic Council
upon a petition from 50 petitions.
Following much floor
discussion, the Council voted
114-90 against holding a

referendum on the
university-wide foreign language
requirement which was ended by
a vote of the Senate last June.
The Senate strongly
recommended the study of
foreign languages in its new
guidelines and individual
departments are free to include
such study in their departmental
requirements.
Senate Chairman Clebsch
defended the new requirements
that became effective Spetember
1, 1969 as "the most far-reaching
reform of undergraduate
education at Stanford in more
than a decade."
"The underlying principles are
two," said Clebsch. "First, that
freshmen should be full citizens of
the University and not 13th grade
high school students; second, that
there is no discoverable norm for
The Educated Man but there are
many ways of becoming educated
men and women."
In his statement to the Council,
Pitzer noted the increasing
support for bold, new educational
programs such as the recently
announced program in Human
Biology and the university's
progress in recruiting students and
teachers from minority groups.
"The Freshman class this year
contains 63 black students and 71
of Mexican-American background,
the largest number in the
University's history," said Pitzer.
Pitzer also acknowledged that
he had taken personal
responsibility in guiding the
progress of the ban on secret
research. Special financial
arrangements are being made for
those staff members who would
otherwise suffer in this transition.
