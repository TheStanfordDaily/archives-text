## The 						Agonizing Israeli Reality 
### 
Editor, THE DAILY:
Israel's foreign policy is re
formed too easily and deceptively
in Dan Snell's 'Letter from Israel'
(Daily, Oct. 1). Mr. Snell contends
that Israel's policy of reprisal
must end if a path is to be cleared
to a peaceful settlement.
This analysis, however, presents
Israeli reprisal as further aggressive
action which serves only to
aggravate the present situation.
This is not so. Israeli reprisal
(aimed almost exclusively at
material, not at people) is de
fensive, seeking to curtail the
activities of guerillas and national
forces threatening Israel's ex
istence or the lives of individual
citizens.
It is quite true, as Mr. Snell
points out, that young Israelis
rarely attack government policy as
we do, even after they enter
Israeli colleges. It is also true, as
Mr. Snell notes with some disdain,
that in terms of military opera
tions Israelis think in much
simpler terms than we do.
People in Israel need not
become entangled in the type of
geopolitical complexities that we
suffer from in our lives. The
agonizing reality for Israel is in
many ways simpler; a reality faced

day to day and minute to minute:
survival.

Open Letter to Dumke
Dear Chancellor Dumke;
I would like to give you, in my
opinion, a few reasons why
students are demonstrating. I
recently attended college in Cali
fornia and remember many poor
teachers and a few good ones.
These many teachers, probably
due to personal frustrations in
life, could not relate the subject
material to the class. Their lec
tures and exams were nebulous
trash; many good explanatory
text books in comparison would
show this. The teachers would go
as far as to pick unclear, volum
inous texts that might make sense
to some one in the field for
several years. They would dive in
too deep and too fast, without
clarity, into the subject, and cause
confusion.
To pass the class, you would
memorize, not necessarily under
stand, conform to the teacher's
personality, "polish the apple,"

etc., and true individualism was
stamped out. What was really
needed was cyclic education
where the student would get
overall covering of the subject,
returning to its various parts
several times, gradually going
deeper, with good and sincere
guidance from the instructor, and
not with just one facet of a
teacher's research project. The
student would be more enthused
and would get a more lasting
impression. Instead, he is shown
some trees, not the forest. The

resultant confused class in many
cases makes the teacher feel
superior to it and to the world.
You may ask, why would a
teacher want to do such a thing?
Well, for the above frustrations I
have implied and also to keep his
job as his way of grading suits the
"establishment." His nebulous
lectures and unstandardized
exams (essay and paragraph
answer types which can be graded
anyway depending on how he
personally feels towards each
student) also serve to "flunk out"
the great majority of the confused
freshman class.
End Result
The end result is that a
relatively small amount graduate
with good grades and the law
schools, medical schools, etc.,
have an excuse to refuse admit
tance. This keeps the number in
society's elite down (supply and
demand) and allows the profes
sionals and other affluents to keep
their powerful place in society by
financial and social advantages. I
think all knowledge and skills
should be passed on freely to all
who wish it, not to be denied to
suit the establishment.
The counter to this latter
statement is that we would then
get poor quality medical, legal,
etc., services. Well, the quality is
not that excellent now, it does
not require a monopoly to obtain
it, and opening the doors would
not hurt it, perhaps improve it.
practically all people are about
the same except for a social
economical environmental back
ground brought on by the estab
lishment, Royalty in old days.
Since I have left school, I have
seen a continuation of this unfair
ness: high and mighty profes
sionals and affluents whose mis
takes are covered up while certain
law enforcers and supporting
citizens eagerly gas and club
"communist conspiring" student
demonstrators; unstandardized
state examinations which are a
clear violation of the 14th
amendment to the U.S. Constitu
tion; a war in Vietnam clearly
being fought for political conota
tions at home.
Governor Reagan's speech last
June 13th against the campus
demonstrators was full of lopsided
statements.

Lopsided Statements
He does not, nor will he ever
understand the real issues (Read:
The Lessons of History by
Durants). He's in a world of his
own of large real estate holdings,
high society back yard barbecues,
and away from the smog, poverty,
and conjection of the city. The
few progressive issues that he now
"champions" would have been
ignored by the contented estab
lishment that he represents were it
not for the demonstrations. He
says the students are misguided by
a "radical few." Well, every
political movement and organiza
tion has its small nucleus;
Reagan's advisors are one.
Repression of students is not
the answer as many such as
Reagan, U.S. Attorney General
Mitchell, General Park of South
Korea, and ruling classes of Latin
America, most news media heads
(all from high society) want, but
more fairness in both schools and
the working world, and the
stopping of the present favortism
in all branches of government to
the small elite who are not
necessarily the most qualified.
This, in my opinion, would make
a more overall healthy society.
