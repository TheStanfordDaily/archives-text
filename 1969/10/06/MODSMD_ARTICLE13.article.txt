# Inside, Looking Out
## Shells, Reality & Friedlander 
### David Fidanque 
Each of us had a very hard shell to protect us
from both the unknown and the known which we
either fear or dislike.
We all know this; it is taken for granted. A
biology teacher I once had said that the only
things that were common to all living beings were
the drive for self-survival and protection. I felt it
then that that was somewhat of an oversimplifica
tion and yet it is out of that urge for self-survival
that we build our shell. After all, how could we
survive if we didn't instinctively protect ourselves
against things that might destroy us either
physically of psychologically?
But the question is no longer simply one of
survival. We have already decided (or someone has
anyway )that psychological survival is more im
portant than physical. With the reality of the
possibility of instant destruction, we have chosen
to ignore that possibility for fear of destroying
ourselves psychologically.
Why Worry?
Why worry about dying? When it comes, it
comes. There's nothing you can do about it, right?
So, why worry? Just live your life and be happy
and hope you're happy when you die. And
besides, no one is insane enough to start an atomic
war. The bombs are there to protect us. Well, of
course they are, but you know even if we wanted
to we couldn't get rid of them. Shells . . .bombs
have shells, too. How fragile are theirs?
Although we all know we use shells for
protection there is nothing that can arouse
resentment in us more quickly than having them
attacked or pointed out to us. This is what was the
significance of what happened in Larry Fried
lander's Contemporary Drama class last Thrusday.
If you weren't there, your reaction upon
learning about it was probably rather detached
(That sounds really fantastic. Maybe I'll take that
class after all.)
However, if you were there, you know that it
wasn't cool; it was hell, and it still is.
Actors Disrupt Class
A class was disrupted by a relatively small
number of "actors" with the aid of the professor
in charge. The unknowing half-awake students of
the class responded instinctively as anyone should
have expected; they rallied to the defense of a
popular professor who was being attacked.
Our shells, which were in great shape, worked
beautifully. We got gotten up to listen to a lecture
from a guy we liked and respected and that was all
we got up for. We did not expect to be faced with
questions of academic reform or battling the
inertia of bureaucracy and our shells came to our
defense. As much as we may have sympathized
with the views expressed or those expressing them
it just didn't seem like the right time or the right
place for it. We were too vulnerable. We felt
resentment and emotions won our over intellect.
Prof Blows Whistle
When blew his whistle, we froze as woll az>
the "actors". No one had moved an inch to stop a

fight going on right in front of us. The whistle let
us off the hook and resolved the immediate
conflict inside our shells. We were thankful for
that and applauded for lack of any other way of
expressing it. But we weren't really let off the
hook at all; our shells just told us we were.
("They're only acting. Oh. Good job. I was worried
for a while there. I can relax now.") For the
"actors" told us that there had been no script and
no parts; Everyone had merely let their own
feelings come out.
The only thing that seemed to make it a play was
that it had been planned ahead of time and there
had been two run-throughs. Was it a play at all?
Even if the actors didn't believe what they were
saying, the audience took them seriously as if it
were a real situation.
Can something be considered a play if it is real?
Or was it a political act? Are the two necessarily
incompatible? Can one be absolved of all
responsibility for manipulating people's minds by
merely stating that it's all make-beleive?
Mixed Feelings
My feelings since Thursday morning have been
very mixed and I have by no moans resolved that
conflict. I don't expect to.
One part of me feels resentful of being
confronted with things in myself that I don't like
even though I know it can be a very healthy thing.
Another part of mo feels resentful that I was let
oft the hook as easily as I was by that whistle.
I am very sorry that once confronted with a
deep conflict within myself 1 wasn't quite allowed
to solve that right then and there. It was the act of
being thrown out of context that had made it
almost impossible to do it since.
It is only by being confronted in a real situation
that one can ever find out for sure about some
things. And when one can no longer trust one's
perception of the reality of the situation, it
becomes increasingly difficult to perceive oneself
either within any situation or outside of it.
No ('.lit and Dry Answers
I'm not sure how healthy that is, nor am I sure
that anyone can or should be held morally
responsible for it. There are no cut and dry
answers; there are only questions.
As far as I am concerned, Thursday's class can
be justified as an educational experience. Everyone
that was there has now felt contemporary drama
and can begin to perceive its implications. No
amount of reading or listening to lecturers could
have given us that experience. One final question
that I feel must be asked is whether or not
contemporary drama can go or had gone too far?
Intellectually I feel that at least as long as the
world situation remains as volatile as it it, that it
cannot, but my shell, which is on its last legs, tells
me that it already has.
