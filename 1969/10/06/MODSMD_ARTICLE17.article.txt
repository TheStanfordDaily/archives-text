## Triumphant Traviata 
### RICK ATKINS 
The San Francisco Opera is
currently in its forty-seventh
season, and very possibly this
year's l-a Traviata may rank as
one of its more impressive pro
ductions. Traviata is a product of
that prolific music man of the
nineteenth century, Giuseppe
Verdi. The story is adapted from a
Dumas novelette, and it is typ
ically one of the ad nauseum
tragic tales of that time. Musical
ly, however, the opera is some
thing else; it is full of exquisite
orchestral leitmotif with rich
underlying vocal li«*l canto.
La Traviata was a box office
sellout this year. If you're the
type of person who can't tolerate
the thought of old Jeanette
Mac Donald movies, consider your
self lucky to have missed this
story—last Saturday night was its
final performance. But if you're
the type of person who becomes
turned on by musical master
peices, you have undoubtedly
missed a rare treat this season.

Violetta Valery is the heroine
of this opera, a sort of nineteenth
century Parisian Pearl Mesta. The
action begins with a large party
taking place in Violetta's salon
with guests and spirits (liquid
rather than levitating) abounding.
It is not long before we learn
Violetta's major shortcoming: in a
coughing fit that could only be
duplicated in an anti-smoking
commercial for the American
Cancer Society, she displays to us
a rather nasty case of acute
consumption. Alfredo Germont, a
guest at the party and iminently
Violetta's overpassionate lover,
rushes to her side and declares—of
all things—his undying love for
her. From this moment on we are
deeply entrenched in mush.
The plot is fairly straight-line
throughout; only occasionally
does it become invaginated with
the slightest bit of intrigue and
suspense: Hoy meets girl, boy falls
in love with girl (reciprocally
engaging), as a concomitant the
girl is probably dying. And then
the intrigue: Boy's father is a real
proper Parisian pere.
It seems that Alfredo's sister
wants to marry a fairly prominent
man-about-town, and it occurs to
the elder Germont that Violetta
and Alfredo, living together in
fairly open secrecy, are doing
nothing to enhance the purity of
the family name. So girl leaves
boy and goes to the big city ; there
girl finds a more socially inclined
companion (those are nice words).
As expected, Alfredo comes
marching in, assesses the situation,
and promptly challenges the new
comer to a duel.
As the last scene opens we can
infer that Alfredo has come away
from the shooting match un
harmed. Several months have
obviously elapsed since that time
because Violetta's cough is notice
ably worse. The heroine bemoans
Alfredo's disappearance, claiming
that she really only loved him.
Musically she expounds her
desire for his swift return—which
naturally is a no-sooner-said-than
done occurrence. But, alas, the
consumption is too great an
obstacle, medicine being what it
was in the nineteenth century,
and she dies in Alfredo's arms.
Truly a stunning story that only
Ronald Reagan could love!
Un the other hand we have
three hours of musical ecstacy,

not to mention magnificent ex
amples of gala operatic produc
tion. Jeanette Pilou played as
astoundingly good Violetta with a
powerful soprano delivery. The
colaratura demanded of her role
at the end of the first was
superb, and one couldn't help but
say at the end of her "Sempre
Libera," "Don't you wish everyone
could sing like that?" The tre
mendously exciting thing about
Jeanette Pilou, aside from ability
to sing, is her ability to act. She
unquestionably gets into Violetta;
she understands what makes that
character tick
When compared to Pilou every
one else was quite weak—in the
acting department anyway. Her
Alfredo, Franco Bonisolli was a
distinctively wooden actor. He
sang quite well during the first
act—and indeed quite well
throughout, but noticeable varia
tions in his performance began
during the second act. At the
beginning of the act he started to
anticipate his long notes, seem
ingly well ahead of the orchestra,
as though he were deliberately
trying to show his audience how
talented his vocal chords really
are. He didn't have to do that; his
tenor is terrific. One cannot help
but wonder if he weren't some
how competing with Pilou and
Wixell for applause. There were
short periods where his voice was
noticeably strained, as though
trying to master a volume level
exhibited by Pilou and Wixell
which he would not attain.
At the end of his "Di Pro
vensa," I heard someone say of
Ingvar Wixell, "Wasn't he great?"
As the elder Germont, he was
precisely that—very unlike the
Wixell one recalls of two years
ago. His performance was much
more polished both in terms of
singing and acting. His voice was
in such good form in Traviata, one
cannot help but suspect that he
may be, as a baritone, matchless
this season. But there is one
annoying trait of the old Wixell
still left—his proclivity to taking
much more than furtive glances at
the prompter's box. His move
ments are so oriented on stage as
to wedge his head into that little
space on center stage at least
twenty separate times a minute. If
he would cut that single thing out
of his repertoire, his performances
would become significantly more
improved.

not to mention magnificent ex

astoundingly good Violetta with a
powerful soprano delivery. The
colaratura demanded of her role
at the end of the first was
superb, and one couldn't help but
say at the end of her "Sempre
Libera," "Don't you wish everyone
could sing like that?" The tre
mendously exciting thing about
Jeanette Pilou, aside from ability
to sing, is her ability to act. She
unquestionably gets into Violetta;
she understands what makes that
character tick
When compared to Pilou every
one else was quite weak—in the
acting department anyway. Her
Alfredo, Franco Bonisolli was a
distinctively wooden actor. He
sang quite well during the first
act—and indeed quite well
throughout, but noticeable varia
tions in his performance began
during the second act. At the
beginning of the act he started to
anticipate his long notes, seem
ingly well ahead of the orchestra,
as though he were deliberately
trying to show his audience how
talented his vocal chords really
are. He didn't have to do that; his
tenor is terrific. One cannot help
but wonder if he weren't some
how competing with Pilou and
Wixell for applause. There were
short periods where his voice was
noticeably strained, as though
trying to master a volume level
exhibited by Pilou and Wixell
which he would not attain.
At the end of his "Di Pro
vensa," I heard someone say of
Ingvar Wixell, "Wasn't he great?"
As the elder Germont, he was
precisely that—very unlike the
Wixell one recalls of two years
ago. His performance was much
more polished both in terms of
singing and acting. His voice was
in such good form in Traviata, one
cannot help but suspect that he
may be, as a baritone, matchless
this season. But there is one
annoying trait of the old Wixell
still left—his proclivity to taking
much more than furtive glances at
the prompter's box. His move
ments are so oriented on stage as
to wedge his head into that little
space on center stage at least
twenty separate times a minute. If
he would cut that single thing out
of his repertoire, his performances
would become significantly more
improved.
The San Francisco Opera is
currently in its forty-seventh
season, and very possibly this
year's l-a Traviata may rank as
one of its more impressive pro
ductions. Traviata is a product of
that prolific music man of the
nineteenth century, Giuseppe
Verdi. The story is adapted from a
Dumas novelette, and it is typ
ically one of the ad nauseum
tragic tales of that time. Musical
ly, however, the opera is some
thing else; it is full of exquisite
orchestral leitmotif with rich
underlying vocal li«*l canto.
La Traviata was a box office
sellout this year. If you're the
type of person who can't tolerate
the thought of old Jeanette
Mac Donald movies, consider your
self lucky to have missed this
story—last Saturday night was its
final performance. But if you're
the type of person who becomes
turned on by musical master
peices, you have undoubtedly
missed a rare treat this season.

Violetta Valery is the heroine
of this opera, a sort of nineteenth
century Parisian Pearl Mesta. The
action begins with a large party
taking place in Violetta's salon
with guests and spirits (liquid
rather than levitating) abounding.
It is not long before we learn
Violetta's major shortcoming: in a
coughing fit that could only be
duplicated in an anti-smoking
commercial for the American
Cancer Society, she displays to us
a rather nasty case of acute
consumption. Alfredo Germont, a
guest at the party and iminently
Violetta's overpassionate lover,
rushes to her side and declares—of
all things—his undying love for
her. From this moment on we are
deeply entrenched in mush.
The plot is fairly straight-line
throughout; only occasionally
does it become invaginated with
the slightest bit of intrigue and
suspense: Hoy meets girl, boy falls
in love with girl (reciprocally
engaging), as a concomitant the
girl is probably dying. And then
the intrigue: Boy's father is a real
proper Parisian pere.
It seems that Alfredo's sister
wants to marry a fairly prominent
man-about-town, and it occurs to
the elder Germont that Violetta
and Alfredo, living together in
fairly open secrecy, are doing
nothing to enhance the purity of
the family name. So girl leaves
boy and goes to the big city ; there
girl finds a more socially inclined
companion (those are nice words).
As expected, Alfredo comes
marching in, assesses the situation,
and promptly challenges the new
comer to a duel.
As the last scene opens we can
infer that Alfredo has come away
from the shooting match un
harmed. Several months have
obviously elapsed since that time
because Violetta's cough is notice
ably worse. The heroine bemoans
Alfredo's disappearance, claiming
that she really only loved him.
Musically she expounds her
desire for his swift return—which
naturally is a no-sooner-said-than
done occurrence. But, alas, the
consumption is too great an
obstacle, medicine being what it

The San Francisco Opera is
currently in its forty-seventh
season, and very possibly this
year's l-a Traviata may rank as
one of its more impressive pro
ductions. Traviata is a product of
that prolific music man of the
nineteenth century, Giuseppe
Verdi. The story is adapted from a
Dumas novelette, and it is typ
ically one of the ad nauseum
tragic tales of that time. Musical
ly, however, the opera is some
thing else; it is full of exquisite
orchestral leitmotif with rich
underlying vocal li«*l canto.
La Traviata was a box office
sellout this year. If you're the
type of person who can't tolerate
the thought of old Jeanette
Mac Donald movies, consider your
self lucky to have missed this
story—last Saturday night was its
final performance. But if you're
the type of person who becomes
turned on by musical master
peices, you have undoubtedly
missed a rare treat this season.

Violetta Valery is the heroine
of this opera, a sort of nineteenth
century Parisian Pearl Mesta. The
action begins with a large party
taking place in Violetta's salon
with guests and spirits (liquid
rather than levitating) abounding.
It is not long before we learn
Violetta's major shortcoming: in a
coughing fit that could only be
duplicated in an anti-smoking
commercial for the American
Cancer Society, she displays to us
a rather nasty case of acute
consumption. Alfredo Germont, a
guest at the party and iminently
Violetta's overpassionate lover,
rushes to her side and declares—of
all things—his undying love for
her. From this moment on we are
deeply entrenched in mush.
The plot is fairly straight-line
throughout; only occasionally
does it become invaginated with
the slightest bit of intrigue and
suspense: Hoy meets girl, boy falls
in love with girl (reciprocally
engaging), as a concomitant the
girl is probably dying. And then
the intrigue: Boy's father is a real
proper Parisian pere.
It seems that Alfredo's sister
wants to marry a fairly prominent
man-about-town, and it occurs to
the elder Germont that Violetta
and Alfredo, living together in
fairly open secrecy, are doing
nothing to enhance the purity of
the family name. So girl leaves
boy and goes to the big city ; there
girl finds a more socially inclined
companion (those are nice words).
As expected, Alfredo comes
marching in, assesses the situation,
and promptly challenges the new
comer to a duel.
As the last scene opens we can
infer that Alfredo has come away
from the shooting match un
harmed. Several months have
obviously elapsed since that time
because Violetta's cough is notice
ably worse. The heroine bemoans
Alfredo's disappearance, claiming
that she really only loved him.
Musically she expounds her
desire for his swift return—which
naturally is a no-sooner-said-than
done occurrence. But, alas, the
consumption is too great an
obstacle, medicine being what it
was in the nineteenth century,
and she dies in Alfredo's arms.
Truly a stunning story that only
Ronald Reagan could love!
Un the other hand we have

not to mention magnificent ex
amples of gala operatic produc
tion. Jeanette Pilou played as
astoundingly good Violetta with a
powerful soprano delivery. The
colaratura demanded of her role
at the end of the first was
superb, and one couldn't help but
say at the end of her "Sempre
Libera," "Don't you wish everyone
could sing like that?" The tre
mendously exciting thing about
Jeanette Pilou, aside from ability
to sing, is her ability to act. She
unquestionably gets into Violetta;
she understands what makes that
character tick
When compared to Pilou every
one else was quite weak—in the
acting department anyway. Her
Alfredo, Franco Bonisolli was a
distinctively wooden actor. He
sang quite well during the first
act—and indeed quite well
throughout, but noticeable varia
tions in his performance began
during the second act. At the
beginning of the act he started to
anticipate his long notes, seem
ingly well ahead of the orchestra,
as though he were deliberately
trying to show his audience how
talented his vocal chords really
are. He didn't have to do that; his
tenor is terrific. One cannot help
but wonder if he weren't some
how competing with Pilou and
Wixell for applause. There were
short periods where his voice was
noticeably strained, as though
trying to master a volume level
exhibited by Pilou and Wixell
which he would not attain.
At the end of his "Di Pro
vensa," I heard someone say of
Ingvar Wixell, "Wasn't he great?"
As the elder Germont, he was
precisely that—very unlike the
Wixell one recalls of two years
ago. His performance was much
more polished both in terms of
singing and acting. His voice was
in such good form in Traviata, one
cannot help but suspect that he
may be, as a baritone, matchless
this season. But there is one
annoying trait of the old Wixell
still left—his proclivity to taking
much more than furtive glances at
the prompter's box. His move
ments are so oriented on stage as
to wedge his head into that little
space on center stage at least
twenty separate times a minute. If
he would cut that single thing out
