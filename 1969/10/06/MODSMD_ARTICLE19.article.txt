# Truffaut, Dietrich On Tap
## 
### TODD McCARTHY 
Marlene Dietrich's American
debut, a seldom-seen Godard,
Truffaut's best film, a uniquely
American classic and a seriously
underrated British satire highlight
this week's movie schedule.
Clive Miller will present three
films this Tuesday in Geology
320. The Golf Specialist was VV.C.
Field's first sound picture and is
one of his best shorts, as he
recreates his famous golf act
which had been so successful on
stage. The White Zombie is a
relatively short horror film fea
turing Bela Lugosi. After their
smashing success with The Blue
Angel, Marlene Dietrich and direc
tor Josef von Sternberg came to
Hollywood to make Morocco. An
eloquent, expressive film, Moroc
co represents a fortunate oppor
tunity to at least sample the work
of von Sternberg, one of our best
directors who sank into oblivion
more quietly than Chaplin, von
Stroheim or Welles.
Ballet & Opera Films
A new series of ballet and opera
films begins this Wednesday with
Tales of Hoffman. Made in 1957,
the film offers Leonide Massine
and Moira Shearer supported by
the Royal Philharmonic. Showings
will begin at 7:30 and 8:30.
I haven't been able to find any
background material on El Ver

dugo, this week's International
Center film, but I will relay any
information if it becomes avail
able. In any case, the picture will
be shown at 7:45 on Thursday l in
Cubberley.
Le Petit Soldat was Godard's
first political film, which dealt
with but did not resolve the issues
surrounding the Algerian War. The
lead character is that of an
uncommitted intellectual and, in
many ways, resembles Godard
himself. Anna Karina is featured
in this 1960 production which
will be shown on Friday at
Tresidder.
Truflaut's Gangsters
One of my own four or five
favorite films of all-time is Shoot
the Piano Player, which will be
shown on Friday at 7:30 and 9:30
in Cubberley. Though Truffaut
adapted the picture from an
American gangster novel, it is so
tender and melancholy at its heart
that it betrays any categorization.
Charles Aznavour is perfect as the
disheartened pianist and Georges
Delerue's score could be the most
haunting even composed for a
film. Strategic planning makes it
possible to see this and Le Petit
Soldat on Friday night; at
tendance at both is highly recom
mended.
[ All About Eve has always been
marred by a pretentious ending
and today seems somewhat
elongated, but the magnificent,
bitchy dialogue remains joyously
intact, as do the sterling perform
ances of Bette Davis, Anne
Baxter, George Sanders, Celeste
Holm, Gary Merrill and Thelma
Ritter. This 1950 Academy
Award winner will be shown on
Saturday night at Tresidder.
i Bedazzled was generally over
• looked upon its release in 1967, a
1 curious happenstance in light of
[ the pathetic state of screen satire
i in this era and even more curious
lin that the film is so hilarious. The
brilliant Peter Cook and Dudley
Moore (Beyond the Fringe) are
largely responsible for the pic
ture's sharp satiric edge, while
director Stanley Donen skillfully
keeps the two maniacs under
reasonable control as he imbues
i the film with a special, even
1 stunning visual quality all his own.

Cubberley.
Marlene Dietrich's American
debut, a seldom-seen Godard,
Truffaut's best film, a uniquely
American classic and a seriously
underrated British satire highlight
this week's movie schedule.
Clive Miller will present three
films this Tuesday in Geology
320. The Golf Specialist was VV.C.
Field's first sound picture and is
one of his best shorts, as he
recreates his famous golf act
which had been so successful on
stage. The White Zombie is a
relatively short horror film fea
turing Bela Lugosi. After their
smashing success with The Blue
Angel, Marlene Dietrich and direc
tor Josef von Sternberg came to
Hollywood to make Morocco. An
eloquent, expressive film, Moroc
co represents a fortunate oppor
tunity to at least sample the work
of von Sternberg, one of our best
directors who sank into oblivion
more quietly than Chaplin, von
Stroheim or Welles.
Ballet & Opera Films
A new series of ballet and opera
films begins this Wednesday with
Tales of Hoffman. Made in 1957,
the film offers Leonide Massine
and Moira Shearer supported by
the Royal Philharmonic. Showings
will begin at 7:30 and 8:30.
I haven't been able to find any
background material on El Ver

dugo, this week's International
Center film, but I will relay any
information if it becomes avail
able. In any case, the picture will
be shown at 7:45 on Thursday l in
Cubberley.
Le Petit Soldat was Godard's
first political film, which dealt
with but did not resolve the issues
surrounding the Algerian War. The
lead character is that of an
uncommitted intellectual and, in
many ways, resembles Godard
himself. Anna Karina is featured
in this 1960 production which
will be shown on Friday at
Tresidder.
Truflaut's Gangsters
One of my own four or five
favorite films of all-time is Shoot
the Piano Player, which will be
shown on Friday at 7:30 and 9:30
in Cubberley. Though Truffaut
adapted the picture from an
American gangster novel, it is so
tender and melancholy at its heart
that it betrays any categorization.
Charles Aznavour is perfect as the
disheartened pianist and Georges
Delerue's score could be the most

film. Strategic planning makes it
