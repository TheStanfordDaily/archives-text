# Vietnam Moratorium Opens Campus Drive
## 
### LARRY DIAMOND 
Plans are moving ahead rapidly
for the "Vietnam Moratorium
Day" at Stanford on October 15.
On that day, "business as usual"
will cease at Stanford, and on
college campuses around the
country, as concerned students
and faculty to to the public to
discuss the Vietnam War.
For anyone who has any
questions about the Moratorium,
who would like to sign up
individually for a specific activity
of Moratorium Day, or who
would like information about the
Vietnam War, a large booth will
be open from 9 a.m. to 5 p.m.
each day in the White Memorial
Plaza.
The grand opening of the
Vietnam Moratorium Booth will
be at noon today.

There will be a meeting tonight
at 8:00 at the ASSU office in the
Tresidder Union for all those
interested in helping to organize
and plan the final details of the
Moratorium. Students who wish
to volunteer their services before
the Moratorium Day may attend
this meeting or see someone in the
Booth in White Plaza.
The theory behind the
nationally organized Moratorium
movement is that the Vietnam
War will not end quickly unless
the public reasserts massive
pressure on the President. The
leaders of the movement believe
that this pressure must be
continuous and escalating if it is
to be effective.
The activities being planned for
the one day Moratorium in
October will therefore be
followed up with a 2-day
Moratorium in November, a 3-day
Moratorium in December, and so
on until the war ends.
On Wednesday, Oct. 15,
students will be canvassing the
surrounding residential areas
door-to-door, talking with people
about the war and what they can
do to protest its continuation.
Some students will be leafletting
and talking at shopping centers,
large factories, crowded
intersections, while others will be
riding the commuter trains.
A substantial number of
Stanford professors will not hold
classes that day, releasing their
students to participate actively in
the Moratorium movement. A
complete list, expected to exceed
200, of the Stanford professors

supporting the Moratorium is to
be published soon.
Outside organizations will be
encouraged to participate in the
Moratorium. The San Francisco
Office of the American Friends
Service Committee has already
announced that it will close on
October 15 to observe the
Vietnam Moratorium. Other local
organizations and merchants will
be encouraged to support the
movement in some tangible way.
On the Tuesday night before
the 15th, there will be a mass
meeting to initiate the
Moratorium, with speeches and
discussion.
On the following night, Oct.
15th, there will be an action
forum in the inner Quad area
featuring such speakers as Nobel
peace and chemistry prize winner,
Linus Pauling, Congressmen Pete
McCloskey (R-San Mateo) and
Don Edwards (D-San Jose), and
the editor of the black San
Francisco Sun Reporter, Carlton
Goodlett. Senator Alan Cranston
(D-California) and Stanford
Resistance member Paul Rupert
may also be speaking.
In preparation for Oct. 15, a
number of papers are being
prepared to brief students on the
facts and statistics of the war.
Noted faculty and students
who have worked on white papers
on the war, will be speaking in the
dorms the Monday night before
the 15th. In addition, concerned
students will be organizing their
dorms, their departments, and
their friends to get out and work
on Oct 15.
