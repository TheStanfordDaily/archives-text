### 
The Beta Chi Community for
the Performing Arts will begin
its Monday evening roundtable
discussions on the arts with
Joseph Brockett leading a talk
on "The Aquarian Age of Art."
Brockett feels, "The artist has
a responsibility to clarify the
transition into any age and to
perhaps suggest some guidelines
of response to change. As a
culture we are rapidly plunging
into an abyss of universal de
struction. The artist's responsi
bility then is more literally a
matter of life and death."
The talks begin at 7 p.m. or
come early for dinner—s2
per/person—at 6:15. All are
welcome.
