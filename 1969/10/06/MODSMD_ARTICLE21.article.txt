# Tribe Morale Survives One-Point Defeat
## 
### FRED MANN 
Jim Kauffman laughed. He
stood in the aisle of the chartered
jet and conducted a 2,000 mile
standing talk session on the way
to Lafayette, Indiana. He was
loose and ready to play football.
Thirty hours and one defeat later,
he was up in the aisle again. The
chatter was softer and not as
constant, but Kauffman was still
smiling.
Stanford was beaten by one
point by one of the nation's top
football teams on a hot, sticky
afternoon. The defeat was a
heartbreaker, but neither Kauff
man nor Coach John Ralston not
even the whole team could keep a
frown on for too long. They knew
that they were good.
The Indians took a big step up
in competition on Saturday, and
complimented that with a big step
up of their own—they played
first-class football.
Against Oregon the week be
fore, the Tribe was sloppy yet
walked off with a shutout win
(28-0). The first outing was even
sloppier, but the opponent was
San Jose State and there was
nothing to worry about. This time
the foe was Purdue University,
and the team couldn't afford to
make mistakes.
They didn't. Their best outing
of the year turned out to be a
36-35 loss to the Boilermakers,
the team rated eighth by both
wire service polls. And that may
be an understatement. Mike
Phipps more than lived up his
press releases as he led a powerful
Purdue offense. But then again so
did Jim Plunkett as he directed
Stanford all over the field. It
would be hard to find two finer
quarterbacks in the college ranks
today.
"If we can control the ball and
run, say 90 plays to their 70, we'll
have a chance to win," said
Stanford head scout and former
Purdue All-America Dutch Fehr
ing, before the game. Dutch was
not far off: the Indians ran 89
plays to 69 for Purdue, and
victory was almost theirs. In fact
the Cards led in nearly all
statistical departments. They piled
up 28 first downs, gained 231
yards running and 355 yards
passing for a total of 586 yards.
Plunkett threw 46 times and
completed half of them, and hit
for four touchdowns.
Unfortunately for the Tribe,
Phipps had his day with the
numbers as well. He set new
school records in everything as he
racked up 429 yards through the
air, hit for 28 of 39 passes, and
threw for five TD's. In the fourth
quarter when the Gold and Black
rallied for two touchdowns and
the all-important two point con
version, Phipps completed 13
passes in a row.

Purdue finished with fewer first
downs, total yardage, and of
fensive plays than Stanford—but
one more point.
Even the breaks and turnovers
wore split equally—or nearly so.
Both teams were penalized four
times, fumbled twice, and missed
a 14-yard field goal. Stanford
however lost both of their
fumbles (Purdue lost only one),
and Plunkett had two intercepted.
One fumble and interception in
the last two minutes killed the
Tribe come-back attempts.

Both sides had their chances to
cheer. Randy Cooper ran through
the Stanford line often enough,
and sophomore Ashley Bell drove
the Cards crazy with hook pat
terns over the middle. Dangerous
flanker Stan Brown from Rich
mond gained 67 yards for Purdue
and scored two TD's.
For the Indians, Bob Moore
was a bright spot as he hauled in
eight balls for 99 yards and two
touchdowns. Randy Vataha did a
dance down the sidelines for 47
vards in he second quarter to set

up the second Stanford score, and
Howie Williams tallied twice on a
run and a pass. Ron Kadziel
caught the final TD pass from 9
yards out. Bubba Brown spun off
tacklers all day, and the Cards
were not thrown for a loss until
the fourth quarter.
But no matter how impressive
everybody else was, the game was
still the quarterbacks. Phipps, a
straight drop back passer and
superb runner simply mutilated
the Big Red defense. If the long
pass was covered (which it was

often and well by Kauffman, Dick
Oliver and Rich Keller), he threw
screens. If the sideline screens
were gone, Phipps would hit Bell
over the middle. When everything
seemed blanketed, he ran up the
center. Bill Alexander and Dave
Tipton were on Phipps all day,
but he still got the ball of on his
way to the ground.
Plunkett was much the same.
He guided the Tribe to two scores
in the third quarter, he best
period of Stanford football in the
last two years. He threw at every
opportunity and ran the option
superbly. Only his fumble after a
17-yard run with a minute left
tarnished the performance. His
protection was excellent, and
Plunkett ran through a beautiful
two-minute drill to score as the
first half ended.
Coach Ralston could not even
fault his defense after the game.
"No one likes to give up 36 points
and over 500 yards, but they (the
defense) weren't accustomed to
this type of offense," he said.
Stanford concentrates on a
rushing defense, suited to contain
the roll-out passer. They play a
three-deep secondary and try to
stop plays up front. Phipps, like
Plunkett, is a pocket passer, and
beat the Tribe defense easily.
"Most Pacific-8 quarterbacks
are roll-out types," commented
Ralston, "and we weren't going to
change our whole approach for a
non-conference game." The only
Pac-8 drop back passer, aside from
Plunkett, is UCLA's Dennis
Dummitt.
"I'm very proud of our team,"
the coach added. "We tried to
keep them off balance, but
couldn't contain Phipps. Actually,
he surprised us. I really never
thought he could throw like
that."
Aside from some muscle
cramps caused by humidity, Stan
ford is in excellent shape for
Saturday night's showdown in
L.A. with USC. Indian luck in
Mayor Sam's fair city has been
running pretty low of late. The
last Tribe victory in the Coliseum
was in 1962 over UCLA.
"I know the Purdue game will
help us for SC," said Ralston.
"We've played equally with a
tough team, and now we're ready.
Jimmy Jones (SC's black quarter
back) just couldn't be as tough as
Phipps!"
Stanford 7 14 14 0 —35

CONFRONTATION—Jim Piunkctt gets a close look at Purdue's interior line
Saturday and finds that Ron Maree (74) actually is 6-6, 274, as center John
Sande (55) protects. Purdue's Mike Pliipps hurled 39 passes and Plunkett 46 in
the tense meeting of the nation's premier aerial specialists.
