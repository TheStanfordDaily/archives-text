# Massimino Leads Stanford Poloists
## 
### 
Stanford's water polo team
won three of four games this
weekend, but they could still
manage only a fifth place finish in
the Northern California Invita
tional Tournament at Foothill
College.
In the opening round against
Long Beach City College. Stan
ford survived a second-quarter
letdown in which they gave up
four goals, and the Indians rallied
from a 6-4 defecit to score three
times in the last quarter to defeat
LBCC, 7-6. The winning goal was
scored by Hill with less than 40
seconds remaining.
Stanford then had the mis
fortune of drawing pre-tourn
ament favorite De Anza Aquatic
Club. As expected DAAC routed
the Indians 10-4. Leading De
Anza's attack was former Stan
ford and Olympic star Gary
Sheerer who put on an awesome
display of scoring as he picked up
seven goals. As usual sophomore
Rick Massimino played another
great game as he scored three
goals for the second game in a
row.
With their backs against the
wall, the Indians came back with a
sterling performance on Saturday
as they beat both University of
Pacific and San Jose State to
salvage fifth place in the tourney.
Stanford defeated UOP 11-4 as
they showed a well balanced

scoring attack and a fine offense
throughout the game. In the game
for fifth place the Indians de
feated SJS 5-3. The Spartans had
been unofficial national cham
pions last year and they were
expected to be tough again this
year.
But the Indians rose to he
occasion with a fine overall effort.
Outstanding in this game was
goalie Peter Gadd who shut out
the Spartans until 2:00 remaining
in the third quarter. An agressive
SJS defense kept Massimino in
check for most of the game, but
the sophomore star still managed
once again to score three im
portant goals.
